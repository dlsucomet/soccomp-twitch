# soccomp-twitch
for the cscw project on twitch social computing analyses


up next:
top 50 streamers with rules
top 50 streamers with no rules
regardless of subscriber/view count
then do top 20 of similar subscriber count of both with and without rules
to see if comparing them side by side given that would give more insight
like grouping them by some kind of counting
like for 1-5M viewers, there are the top 5
for 500k-1M viewers, there are the top 5
for both with and without rules. 
tiered analysis..
