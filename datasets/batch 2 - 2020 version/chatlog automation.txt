Run this command to automate:

FOR /F %G IN (filename) DO twitch-chatlog %G > "pathname\%G.txt"

>>This will loop through multiple executions of "twitch-chatlog" at the same time outputting it into a txt file.

>>Some outputs may be empty resulting in 1kb or 0kb txt files. Recommendation: Delete it.

>>Some executions may fail causing the process to become stuck. Use Ctrl+C then enter N/n, do not input Y/y (it will terminate batch process).

>>Make sure the txt file contains the numbers on separate lines and contains no other special characters in that same line.
