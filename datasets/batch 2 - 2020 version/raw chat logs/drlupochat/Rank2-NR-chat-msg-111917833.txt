[01/2/17, 5:50:34 PM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 4000+ hours over ~18 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller.
