[01/8/17, 4:04:10 AM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 4000+ hours over ~18 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller.

[01/8/17, 4:06:20 AM] <raspberryfizz> lupoLURK
[01/8/17, 4:06:20 AM] <MasterYodaUC> hey is greg sippel
[01/8/17, 4:06:22 AM] <moistpeaches> yeah it sucks cause the entire game Jake's been saying be respectful and some people just don't get the message
[01/8/17, 4:06:23 AM] <twisters364> He is asking people to be respectful too in his stream
[01/8/17, 4:06:24 AM] <nanabatman1335> I guess that works, I'm no where near as good as jake or lupo, just seems easier to use the bubble in a close round as opposed to one you have a good shot at winning, i get it tho, thanks guys
[01/8/17, 4:06:28 AM] <coolbeansy0y0> Jake vs lupo no way
[01/8/17, 4:06:37 AM] <galaxyj15> jake and lupo don't hate each other....at least from my knowledge I know they are both friends
[01/8/17, 4:06:41 AM] <AllgoodGMR> I'm enjoying going back in forth from the streams. But I prefer Lupo over Jake.
[01/8/17, 4:06:42 AM] <IAmNotScottish> @Samiam3356, Everyone has off days lupoK
