[02/26/17, 2:59:15 AM] <TheSmokingRotoscope> @beatnik28 You might be able to get away with Smallbore on a Luna, but not much else
[02/26/17, 2:59:16 AM] <Siulaim> @Seraphv2, i don't think anyone would argue that braced is better than rifled. just that it does appear to be viable now. rifled may not make or break a roll like it used to
[02/26/17, 2:59:17 AM] <LANAAAAAAAA> @DovaKiten ay I'm always down to shoot faces with cool people, feel free to add me and inv whenever
[02/26/17, 2:59:21 AM] <xastey> @beatnik28 true.. I just get a lot of pallies that suck.. like LitC, smallbore + icarus
[02/26/17, 2:59:26 AM] <TheSmokingRotoscope> @beatnik28 Even still, you'd need RF to compensate
[02/26/17, 2:59:31 AM] <xastey> so no range at all
[02/26/17, 2:59:39 AM] <amisj530> kreygasm1 swiftrage1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1
[02/26/17, 2:59:54 AM] <Siulaim> @xastey, i would definitely hang on to a LITC, smallbore, icarus pally now. give it a go
[02/26/17, 3:00:04 AM] <beatnik28> @thesmokingrotoscope yeah my Luna is SB & RF. Totally different story, imo. And choose maps accordingly rambPLS
[02/26/17, 3:00:04 AM] <DovaKiten> @LANAAAAAAAA love you lupoLOVE once I actually get it, im just gunna collect gamertags from chat and do a massive friending rampage lolol
[02/26/17, 3:00:05 AM] <Siulaim> smaller maps might be good
[02/26/17, 3:00:06 AM] <xastey> so if you stay at A and C lanes they always spawn c?

[02/26/17, 3:00:33 AM] <LANAAAAAAAA> @DovaKiten Hell yeah dude, that would be awesome
[02/26/17, 3:00:35 AM] <TheSmokingRotoscope> @beatnik28 Definitely. You'll want the range on something like Rusted Lands or Exodus, but you'll be fine on Anomaly
[02/26/17, 3:00:35 AM] <DovaKiten> Shoe is absolutely right. Thats a great roll to experiment
[02/26/17, 3:00:37 AM] <LANAAAAAAAA> lupoLOVE
