[08/17/17, 11:34:33 PM] <MFFoXX> @ohnolookoutbelow yeah, i tried with b for a while but it's very uncomfortable for me personally. i caught myself looking for it regularly which is a no no in a tense situation. i use t in other games and it's normal for me
[08/17/17, 11:34:44 PM] <MFFoXX> i think T is voice or something for default rhoufh

[08/17/17, 11:38:02 PM] <MFFoXX> @DrLupo i dont think you've told him about breathing still
[08/17/17, 11:38:24 PM] <Gatsurendo> he doesn't need zoom. His eyes have a natural adjusting optic built in
[08/17/17, 11:38:29 PM] <Llera> dggMMM lupoBOOTY
[08/17/17, 11:38:30 PM] <ScootieMcGavin> I always forget to look at the zoom when its there

[08/17/17, 11:39:15 PM] <MFFoXX> scar iron sights AKA being forcefully blinded
[08/17/17, 11:39:24 PM] <ShotgunNinja> ^^
[08/17/17, 11:39:26 PM] <Chopstick72_> ^^^ lol
[08/17/17, 11:39:32 PM] <Gatsurendo> wonder if the person is above them
[08/17/17, 11:39:49 PM] <GregSippel> you know whats funny. i hate the scar irons in this game but like in MW2 i loved the irons for it
[08/17/17, 11:40:11 PM] <Gatsurendo> in MW2 it's also angled correctly though
[08/17/17, 11:40:11 PM] <MFFoXX> i feel like COD's iron sights are better in general
[08/17/17, 11:40:18 PM] <Gatsurendo> this one screws your angle
[08/17/17, 11:40:37 PM] <MFFoXX> and it takes up roughly 2/3rds on your screen
[08/17/17, 11:40:48 PM] <Gatsurendo> yup
[08/17/17, 11:41:21 PM] <Action345jackson> I love that jake is playing aggressive too lupoYE
[08/17/17, 11:41:25 PM] <RedDawnBurning> haha I jump instream and jake is down. seems about right

[08/17/17, 11:42:40 PM] <LogicForDays> sup @drlupo jake needs a vest if you see one
[08/17/17, 11:42:43 PM] <MFFoXX> @DrLupo if he is more comfortable with E for interact, it wont make any major difference to change it. having it double bound doesnt cause problems

[08/17/17, 11:43:42 PM] <Extra_Introverted> @DrLupo makes playing video games look like riding a bike. For Jake, it's more like riding a horse.
[08/17/17, 11:43:52 PM] <Anaxamander> whats a fisix?
[08/17/17, 11:43:55 PM] <coldshock_> As a physicist I can confirm that is true to life physics.

[08/17/17, 11:44:38 PM] <xenaxis78> Not sure he realizes he can carry multiple scopes in inventory. He dropped a 4X and 2X.

[08/17/17, 11:46:36 PM] <ShotgunNinja> @Jakichan32 I ask myself this all the time
[08/17/17, 11:46:37 PM] <MFFoXX> i'm probably stupid for this, but might be valuable to mention that X is also how you switch back to fists if you run out of ammo and need to punch a hater out
