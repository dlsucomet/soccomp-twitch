[08/29/18, 1:04:35 AM] <dwLucid> is this game new?
[08/29/18, 1:04:37 AM] <NinjaTexan> @drlupo if you struggle with the strafe jump swap right click and space bar
[08/29/18, 1:04:38 AM] <douthinkhesarus> I'm a little disappointed in myself this game has been around for so long and I've never played it.
[08/29/18, 1:04:38 AM] <mcshane24> @DrLupo curious why you don't set your fps limit to higher than 165?
[08/29/18, 1:04:40 AM] <mowxxlincoln> @l1lsl3gend @twagher and we’re the three best friends that anyone could have. LUL LUL
[08/29/18, 1:04:49 AM] <JustEuranian> Same @jdegner20
[08/29/18, 1:04:49 AM] <Draec> LOOOOOOOOOOOT
[08/29/18, 1:04:49 AM] <theshadowhand> @Cyrus_Paragon_ UT has gotten slower, and Quake has always been faster
[08/29/18, 1:04:50 AM] <Bruisr> 165fps is plenty. You can't really tell much difference beyond it
[08/29/18, 1:04:52 AM] <HollyWoood> boy i was waiting for quake stuff
[08/29/18, 1:04:53 AM] <Cyrus_Paragon_> mother of god @theshadowhand
[08/29/18, 1:04:58 AM] <jieep> it looks so Hardcore
[08/29/18, 1:05:14 AM] <l1ll3gend> @mowxxlincoln I’m sure they’ll be ecstatic, only the most successful live at home with their parents for their whole life!
