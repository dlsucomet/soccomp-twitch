[03/13/16, 6:29:48 AM] <Nightbot> The SECRET CHOO CHOO occurs when we decide to find an unsuspecting victim on DestinyLFG.net or similar locations on the internet. We find someone who has never been to The Lighthouse, and pick them up without mentioning who we are. We run them 9-0, then drop a little surprise on them afterwards. ;)
