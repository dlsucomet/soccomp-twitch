[03/13/16, 11:15:42 AM] <Nightbot> Tonight, DrLupo will be helping FalloutPlays with a little event called INTRO TO SWEATS! If you're looking to get in, head over to twitch.tv/falloutplays (X1) or twitch.tv/drybonez81 (PS4) and check it out! Each series will be a set of 3 games focusing on advanced strategies and cross map silliness.

[03/13/16, 11:17:21 AM] <Mai7Viac> @Edg4rallanbro have you tried Viagra?
[03/13/16, 11:17:24 AM] <Edg4rAllanBro> @Caethy both teams agreed to not grab heavy
[03/13/16, 11:17:28 AM] <cIawr> @Drlupo Not gonna lie ... I hope you get a 1KYS with viewtac so you can use your IPAD for Xbox and PS4 Kappa

[03/13/16, 11:18:43 AM] <Caethy> To be entirely fair, it's not that heavy is too good, it's just that primaries are so awful compared to specials/heavies.
