[03/29/16, 9:21:02 AM] <Nightbot> Selection is RANDOM, whether !virgin or an open roll. You just need to be active in chat. No need to follow, donate, etc. Selection follows these rules: 1. One run per person, per weekend. 2. If you do NOT get to 9-0, you are able to be selected again on any days remaining that weekend. 3. If you went 9-0 one of the previous two weekends, you are not eligible for the current weekend.
