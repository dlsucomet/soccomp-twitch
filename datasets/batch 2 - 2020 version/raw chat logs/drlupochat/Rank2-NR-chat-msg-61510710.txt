[04/19/16, 11:10:48 AM] <kikjiji> Why did you choose keyboard instead controller?@drlupo
[04/19/16, 11:10:57 AM] <THEmattyj8> !whymnk
[04/19/16, 11:10:57 AM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 2500+ hours over ~9 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller.

[04/19/16, 11:11:11 AM] <ManOfCole> Lupo is bad at being bad
