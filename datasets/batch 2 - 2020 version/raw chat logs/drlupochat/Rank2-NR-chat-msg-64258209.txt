[05/3/16, 4:38:01 AM] <Montsylvania> @Drlupo today at Butt Touch University the TA in our lab told us that there was a distinct philosophy between butt touching with the left hand and the right hand. She said we weren't advanced enough to discuss it. Would you be able to tell us the real scoop here?

One run per person, per weekend. 2. If you do NOT get to 9-0, you are able to be selected again on any days remaining that weekend. 3. If you went 9-0 one of the previous two weekends, you are not eligible for the current weekend.
