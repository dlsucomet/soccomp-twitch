[05/3/16, 11:00:17 AM] <ekchamps> Poor stormcaller why you do that to him 😂
[05/3/16, 11:00:23 AM] <K3x707x> that stormcaller's shoes are still on the ground over there

[05/3/16, 11:00:32 AM] <deflatessb> All he had to do was jump and he would've gotten you
[05/3/16, 11:00:41 AM] <greg0409> I think he's contemplating wether or not do run storm caller ever again
[05/3/16, 11:00:44 AM] <DEANa89> 2 month anniversary, how does that even make sense
[05/3/16, 11:00:45 AM] <greg0409> whether*
[05/3/16, 11:00:45 AM] <itybitygangster> will never click the Strom caller again all because of you
[05/3/16, 11:00:46 AM] <A_Valar> From what this guy is saying it almost seems like he is eat thing stream?
[05/3/16, 11:00:52 AM] <A_Valar> Watcging
[05/3/16, 11:00:53 AM] <rockerdude> Do ppl really just sit there all staring at the same place?
