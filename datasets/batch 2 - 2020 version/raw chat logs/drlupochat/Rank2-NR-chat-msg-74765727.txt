[06/27/16, 3:08:09 AM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 3200+ hours over ~12 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller. More info: https://goo.gl/DK62Er
[06/27/16, 3:08:13 AM] <therealFoxP3> @Morphine92, people like to see how lupo writes emails.

[06/27/16, 3:09:05 AM] <therealFoxP3> @TruffleButterandJelly, a hand model would never use a keyboard....too risky. have you seen those people?
