[07/11/16, 11:02:44 PM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 3200+ hours over ~12 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller.
