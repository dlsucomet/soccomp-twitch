[07/30/16, 1:33:28 PM] <Stiff_Gators> @stonosapien so many sherpees have to experience that crap when they just wanna have some fun and paly and they run into a salty, toxic player. Me and my teammate actually met on lfg, but we played for fun and didn't expect to win. We got along well and had fun and that's all that mattered. We got to a decent standard in time but we knew it would take time.
