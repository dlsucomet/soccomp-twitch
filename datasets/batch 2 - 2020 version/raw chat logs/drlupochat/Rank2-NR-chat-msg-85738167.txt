[08/26/16, 10:19:27 AM] <DrLupo> @TheTrueVanguard, one more on sticks then switching back to MnK

[08/26/16, 10:19:34 AM] <tykeoon> heard deej say dr lupos satanic koala
[08/26/16, 10:19:35 AM] <Mr_DRG> Dude - you're doing WAY better than I (or pretty much anyone else I know) could do when switching from MnK to Controller for the first time in months; props
[08/26/16, 10:19:35 AM] <Mai7Viac> @Morep1ay, yep!
[08/26/16, 10:19:35 AM] <mdk99> Why they would ban MnK in MLG? This is bad
[08/26/16, 10:19:40 AM] <iiS1L3NTxSH0T> @DrLupo, you should just cop a Scuf or something
[08/26/16, 10:19:41 AM] <djentleman91> @DrLupo so...Scuf? Would you use one?
[08/26/16, 10:19:42 AM] <Eviltrotter> can you keyboard and mouse in sweaty tourneys?

[08/26/16, 10:22:45 AM] <Essential_integers> @Stiff_Gators hopping you can get reinforced and quickddraw on it
[08/26/16, 10:22:48 AM] <OozyPunk> @Essential_integers, is that confirmed? because i will grind for that forever, that is if its stats and hidden stats are the exact same.
[08/26/16, 10:22:50 AM] <mollymayisme> @mr_drg it's the battle to out-nice each other.

[08/26/16, 10:22:55 AM] <Aodan> !WHYCONTROLLER
[08/26/16, 10:22:55 AM] <Nightbot> Because it might be banned in anything MLG, so I might as well practice - just in case.

[08/26/16, 10:23:30 AM] <ChaoticCosmo> legolas!!!
[08/26/16, 10:23:31 AM] <Aodan> I think its simply bullcrap that MLG would ban Mouse/KB if players are allowed to use scuff gaming controllers/etc
[08/26/16, 10:23:31 AM] <mooneyx> @essential_integers ya
[08/26/16, 10:23:34 AM] <OozyPunk> @Essential_integers, whisper it to me for later.
[08/26/16, 10:23:35 AM] <Stiff_Gators> @Essential_integers the roll they showed was Linear Compensator/Quickdraw/Reinforced Barrel/Rangefinder
[08/26/16, 10:23:35 AM] <Mr_DRG> #AgeGap
[08/26/16, 10:23:37 AM] <doctorx13> @mr_drg that is the most correct statement known to man.
[08/26/16, 10:23:46 AM] <RubyRubay> @Aodan, we don't know if it's going to be banned yet
[08/26/16, 10:23:50 AM] <xAggressiveTuna> Are u using a controller?!?
[08/26/16, 10:23:50 AM] <Essential_integers> @Stiff_Gators hopping that's the vendor one
[08/26/16, 10:23:54 AM] <Mai7Viac> @xaggressivetuna, he is
[08/26/16, 10:23:55 AM] <TheMajorTool> Awesome to see all these viewers!
[08/26/16, 10:23:58 AM] <bayofblood> @stiff_gators that roll sounds insane
[08/26/16, 10:24:01 AM] <Essential_integers> @mooneyx want it pmed too you too?
[08/26/16, 10:24:08 AM] <Aodan> @RubyRubay welcome to MLG.. even though it's owned by Blizzard they are unorganized with rulesets
[08/26/16, 10:24:15 AM] <Stiff_Gators> @Essential_integers Dysclosure told me it was the vendor roll but don't know how he knows
[08/26/16, 10:24:27 AM] <Aodan> @RubyRubay ESL isn't much better, but you would know at least a month ahead in the OW scene (PC player who may play destiny)

[08/26/16, 10:25:15 AM] <RubyRubay> @Aodan, I used to compete in CoD, the rules were consistent but they haven't done Destiny before, they get a little slack since it's a new setup
[08/26/16, 10:25:19 AM] <Essential_integers> @mooneyx welc
[08/26/16, 10:25:23 AM] <Essential_integers> @Oozypunk got it?

[08/26/16, 10:25:27 AM] <OozyPunk> @Essential_integers, while it looks good. i can see some issues, we dont know how it handles, or its pellet spread, also i feel that having 1 perk and 2 middle trees is less effective then having 2 perks, albiet it makes it easier to find a potential god roll.

[08/26/16, 10:25:34 AM] <Stiff_Gators> @Essential_integers It's good that we can decide what package rewards we get (armour or weapon) for faction rankups. I'm saving motes of light and materials like mad haha

[08/26/16, 10:26:40 AM] <Mr_DRG> It was @thetruevanguard , On top of Pillar, WITH THE LAST WORD!
[08/26/16, 10:26:41 AM] <Aodan> @RubyRubay CoD is weathered, CSGO, LoL, DotA2, etc just cause they haven't doen't destiny doesn't mean they shouldn't understand rulesets. For controllers, the #1 argument from "console" players is they use a controller cause they "prefer" it. If You have custom scuff/etc they should allow XIM just ban any kind of macro
[08/26/16, 10:26:45 AM] <Mai7Viac> @MouseRat_fan, that's @MrsDrLupo his wife

[08/26/16, 10:28:18 AM] <Tachikoma702> Dr Lupo, you still play at sensitive 10 with your controller?
[08/26/16, 10:28:22 AM] <RubyRubay> @jstry1991, this is not really the place for stream setup. I would suggest checking someplace like the Twitch subreddit; they've got a lot of streamers there who can give advice.

[08/26/16, 10:28:30 AM] <Aodan> @RubyRubay oh no, I gotcha bro. I'm just saying from a hardcore PC players perspective, if they are going to make Destiny Competitive, you can't allow controllers and not kbm. The only issue should be "macros"
