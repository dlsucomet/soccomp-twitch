[10/31/16, 10:55:18 AM] <Nightbot> Originally, I looked for an alternate input method that would allow me to rez/move/shoot/jump/etc at the same time. I also get hand cramps after playing for too long with a controller. I've put 3700+ hours over ~14 months into learning to play this way on Destiny. I also own an Elite controller.
