[11/18/16, 11:39:47 AM] <harrisonnotford> he worded it poorly. cast at a higher lv
[11/18/16, 11:39:52 AM] <RalinAura> So Matt either forgot or just decided that this pit fiend doesn't have fear aura
[11/18/16, 11:39:54 AM] <cursedseishi> no sneak attack crit. Ghurix technically initiated combat by summoning the Erynes
[11/18/16, 11:39:59 AM] <Darzharm> @drangton Like 3 turns into the first round of combat
[11/18/16, 11:39:59 AM] <Crystianvenus> bad news
[11/18/16, 11:40:03 AM] <bobarris> my party fought a pit fiend 2 months ago and killed him 3 rounds heros feast was the deciding factor.
[11/18/16, 11:40:03 AM] <M3lk0r333> Everyone always says Matt's mad, he's not that kind of dm imo... what makes him mad is meta gaming and doing crap your character wouldn't do.
[11/18/16, 11:40:04 AM] <SlipZoneX> Vax in the Air will draw guards
[11/18/16, 11:40:06 AM] <Saiyanfox10> and remember guys: there are 3 Vaxs' and 3 Vexs'

[11/18/16, 11:40:38 AM] <Nightbot> For D&D enthusiasts who are curious, the Critical Role Team is playing a modified version of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition converted from Pathfinder.
[11/18/16, 11:40:39 AM] <jhawk92> cool
[11/18/16, 11:40:39 AM] <Mattrick360> Was wings a bonus action?
[11/18/16, 11:40:39 AM] <Matzrim> This setup is so nice for them. I think they will live.

[11/18/16, 11:41:03 AM] <rupenstein> So used to Pathfinder... 22 hitting is nice
[11/18/16, 11:41:05 AM] <BurakkuWolf> its a good thing i dont follow the numbers vax has missed so much dmg on the show
[11/18/16, 11:41:06 AM] <GaeaCa> @thevalyriansteel, about 20 mins of game
[11/18/16, 11:41:06 AM] <NeverwinterFool> Good idea, he'll have problems breaking grapple
[11/18/16, 11:41:06 AM] <Kootiepatra> @Mattrick360 The wings were already out last week
[11/18/16, 11:41:06 AM] <cinderellas1shoo82> i just checked my spell cards it is not concentration
[11/18/16, 11:41:07 AM] <Crucifer2005> Since the pitfiend cant see the doorway percy is just a gun and a hand from midair shooting...the rest of him is not visible lol
[11/18/16, 11:41:08 AM] <scorumdeathmetal> I hope they don't die when I go to work in 1 hour.
[11/18/16, 11:41:09 AM] <frogmood> so far, keyleth got them wet, grog hugged the pit fiend, and vax whispered in his ear with his dagger
[11/18/16, 11:41:12 AM] <theburklepersona> But if he goes through the doorway, does the hex go away?
[11/18/16, 11:41:14 AM] <Souledex> Its concentration but its a level one spell so whatever
[11/18/16, 11:41:15 AM] <JAILIKESPIE> wutFace

[11/18/16, 11:41:18 AM] <loki_ppl> he forgot advantage
[11/18/16, 11:41:18 AM] <XsweetcheeksX> until something casts dispel magic on their mansion.
[11/18/16, 11:41:22 AM] <Jfeingoldlink> Wow, tech team really all over it!

[11/18/16, 11:41:28 AM] <zeroschneider> Heroism is concentration
[11/18/16, 11:41:32 AM] <asianarcade778> Don't poke the GM with stick... that's a no no

[11/18/16, 11:41:36 AM] <peterthebold> Bidet from bonney lake WA
[11/18/16, 11:41:36 AM] <levi762> @AlwaysAffable Keyleth grappled the one with a spell I think, Grog grappled the other with his arms, Vex shot him, Vax threw daggers and flew around, and cast Heroism on himself and Scanlan
[11/18/16, 11:41:37 AM] <adelulf_degen> i wonder how often they will forget the Advantage on attacks due to grapple
[11/18/16, 11:41:37 AM] <StoryBeforeNumbers> Disadvantage on charisma could actually help make sure the Pit Fiend does not convince the guards in his favor.
[11/18/16, 11:41:38 AM] <KarraChr000> 1+2+2+1?
[11/18/16, 11:41:39 AM] <Gibralter> pitfiend has 300 HP
[11/18/16, 11:41:39 AM] <thedrunkknight42> gandsReally
[11/18/16, 11:41:40 AM] <Darzharm> @theburklepersona If he moves completely to a new plane I assume so but didnt he just stick his head in or something?
[11/18/16, 11:41:40 AM] <bowtiefox> I wish i could scare my players like that
[11/18/16, 11:41:43 AM] <Repdadtar> If they cast dispel magic on the door what happens to percy inside?
[11/18/16, 11:41:46 AM] <nikkitheferret> @Asariel3 :)
