[12/7/16, 11:15:03 AM] <uberbaldy> @Nonfic I didnt say they were seperate but when someone says G&S needs to stop Alpha then that is a miscomprehension about what role G&S has in Alpha.
[12/7/16, 11:15:03 AM] <gilgamesh_prime> alpha is the equivalent of that mobster who sold scanlan the spice
[12/7/16, 11:15:04 AM] <rocha57> even though the show is going to Alpha, there will still be vods at the G&S website, no?
[12/7/16, 11:15:04 AM] <Nightbot> We have a subscriber-only Discord server! Join here: https://t.co/Of0oLClO2v (you'll need to sub and link it to your Twitch) and be a part of the fun!

[12/7/16, 11:15:06 AM] <tracywubsyou> I can never get alpha to work on my phone 😒
[12/7/16, 11:15:06 AM] <Badlangug> this is clear proof that carrot on a stick marketing makes people angry
[12/7/16, 11:15:06 AM] <dizzielizzie570> I can't sign up for alpha

[12/7/16, 11:15:16 AM] <jpcguy89> Say goodbye to Talks Machina everyone!
[12/7/16, 11:15:18 AM] <Edac_plays> Will talks be on YouTube?
[12/7/16, 11:15:19 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> No, Critical Role will stay free because the players are awesome. :)
[12/7/16, 11:15:20 AM] <bipinnate> bye tm. I will miss you on Tuesdays
[12/7/16, 11:15:20 AM] <therookandtheraven> Apparently if you sub to gandsClassic on twitch, you get 6 months of Alpha for free
[12/7/16, 11:15:20 AM] <Jaged1235> @crowley25_17 Bidet from KCMO as well!
[12/7/16, 11:15:21 AM] <jraschen> have they come on yet?
[12/7/16, 11:15:21 AM] <sparkcities> Either pull up a browser without an adblocker or trying turning the adblocker off before you log in to twitch to see if you qualify

[12/7/16, 11:15:24 AM] <Juushwah> Because of grog
[12/7/16, 11:15:26 AM] <AmondinPC> I'm pretty sure literally NO ONE will watch it on Alpha and everyone will unsub from G&S Twitch if Critical Role moves to there, because over 90% of their Twitch subs are because of Critical Role.
[12/7/16, 11:15:30 AM] <NiveusMilitis> @DoctorJangel Old joke from the show.

[12/7/16, 11:15:50 AM] <Critternation3000> @doctorjangel grog said it one time instead of hellow
[12/7/16, 11:15:50 AM] <DoctorJangel> @NiveusMilitis okay thanks
[12/7/16, 11:15:51 AM] <Darkvidel> @Rocha57, no, talks machina will be Alpha only - vods on the alpha site for alpha members. Will not be on youtube nor will it be on the G&S website.

[12/7/16, 11:16:14 AM] <midwest_surfer> bidet was grog's interpretation of "good day" and so all the geeks are overly using the term
[12/7/16, 11:16:16 AM] <Morcant85> Will Larkin be on tonight?
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <MassGenicism> Why are they forcing this on us. Very awkward for the non fake fun people of Vox Machina
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <TheKoopaKhan> alpha is bad and they should feel bad
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <memitim_> @DoctorJangel, it's from critical role, Grog at one point said "bidet" trying to be formal, obviously meaning something like "g'day"
[12/7/16, 11:16:18 AM] <Badlangug> im gonna stay to make twitch great again, then im gonna build a wall around alpha!

[12/7/16, 11:16:59 AM] <deljase> @LucasBlackstone because you vote with your money, and taking money from G&S subs to prop up nerdist contents when a show like CR brought most of the subs... That's shady.

[12/7/16, 11:17:40 AM] <therookandtheraven> My biggest issue with Alpha is that the live stream is buggy. Past broadcasts are fine, but the live stream always freezes for me when I try to AirPlay it to my TV

[12/7/16, 11:17:59 AM] <jpcguy89> It was really stupid for them to have two different URLs, one for beta, and one for when they released.

[12/7/16, 11:18:07 AM] <Graydonsmith> @themonkeyprincess i agree in the same boat
[12/7/16, 11:18:08 AM] <Ziv0> And with alpha you dont ever get to see the rechat of the vods
[12/7/16, 11:18:08 AM] <serenefreak> Dont blame Denise!! She's perfect! She gets this show together always! Blame Matt. I blame Matt.
[12/7/16, 11:18:08 AM] <Karraxx> BACON - VoteYea OR VoteNay
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <deljase> The cast of Critical Role own the rights to the show, and have said time and again they'll not take it behind a paywall.
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <Truealpha1986> I gotta agree. It sucks paying 2 different sites to watch content for 1 show. Please geek and sundry don't let shitty Alpha take talks machina
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <Davidguy> @AzulDrake CR is dualstreamed to both alpha and twitch
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <buttassbooty> DENISE WAS GETTING MAD AT FOSTER SO SHE SABOTAGED THE SHOW

[12/7/16, 11:18:26 AM] <Pesmerga2007> I would hate to be in charge of Alpha's PR dept. Try to put those fires out. I dare you.
[12/7/16, 11:18:26 AM] <kr15t0ph3rk3nn3dy> So starting from a few weeks will CritRole not be on twitch anymore? only Alpha?

[12/7/16, 11:18:29 AM] <Davidguy> THIS WILL BE THE LAST EPISODE OF TALKS MACHINA ON TWITCH BEFORE IT BECOMES EXCLUSIVE TO ALPHA ONLY. UNLESS THEY'VE STATED OTHERWISE, BUT THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US MODS ANYTHING
[12/7/16, 11:18:29 AM] <lucifermoloch> VoteYea
[12/7/16, 11:18:31 AM] <3stroy> Vox Machina are going to TPK on purpose and then the show will move to Alpha only

[12/7/16, 11:18:43 AM] <rjhallett> @Lpsneaky NW Indiana, Michigan City
[12/7/16, 11:18:43 AM] <Darkvidel> @PreRambus, the CR cast said that the only way they could do such a talkshow format was with alpha, so they would prefer to have it free (like cr) and available for everyone but that';s not possible. They fought to keep cr free and thus there is only an "enhanced" version or cr on alpha
[12/7/16, 11:18:45 AM] <mayhemtoolkit> Are there viewer / subscriber counters on Alpha?
[12/7/16, 11:18:46 AM] <BaconFantasy> @Karraxx Umm...
