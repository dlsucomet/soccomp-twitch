[12/7/16, 11:16:14 AM] <midwest_surfer> bidet was grog's interpretation of "good day" and so all the geeks are overly using the term
[12/7/16, 11:16:16 AM] <Morcant85> Will Larkin be on tonight?
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <MassGenicism> Why are they forcing this on us. Very awkward for the non fake fun people of Vox Machina
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <TheKoopaKhan> alpha is bad and they should feel bad
[12/7/16, 11:16:17 AM] <memitim_> @DoctorJangel, it's from critical role, Grog at one point said "bidet" trying to be formal, obviously meaning something like "g'day"
[12/7/16, 11:16:18 AM] <Badlangug> im gonna stay to make twitch great again, then im gonna build a wall around alpha!

[12/7/16, 11:16:59 AM] <deljase> @LucasBlackstone because you vote with your money, and taking money from G&S subs to prop up nerdist contents when a show like CR brought most of the subs... That's shady.
[12/7/16, 11:17:00 AM] <Morbid687> my god is alpha slow AF

[12/7/16, 11:17:14 AM] <SlayerKast> Talks Machina was delayed due to Game the Game running over, reign your dragons in.
[12/7/16, 11:17:15 AM] <PreRambus> @Davidguy, do you know if there's a specific reason why it'll be only streamed on alpha? because i think twitch got a far bigger range viewerwise :o
[12/7/16, 11:17:15 AM] <chaosmorning> I really hope they talk *** about Alpha like they did last week.
[12/7/16, 11:17:17 AM] <Redvine89> Thank you Lord Mercer for the update :)

[12/7/16, 11:17:40 AM] <therookandtheraven> My biggest issue with Alpha is that the live stream is buggy. Past broadcasts are fine, but the live stream always freezes for me when I try to AirPlay it to my TV
[12/7/16, 11:17:41 AM] <mrobin5> @PreRambus Cuz Legendary wants your money

[12/7/16, 11:17:49 AM] <shadow_284> They said on twitter "big announcement tonight". Maybe no switch to Alpha? Or a new live episode of CR?
[12/7/16, 11:17:49 AM] <uberbaldy> @midwest_surfer It is NOT just you
[12/7/16, 11:17:53 AM] <disposabIe> wait... critrole is moving?
[12/7/16, 11:17:53 AM] <mrvrodwpg> It's a shame, I love the show but I'm not subbing to alpha for one show.

[12/7/16, 11:17:56 AM] <hazard_mtg> i sub to support G&S=== ALPHA: "Here sub with us too so we can steal business and reap the work you already did."
[12/7/16, 11:17:57 AM] <LemonWade> Why do i still have a 3 month badge? ive been subber over a year
[12/7/16, 11:17:57 AM] <zathyr> The start time is really more of a general guideline
[12/7/16, 11:17:58 AM] <FancyMcNurse> like the apple store is almost clsed guys
[12/7/16, 11:17:59 AM] <jpcguy89> It was really stupid for them to have two different URLs, one for beta, and one for when they released.

[12/7/16, 11:18:01 AM] <sparrow015> @productighoul good choice. I'll be making my beer fridge when the winds die down.
[12/7/16, 11:18:01 AM] <therookandtheraven> And there's no Alpha app so i'm stuck airplaying from my browser
[12/7/16, 11:18:03 AM] <deerslayer4390> so the last episode is going to be like 10 minutes.....
[12/7/16, 11:18:03 AM] <TyrionStrongjaw> @Evion223, The crew was just on a Puzzle Quest Game the Game so it'll be a little bit later than normal

[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <deljase> The cast of Critical Role own the rights to the show, and have said time and again they'll not take it behind a paywall.
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <Truealpha1986> I gotta agree. It sucks paying 2 different sites to watch content for 1 show. Please geek and sundry don't let shitty Alpha take talks machina
[12/7/16, 11:18:09 AM] <Davidguy> @AzulDrake CR is dualstreamed to both alpha and twitch

[12/7/16, 11:18:43 AM] <Darkvidel> @PreRambus, the CR cast said that the only way they could do such a talkshow format was with alpha, so they would prefer to have it free (like cr) and available for everyone but that';s not possible. They fought to keep cr free and thus there is only an "enhanced" version or cr on alpha
[12/7/16, 11:18:45 AM] <mayhemtoolkit> Are there viewer / subscriber counters on Alpha?
