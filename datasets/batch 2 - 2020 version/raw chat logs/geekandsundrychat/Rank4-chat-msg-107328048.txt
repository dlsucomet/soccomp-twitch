It wasn't saying it was ok, but yes, when you're exciting about something and it doesn't go the way you want some people harness that excitement to the negative. Not saying it's ok. Just that it happens.

[12/14/16, 11:24:52 AM] <serethwynters> Its my question!
[12/14/16, 11:24:53 AM] <the_duganator8> Alpha: ruining things since the second some fuckwit came up with the idea.
[12/14/16, 11:24:53 AM] <botchbrother> oh I am very interested in these questions
[12/14/16, 11:24:56 AM] <vintaren> Is anyone else's volume low??
[12/14/16, 11:24:59 AM] <Fractaleye> so, in January, will Alpha not crash and be off-line as much?

[12/14/16, 11:25:05 AM] <Laboons_beard> Schway
[12/14/16, 11:25:06 AM] <Lisseas> yeah, to be fair, people complained they weren't going to get tm at all and now that it will continue to be free they're upset that they threw alpha a bone or two to make it happen?
[12/14/16, 11:25:07 AM] <Fenrisudo> I cant even sub on Twitch, so sad.... BibleThump
[12/14/16, 11:25:07 AM] <ecadolt> Because subing to this channel isn't worth it any more apparently.
[12/14/16, 11:25:07 AM] <BrianWFoster> Is the sound cutting out for you guys too?
[12/14/16, 11:25:09 AM] <keiawyn> Not gonna lie, I totally thought Mary was actually British for the longest time.

[12/14/16, 11:26:29 AM] <moderntowel> can alpha enhance the camera angles being used?
[12/14/16, 11:26:30 AM] <Slippydude> the lighting on that Pike Painting TT_TT
[12/14/16, 11:26:31 AM] <my_moms_tits> No way, he's from Boy meets world aha
[12/14/16, 11:26:33 AM] <trueformunseen> Wow that pic of pike is menacing
[12/14/16, 11:26:34 AM] <Fractaleye> yeah, I can hear it fine, it's just I have my volume on max, and it should be way louder than it is
[12/14/16, 11:26:36 AM] <buttassbooty> GRRM is Wil
[12/14/16, 11:26:37 AM] <DarthTorLin> restart your broswer if you lost sound

[12/14/16, 11:26:46 AM] <Kissmyfineass> every other time it freezes, the sound either comes back or goes away
[12/14/16, 11:26:54 AM] <Juushwah> I loved Felicia's character
[12/14/16, 11:26:58 AM] <Paul_Lynde> Sound is only for Alpha
[12/14/16, 11:26:58 AM] <Ductaper> OMG that pike image in the back is NOT agreeing with the camera and lighting
[12/14/16, 11:26:59 AM] <bubbapuddles> love both of them! :D
