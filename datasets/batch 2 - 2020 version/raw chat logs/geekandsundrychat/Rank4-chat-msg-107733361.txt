[12/16/16, 10:37:17 AM] <KnighthoodX> Enter1: Thordak dies and everyone lives2. Thordak dies and at least 1 character is permadead3. Thordak is not slain or gets away this episode
[12/16/16, 10:37:19 AM] <JasonSriracha> Thing about Dracolichs is that theyre weaker than Ancient red dragons... And to a group of level 13-15s, an ancient red dragon is nothing. This leads me to believe that matt has simply buffed Thordak immensely. But i guess we'll see.

[12/16/16, 10:41:27 AM] <Nightbot> The rebroadcast is sometimes played using Twitch's playlist feature. It basically works like Youtube playlists where it will just play a series of queued videos on a loop. The channel won't appear as being online when using the playlist and there is no way to schedule when certain VODs will play, it just goes straight from one VOD to the next. The playlist doesn't work on some devices, so try switching to something else if your current device isn't working with it.
