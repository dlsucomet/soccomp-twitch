[12/21/16, 11:58:01 AM] <doctorwhoots> what's this wallet thing about
[12/21/16, 11:58:07 AM] <Chovexani> *cries* I have no European friends to send me chocolate
[12/21/16, 11:58:08 AM] <Mattitudinal> I hear chocolate from Finland is easy to Finnish. >_>
[12/21/16, 11:58:08 AM] <sorcpenz> Why so much spam when things go wrong?
[12/21/16, 11:58:10 AM] <mechagundamalpha01> Taliesin is wearing the skeleton outfit from David Pumpkins sketch? @brianwfoster
[12/21/16, 11:58:11 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @CheshireMadd, he'd probably keep them tbh, I mean, did you see the video where he did the tour of where he lives?
[12/21/16, 11:58:14 AM] <DIEnHARNESS> Finland chocolate, a little depression in every bar.

[12/21/16, 11:59:01 AM] <keiawyn> Is Matt left-handed? Doesn't a watch usually go on the non-dominant wrist? (not that I suppose it's a rule . . .)
[12/21/16, 11:59:01 AM] <CheshireMadd> @SpeedDemonStar There's a video tour of where he lives? And I'd fully expect him to keep them, to be honest

[12/21/16, 11:59:06 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @Chovexani, even if you did, shipping between countries is outrageously expensive

[12/21/16, 11:59:21 AM] <mechagundamalpha01> @keiawyn no idea.
[12/21/16, 11:59:22 AM] <pinemphl275> Can't talk to dead if the dead has no head. A dragon head can be a hostage, specially if Pike talks to him first.
