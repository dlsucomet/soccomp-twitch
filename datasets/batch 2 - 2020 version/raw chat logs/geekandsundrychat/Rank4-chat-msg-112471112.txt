[01/6/17, 10:58:22 AM] <LEReslow> Most episodes, I'm fairly confident that VM can take the day. but what Vax did at the end of last episode was incredibly stupid. Going straight into a fight with Raishan was an incredibly bad idea driven by Vax's love for Keyleth and I think there is a real possibility it might get them all killed.
[01/6/17, 10:58:22 AM] <cordialfiber> oh my god, its finally happening!
