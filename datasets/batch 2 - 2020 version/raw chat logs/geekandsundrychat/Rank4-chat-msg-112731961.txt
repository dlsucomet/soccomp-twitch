[01/7/17, 4:09:03 AM] <Lowe505> Time's? Obito_13
[01/7/17, 4:09:28 AM] <starpilotsix> Too bad the RPG didn't come in a boxed set, then you could call the show "Mad Man With a Boxed Set"
[01/7/17, 4:09:29 AM] <LeahcimtheLearned> Tennant! :)
[01/7/17, 4:09:34 AM] <Splattercatt> Darin is actually a Time Lord too. Little known fact. :P
[01/7/17, 4:09:34 AM] <Marshal_Matt> Capaldi's great
[01/7/17, 4:09:37 AM] <theloopyjayne> Malcolm Tucker! (anyone get the reference)
[01/7/17, 4:09:42 AM] <1opinionated> So excited to see this. I'm trying to get a friend into TTRPGs but he doesn't dig D&D but loves Doctor Who.
[01/7/17, 4:09:45 AM] <Critternation3000> I really enjoy Eric went all out today
[01/7/17, 4:09:45 AM] <Obito_13> @Lowe505 Rebroadcasts don't have set times, you'll just have to tune in and look at the schedule to see what is playing in order

[01/7/17, 4:10:09 AM] <Psilio> i didn't even know there was a game
[01/7/17, 4:10:29 AM] <Nemisar> They are so cool!
[01/7/17, 4:10:29 AM] <JJ_Dane> No die, just coin toss
[01/7/17, 4:10:30 AM] <Lyra33Vega> o3o" I'm gonna have no idea what is going on here. *doesn't watch Doctor Who*
[01/7/17, 4:10:34 AM] <Marshal_Matt> Seek! Locate! Destroy!
[01/7/17, 4:10:52 AM] <darkmoonrise312> Who made this game?
[01/7/17, 4:10:55 AM] <theloopyjayne> I have K9 in my room.
[01/7/17, 4:10:56 AM] <Critternation3000> @psilio I'm pretty sure that there's a game for everything
[01/7/17, 4:11:00 AM] <PolythenePamster> !wtfisthis
[01/7/17, 4:11:01 AM] <Nightbot> This is Eric's TBD RPG! Take a ride in the TARDIS with Eric and the gang as they play the DoctorWho RPG by Cubicle 7!
[01/7/17, 4:11:03 AM] <theloopyjayne> Cubicle 7 made the game!
[01/7/17, 4:11:07 AM] <Marshal_Matt> Come to think of it, Daleks say the same thing twice "Seek, Locate"
[01/7/17, 4:11:07 AM] <LeahcimtheLearned> Yup!
[01/7/17, 4:11:13 AM] <DragonSparkz> I started with Baker too!
[01/7/17, 4:11:18 AM] <darkmoonrise312> thanks
[01/7/17, 4:11:24 AM] <Psilio> probably, @Critternation3000 :)
[01/7/17, 4:11:38 AM] <Nemisar> If Darin want to tell stories, everything has to STOP and LISTEN! :P
[01/7/17, 4:11:40 AM] <theloopyjayne> I started with Baker, it was before it came back on TV but it was reruns.
[01/7/17, 4:11:43 AM] <postdataest> rebroadcast playlist is not set until s9omeone makes after the end of show tonight 30+ hors os the weeks show into the 60+ hours before the channel goes live Monday CR times will be estimated once the playlist begins @Lowe505
[01/7/17, 4:11:50 AM] <Marshal_Matt> And he was better than Moffat!
[01/7/17, 4:11:53 AM] <PolythenePamster> sub HYPE <3 <3
[01/7/17, 4:11:55 AM] <Critternation3000> @womstv agreed
[01/7/17, 4:11:56 AM] <Zismarith> Ooooohhhh.
[01/7/17, 4:12:03 AM] <Chovexani> heeheeehee
[01/7/17, 4:12:04 AM] <lucentheart> Skills
[01/7/17, 4:12:05 AM] <starpilotsix> I think I first saw Baker when I was a little kid but didn't understand it then in the 90s we had a SF channel that started playing the really early episodes and I caught some early Troughton and he became my first "real" Doctor.
[01/7/17, 4:12:06 AM] <Psilio> a who, now?
[01/7/17, 4:12:10 AM] <Mousegsm> pun count 1
[01/7/17, 4:12:18 AM] <Psilio> sorry...
[01/7/17, 4:12:21 AM] <Chovexani> Torchwood was good
[01/7/17, 4:12:32 AM] <theloopyjayne> Torchwood S3 is the best.
[01/7/17, 4:12:35 AM] <Chovexani> heh if the name of my parrot wasn't a hint that i was a fan
[01/7/17, 4:12:38 AM] <Splattercatt> I also have the Captain Jack coat. Also a very great coat. :D
[01/7/17, 4:12:40 AM] <PolythenePamster> I liked Torchwood the last season not so much
[01/7/17, 4:12:43 AM] <Marshal_Matt> I didn't realise Dr Who was so popular in the USA
[01/7/17, 4:12:46 AM] <Lyra33Vega> Um... Baker?
[01/7/17, 4:12:48 AM] <Nemisar> I love John Barrowman
[01/7/17, 4:13:00 AM] <darkmoonrise312> Captain Jack was awesome
[01/7/17, 4:13:05 AM] <theloopyjayne> *raises fist* BARROWMAN!
[01/7/17, 4:13:07 AM] <Psilio> never seen Torchwood. thanks for the tip
[01/7/17, 4:13:09 AM] <Marshal_Matt> Eeeeew
[01/7/17, 4:13:26 AM] <Marshal_Matt> Looks like a visit from Captain Jack Harkness
[01/7/17, 4:13:32 AM] <starpilotsix> @Lyra33Vega One of the actors who played the Doctor. Actually, there were two, Tom Baker and Colin Baker, but most people mean Tom.
[01/7/17, 4:13:35 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @Marshal_Mortier He really was. After Tennant left, I was not a fan of what I refer to as the "Moffat" era
[01/7/17, 4:13:38 AM] <KnighthoodX> have to drop, everyone enjoy and have fun!
[01/7/17, 4:13:56 AM] <Splattercatt> Take care @KnighthoodX :)
[01/7/17, 4:14:20 AM] <Psilio> I are pissed! :P
[01/7/17, 4:14:22 AM] <Lyra33Vega> @starpilotsix Oh! Tom played the one with the scarf, yeah? Which one did Colin play?
[01/7/17, 4:14:25 AM] <Psilio> sorry again...
[01/7/17, 4:14:25 AM] <lucentheart> bye bye
[01/7/17, 4:14:26 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @KnighthoodX Later
[01/7/17, 4:14:37 AM] <darkmoonrise312> As you awake, you realise you have been eaten
[01/7/17, 4:14:39 AM] <starpilotsix> @Lyra33Vega Yes. Colin played the one with the wild rainbow coat.

[01/7/17, 4:14:58 AM] <Marshal_Matt> @Ricky_Galletti Couldn't agree more, wasn't a big fan of Smith much as the Dr either, I love Capaldi but I think the often bad writing lets him and the show down
[01/7/17, 4:14:59 AM] <Mousegsm> @lyra33vega blond curls with Ace
[01/7/17, 4:15:00 AM] <theloopyjayne> Colin Baker had a serious case of injustice with the BBC and Michael Grade.
