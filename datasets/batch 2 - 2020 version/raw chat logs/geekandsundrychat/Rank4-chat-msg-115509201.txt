[01/18/17, 10:34:31 AM] <masterjj1162> THANK you all for the advice.
[01/18/17, 10:34:48 AM] <TheFootKnight> <3 That's what DM's are for.
[01/18/17, 10:34:48 AM] <Atealein> swiftfingers : no worries :D
[01/18/17, 10:34:50 AM] <masterjj1162> i think im gonna go without armor with a shield
[01/18/17, 10:35:00 AM] <MC_Thanks> @corksy123 2 days from now, in 30 minutes or check out wheniscriticalrole . com
[01/18/17, 10:35:08 AM] <Atealein> Masterjj1162 : it depends what weapon you will get
[01/18/17, 10:35:09 AM] <starpilotsix> If you're still seeing the schedule you might want to refresh, the wait screen is up.
[01/18/17, 10:35:14 AM] <Immortal_Blank> And if you have more question ask people you play with and/or your DM
[01/18/17, 10:35:23 AM] <Cardamonelaw> Evening chat.:D
[01/18/17, 10:35:23 AM] <edwardwcross> me think they are gonna need to redesign the set because of all the cool critmas stuff
[01/18/17, 10:35:24 AM] <swiftfingers> Bern is majorly Swiss german, so I'd go on Roll20 if I were you
[01/18/17, 10:35:24 AM] <corksy123> @MC_Thanks thank you :)
[01/18/17, 10:35:28 AM] <Truedodger> wheniscriticalrole.com
[01/18/17, 10:35:42 AM] <Atealein> Masterjj1162 : if your group finds a cool two-handed weapon, you should really drop the shield and go for it, a barbarian can really use a lot of advantages with strength-based weapon
[01/18/17, 10:35:53 AM] <davedp3> first lol
[01/18/17, 10:35:56 AM] <masterjj1162> true, the dm was gonna let us pick basic starting weapons. im just worried with all the spell casters. im the only melee. and i MUST tank everything

[01/18/17, 10:35:58 AM] <RevloBot> Channel offline. No longer tracking points
[01/18/17, 10:36:02 AM] <Rogue_13> and you can always ask here, 95% of the time there's someone who plays or DMs - though response can be a little slow off-hours
[01/18/17, 10:36:03 AM] <edwardwcross> I mean just look at Grog
[01/18/17, 10:36:10 AM] <zaltoe> I haven't played D&D since the 80s but watching Critical Role has made me want to play again
[01/18/17, 10:36:17 AM] <MC_Thanks> Question, has anyone ever played as an amnesic character in D&D?
[01/18/17, 10:36:20 AM] <TheFootKnight> Up to you really. Don't try to min max everything and just have fun.
[01/18/17, 10:36:30 AM] <Atealein> Masterjj1162 : if it is normal equipment, go with one-handed weapon and shield
[01/18/17, 10:36:40 AM] <Immortal_Blank> MC I have and it was a great time
[01/18/17, 10:36:46 AM] <Onikaton123> I love the plea for help lol
[01/18/17, 10:36:47 AM] <edwardwcross> If travis would ever get his AC to 20 he would enter altered beast mode, but the character is just an endless well of HP
[01/18/17, 10:36:53 AM] <balthir66> I just got Fantasy Grounds and am really wanting to play
[01/18/17, 10:36:58 AM] <RevloBot> geekandsundry is online. RevloBot is now tracking loyalty.
[01/18/17, 10:36:58 AM] <masterjj1162> agreed.. ive always tanked in mmos, so i figured id be confy trying it first.. but tis weird that im the only melee.. lol
[01/18/17, 10:36:59 AM] <BaconFantasy> This feels like ghost vision. We're all just ghost haunting the G&S set. gandsSpoopy
[01/18/17, 10:37:13 AM] <murasaur> in dungeons and dragons home games, you don't have to play the "meta"
[01/18/17, 10:37:15 AM] <davedp3> which one do you think is denise
[01/18/17, 10:37:21 AM] <edwardwcross> that's true you can never really go wrong with sword and board
[01/18/17, 10:37:23 AM] <Galvanator> Dont spook me Bacon
[01/18/17, 10:37:27 AM] <angrylilith1926> right?!

[01/18/17, 10:37:35 AM] <DextrousSlime> I like that sign. "Brian will not let me leave... Please send help"
[01/18/17, 10:37:38 AM] <Sithy_Penguin> all of my yay

[01/18/17, 10:37:47 AM] <Atealein> Masterjj1162 : I am currently playing Eagle Totem Barbarian that started out exactly like that.. but like two sessions into the group (I was joining a party mid-adventure, as one of their previous players dropped and they were looking for new faces) they handed me off a really cool greatsword nobody else was using becaus they were all squishy dex-based guys or ranged attackers.
[01/18/17, 10:37:54 AM] <rippage91> dat *** doe
[01/18/17, 10:37:55 AM] <edwardwcross> but when I think barbarian I think Conan, Arnie version
[01/18/17, 10:37:56 AM] <TheFootKnight> Well, remember that tanking in D&D isn't like other game, specifically MMO's. Any smart enemy will go after the others.
[01/18/17, 10:38:05 AM] <jpcguy89> Sweet! My post in /r/lfg got a bunch of replies!
[01/18/17, 10:38:13 AM] <jpcguy89> I know have a few more potential DMs.
[01/18/17, 10:38:16 AM] <jpcguy89> now*
[01/18/17, 10:38:16 AM] <Atealein> Masterjj1162 : So I changed the shield and battleaxe for that.
[01/18/17, 10:38:19 AM] <MC_Thanks> Haha, I just noticed that sign. I wish there were more 'times' like this, get to see behind the magic

[01/18/17, 10:38:48 AM] <Rogue_13> Masterjj1162 - mid-term consideration - look into using polearm and sentinel feat (extended reach and opportunity attacks freeze the opponent) if you are the only melee, will help you control things
[01/18/17, 10:38:48 AM] <Chaosthe> was that Denise?
[01/18/17, 10:38:50 AM] <jpcguy89> "Brian will not let me leave. Please send help!"

[01/18/17, 10:39:35 AM] <masterjj1162> true, but i figured since i was the only melee i would always be in the middle of everything. and my only goals is to not die. lol but i also no i would kill everything alot faster with 2hander. just dont know how squishy id be with a 2hander early

[01/18/17, 10:39:57 AM] <masterjj1162> i seen that too but bear totem seems hard to pass up
[01/18/17, 10:40:04 AM] <edwardwcross> as a bard you are naturally not squishy
[01/18/17, 10:40:08 AM] <eyelessmike1> when did this start??
[01/18/17, 10:40:09 AM] <TheFootKnight> Bear totem is amazing.
[01/18/17, 10:40:10 AM] <edwardwcross> barb
[01/18/17, 10:40:11 AM] <BaconFantasy> What if Denise is stuck inside a printer, that's where we're getting all these signs from!?

[01/18/17, 10:40:20 AM] <khornite> LOL someone needs help.
[01/18/17, 10:40:23 AM] <Escaho> oh man, every time Brian says "Denise!" all I can think of is Starkid's "Airport for Birds" skits with Denise Donovan
[01/18/17, 10:40:25 AM] <thumper_tx> Was that matt wiping the table?
[01/18/17, 10:40:29 AM] <edwardwcross> bear totem makes you literally a tank
[01/18/17, 10:40:29 AM] <spectre_sore> Bear Totem is best Totem
[01/18/17, 10:40:30 AM] <swiftfingers> @MC_Thanks, never tried that, but my next character is going to be a puppeteer bard who mostly speaks through his puppet which is chaotic evil, while he's lawfull good
[01/18/17, 10:40:35 AM] <DashingCardigan> Denise's brother is Denephew

[01/18/17, 10:40:54 AM] <Vile_> Is that Liam or Travis on the couch?
[01/18/17, 10:40:55 AM] <TheFootKnight> Alright, then listen to the people talking about feats and such. Sentinel is fantastic. Shield Master would be great if using a shield and sticking to one.
[01/18/17, 10:40:56 AM] <Valmere> liam lol
[01/18/17, 10:40:56 AM] <tko552> level 6 total

[01/18/17, 10:41:07 AM] <Vile_> Ah, can tell now.
[01/18/17, 10:41:09 AM] <swiftfingers> and if any of you guys like that idea, feel free to use it
[01/18/17, 10:41:10 AM] <MC_Thanks> @swiftfingers that sounds great, those the puppet get it's own sheet?
[01/18/17, 10:41:10 AM] <jpcguy89> I always feel a bit like a show off as a Wizard. My Fireball just decimates enemies and my party mates have trouble dealing damage to one guy. But when I run out of higher level slots, which is really quick, it's "firebolt", "....uhhh...firebolt", "*sigh* firebolt"
[01/18/17, 10:41:16 AM] <edwardwcross> like the character from batman...the ganster puppet guy

[01/18/17, 10:42:53 AM] <swiftfingers> @MC_Thanks, if the DM allows it yes, otherwise I'll work it into the main character sheet, but seriously, I can't think of any DM who wouldn't have a blast and allow it

[01/18/17, 10:43:02 AM] <TirieHoneyblue> @Spectre_sore Love that feat...Now if only my DM would stop using AE and start using single target spells :D
