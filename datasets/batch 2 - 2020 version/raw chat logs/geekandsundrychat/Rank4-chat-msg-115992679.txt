[01/20/17, 10:32:52 AM] <Flight_Devil> @Sev_Bentley Not necessarily. If pike gets taken out first, they die. You also have to take into account how powerful they are. Realistically speaking, a group such as VM wouldn't really fall that easily.
[01/20/17, 10:32:57 AM] <astrozombiephotography> Woo

[01/20/17, 10:33:05 AM] <Flight_Devil> @Sev_Bentley If they DO die, it's either due to bad luck or lack of preparation.

[01/20/17, 10:33:11 AM] <Dragonchrome> Hi @JC_Wijma
[01/20/17, 10:33:14 AM] <raijunkain> so if we're down a sam, does that mean it's up to laura to bring the comedy to the ad read?
[01/20/17, 10:33:15 AM] <fantasyfreakvi> Wait, so, we'll actually get to see Patrick in a fight for once?
[01/20/17, 10:33:16 AM] <Vance1982> although I find the lack of Asamir twin artwork disappointing

[01/20/17, 10:35:31 AM] <Sev_Bentley> @Flightdevil that's a good point. I think pike is a bit cheating though. Don't get me wrong, I love her, but Ashley is gone a lot and I doubt they'll kill pike is ashley isnt there, so to me it just seems like they're off-handed playing a cleric to heal/rez themselves
