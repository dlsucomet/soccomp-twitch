[02/8/17, 10:41:03 AM] <RedFinch> @BrianWFoster What if I told you, Glenn is your twin?
[02/8/17, 10:41:13 AM] <Critternation3000> @brianwfoster are u worried that you made @denisebrr too powerful? ?
[02/8/17, 10:41:13 AM] <sandbagger3> Is that Denise behind the chairs on the right?
[02/8/17, 10:41:15 AM] <Chovexani> Vodka is water in russian ;3
[02/8/17, 10:41:18 AM] <Vikthoria> who's it today?

[02/8/17, 10:41:27 AM] <Arborhawk> @BrianWFoster is your D&D game a weekly game?
[02/8/17, 10:41:31 AM] <purpledragon_jon> I imagine a line on the floor that Denise is not allowed to cross
[02/8/17, 10:41:34 AM] <AedenEamerin> Um, is there no sound or is it just me? o_o
[02/8/17, 10:41:40 AM] <Critternation3000> @sandbagger3 no its Amandine
[02/8/17, 10:41:45 AM] <wanderingace> Denise is right there in plain sight....She trained in the most secret of ninja academies after all.
[02/8/17, 10:41:45 AM] <jmaroni> same
[02/8/17, 10:41:49 AM] <Vikthoria> no sounds
[02/8/17, 10:41:49 AM] <Rogue_13> if Denise is artificial she will comply with one of 2 laws - she will either be obsolete in 5 year, or double in power in 1 ...
[02/8/17, 10:41:50 AM] <sandbagger3> Thank you
[02/8/17, 10:41:52 AM] <cratzlaff2> no sound for me

[02/8/17, 10:42:00 AM] <Ragespaz> @BrianWFoster, the moment SNL was talking about Glen in the Spicer sketch, I immediately thought of you and if you approved of that or not

[02/8/17, 10:42:13 AM] <hungryhalfling> there is no sound. Although, some of those lovely Donkey Kong Country remixes from a couple of weeks ago would be totally clutch... please
