[02/23/17, 4:15:07 AM] <TommyHobo> Seduction of the Innocent seems like bad Twilight Fan Fic
[02/23/17, 4:15:09 AM] <ActualSwampWitch> I feel like polygon made a yt video on that
[02/23/17, 4:15:09 AM] <JJ_Dane> "Seduction of the Innocent"
[02/23/17, 4:15:19 AM] <GeekandSundry> Amy smiling at a comics-nerding Matt Key is my new favorite shot
[02/23/17, 4:15:21 AM] <Saltypikkles> Hey guysh
[02/23/17, 4:15:23 AM] <fishbreath49> STICKERS!
[02/23/17, 4:15:24 AM] <chaoticloony> Remember that anyone that plays D&D worships Satan!
[02/23/17, 4:15:31 AM] <jrobie_1970> @TommyHobo So 50 Shades of Grey?

[02/23/17, 4:15:32 AM] <Quaraxkad1> tempuslibris sounds like you don't need any recommendations, you're doin' just fine!
[02/23/17, 4:15:41 AM] <BiancaTX> I had no idea that's what the COMICS CODE came from, that's crazy!
[02/23/17, 4:15:49 AM] <wakiki067> Great show, will be on my regenerate show list
[02/23/17, 4:15:51 AM] <101deadpool1017> Comics, D&D, metal and rap. All were considered bad for kids.
[02/23/17, 4:15:58 AM] <MikeeThePrude> Amy smiling is the best thing!

[02/23/17, 4:16:15 AM] <signifiedo> Can they all do the comic book guy voice? Just to see if they measure up, and get it out of the way?
[02/23/17, 4:16:19 AM] <TommyHobo> @jrobie_1970 No, that's really bad Twilight Fan Fic. Seduction of The Inocent just seems very shirtless focussed
[02/23/17, 4:16:22 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub gandsSubHype
[02/23/17, 4:16:26 AM] <GoodWeird> comics are evil. also rock and roll. also games. also books. also tv. also life
[02/23/17, 4:16:31 AM] <Critternation3000> @geekandsundry can use revlo for this show?
[02/23/17, 4:16:32 AM] <Quaraxkad1> tempuslibris how about Sword, Girls, Alex + Ada, all three by the same Luna brothers

[02/23/17, 4:16:52 AM] <JJ_Dane> "Suggested for mature readers" was the first nail in the coffin
[02/23/17, 4:16:57 AM] <MikeeThePrude> :D
[02/23/17, 4:16:58 AM] <WordMan> I love NIghtcrawler
[02/23/17, 4:16:59 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> In terms of the big two...Marvel dropped the comics code first, then a few years later DC finally drop it which I believe they were the very last company to drop the code thus killing it completetly
[02/23/17, 4:17:00 AM] <JRFanboyOG> LOOK AT AMY she loves this story
[02/23/17, 4:17:02 AM] <GeekandSundry> No revlo donations today @Critternation3000 not until we get our feet o nth eground
[02/23/17, 4:17:03 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> Nightcrawler is my favorite. <3
[02/23/17, 4:17:04 AM] <TommyHobo> You would have thought Banshee was more likely to be a Catholic Comic gateway drug
[02/23/17, 4:17:26 AM] <ErikaIshii> That's such a cool origin!
