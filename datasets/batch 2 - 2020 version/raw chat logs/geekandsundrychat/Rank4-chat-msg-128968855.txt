[03/16/17, 6:17:56 AM] <justjohnforever> Yay!
[03/16/17, 6:18:02 AM] <OCDDavid> yeah i am rewatching pugmire atm to look for a one eyed dog because of jimmy in the modern alpha but not alpha pre werewolf episode because at first i thought it was a nod but more recently they have featured full blown characters from pugmire so the thanatos computer/program must be reusing either people or npc scripts from pugmire in current adventures and i am wondering how jimmy the potentially programmer or at least some kind of scientist might have fit into pugmire
[03/16/17, 6:18:19 AM] <CarolineTheGeek> Congrats on the album and happy belated birthday Amy!
[03/16/17, 6:18:30 AM] <chaoticloony> How can anyone not love JCM and Amy songs!
