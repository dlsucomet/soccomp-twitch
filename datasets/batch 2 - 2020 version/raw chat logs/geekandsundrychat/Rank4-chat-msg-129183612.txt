[03/17/17, 9:48:47 AM] <Br0nc0B1lly405> I wish that Critical Role was an Anime Series. I would watch that in a heartbeat.

[03/17/17, 9:48:53 AM] <Kronkality> @Wrextasy, I don't know... He seemed to skip damage rolls he should have been doing... FOr example, the second time Grog was swallowed, he never took the acid damage he should have taken, which would have knocked him out inside of it, along with Vax
