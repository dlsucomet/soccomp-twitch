[03/23/17, 3:05:36 AM] <japenrose> @sorcpenz I've definitely stumbled across some horror manga!
[03/23/17, 3:05:41 AM] <JodyHouser> Poop comes when it well. And this conversation is already in the toilet. :p
[03/23/17, 3:05:42 AM] <JJ_Dane> It killed them, basically
[03/23/17, 3:05:44 AM] <Triamas> pushing the envelope can be creepy
[03/23/17, 3:05:47 AM] <WednesdaySnow> Crypt Keeper was great
[03/23/17, 3:05:56 AM] <sorcpenz> QUESTION: What would you recommend for Japanese horror comics?
[03/23/17, 3:05:56 AM] <japenrose> @sorcpenz My dad LOVES Creature from the Black Lagoon, so I think Swamp Thing would be great for him
[03/23/17, 3:06:03 AM] <Zenora1911> gandsSubHype gandsSubHype gandsSubHype gandsSubHype gandsSubHype gandsSubHype
[03/23/17, 3:06:08 AM] <starpilotsix> The comic code was specifically designed to kill horror comics, they made rules specifically to kill certain titles by banning those words in the title.
[03/23/17, 3:06:19 AM] <JodyHouser> Attack on Titan I'd classify as horror and it's the biggest title in manga right now.
[03/23/17, 3:06:26 AM] <primax104> Hey Guys
[03/23/17, 3:06:37 AM] <Critternation3000> @jodyhouser hey jody
[03/23/17, 3:06:40 AM] <sorcpenz> @JodyHouser love attack on titan
[03/23/17, 3:06:51 AM] <Bitgod> yay degenerates!
[03/23/17, 3:06:56 AM] <Nightbot> 101deadpool1017 -> Come get some! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[03/23/17, 3:07:03 AM] <sorcpenz> @japenrose what japanese horror would you recommend? I love psychological stuff
[03/23/17, 3:07:10 AM] <Greentv23> Taliesin gandsLessthanthree gandsLessthanthree
[03/23/17, 3:07:14 AM] <JSMitchell> Relating to both the code and Bernie Wrightson, I remember him telling a story of them trying to come down on Swamp Thing because he was 'undraped'
[03/23/17, 3:07:19 AM] <snappywizard> Is the comic code still in effect to some extent? Or are there any lingering effects of it?
[03/23/17, 3:07:23 AM] <Critternation3000> hi amy Taliesin and matt
[03/23/17, 3:07:26 AM] <cardinaliron> And like most regulated organizations over-reached and affected non-horror comics too.
[03/23/17, 3:07:35 AM] <101deadpool1017> Wednesday Club Assemble !
[03/23/17, 3:07:46 AM] <JodyHouser> For really good horror manga, look up Junji Ito.
[03/23/17, 3:08:06 AM] <japenrose> @sorcpenz I agree with Jodie Houser than Attack on Titan is good; I don't know if would be fully classified as horror but Death Note gets a bit creepy (plus it has a live action movie coming out)
[03/23/17, 3:08:09 AM] <starpilotsix> @zoidburg11 I think it's officially dead, replaced by in-house standard and rating policies that each company decides on their on own.
[03/23/17, 3:08:25 AM] <CarolineTheGeek> GDT <3
[03/23/17, 3:08:31 AM] <tara_the_cat> I'd recommend The Laughing Target by Rumiko Takahashi.
[03/23/17, 3:08:35 AM] <CharacterStigma> lol
[03/23/17, 3:08:39 AM] <CharacterStigma> dig it
[03/23/17, 3:08:40 AM] <snappywizard> @starpilotsix hmm interesting
[03/23/17, 3:08:41 AM] <JodyHouser> Junji Ito is one of the best I've ever seen at instilling dread in like ANY medium.
[03/23/17, 3:08:44 AM] <Triamas> robert rodriquez
[03/23/17, 3:08:45 AM] <JJ_Dane> This Del Toro guy sounds cool. Does he draw Batman?
[03/23/17, 3:08:49 AM] <japenrose> @JodyHouser Oh yeah! I've had weird dreams inspired by his work
[03/23/17, 3:08:50 AM] <Dark_Aardvark> Robert Rodriguez
[03/23/17, 3:08:51 AM] <Korthain> love this show
[03/23/17, 3:08:52 AM] <sashasklar> That's del toro right?

[03/23/17, 3:09:25 AM] <AnthonyHarrisArt> @JodyHouser What if I *like* my sanity and don't want Ito my brain *ever* again?
[03/23/17, 3:09:25 AM] <misssunflower94> PACRIM <3
[03/23/17, 3:09:47 AM] <DeLevely> @AnthonyHarrisArt Some things must be sacrificed at the altar of Awesome Comics, sanity among them
[03/23/17, 3:09:52 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @zoidburg11 No, it's dead for good (DC comics was the last to get rid of it after every other publisher banished it from their books. It died after that) and no, there are no lingering affects of it in comics these days (thank the gods)
[03/23/17, 3:09:57 AM] <coloursandtastes> Uzumaki, Gyo and The story of the mysterious tunnel are all great Junji Ito works
[03/23/17, 3:10:00 AM] <JodyHouser> @AnthonyHarrisArt Horror doesn't really affect me anymore so I can't help you there.
[03/23/17, 3:10:11 AM] <AnthonyHarrisArt> @DeLevely That is a fair assessment
[03/23/17, 3:10:13 AM] <sorcpenz> @AnthonyHarrisArt now you've convinced me I need to read Ito! XD
[03/23/17, 3:10:30 AM] <sorcpenz> lol
[03/23/17, 3:10:54 AM] <FatAth> lmao
[03/23/17, 3:11:02 AM] <Primejohn1> na na na swamp thing

[03/23/17, 3:11:17 AM] <AnthonyHarrisArt> @JodyHouser Movies don't bug me, horror comics, I think because art brain, will mess me right up

[03/23/17, 3:12:22 AM] <AnthonyHarrisArt> @sorcpenz Ito is, no lie, a great. You should absolutely look up the work, I am just a baby when it comes to horror comics *grin*
