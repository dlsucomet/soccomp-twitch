[04/5/17, 9:36:42 AM] <Rogue_13> SpeedDemonStar - maybe, but I heard no a-claws from the audience
[04/5/17, 9:36:44 AM] <Tearston3> Anybody know if Arse_queef is around?

[04/5/17, 9:37:43 AM] <Tearston3> Beep beep
[04/5/17, 9:37:43 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> or a cape
[04/5/17, 9:37:53 AM] <StickDeath1> if they are not careful with those lights, that faux fur of Trinkets can catch on fire due to exposed heat
[04/5/17, 9:37:56 AM] <Chovexani> Did Sax forget to wax again?
[04/5/17, 9:37:57 AM] <postdataest> is that the 'HAT Of Power' ?
[04/5/17, 9:37:59 AM] <Rogue_13> wait - a hairy beast in a hat ... how will we know who is sax and who is trinket? nothing is real!
[04/5/17, 9:38:00 AM] <Dragonchrome> Trinket will just have to grin and Bear it
[04/5/17, 9:38:01 AM] <Nethilim> Triket needs a BEARet
[04/5/17, 9:38:05 AM] <Kol_Drake> Smarter than the average bear!
[04/5/17, 9:38:10 AM] <mechagundamalpha01> is the sign part of the song sabotage from the Beastie Boys?
