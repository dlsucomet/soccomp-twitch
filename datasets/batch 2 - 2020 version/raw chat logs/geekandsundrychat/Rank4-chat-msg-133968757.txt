[04/7/17, 12:55:23 PM] <fajitasCommaNd> Still not perfect, but better. it's amazing how good the eyes are at catching the lack of sync. I've always wondered super low budget channels aren't impacted by issues, but GeekandSundry does. Although I could imagine it is a scale issue. :/
[04/7/17, 12:55:24 PM] <Woodbean> I've refreshed. I've turned HTML off and on and off and on. Still out of sync. Oh well
