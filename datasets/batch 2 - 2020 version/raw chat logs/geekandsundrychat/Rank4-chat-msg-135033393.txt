[04/12/17, 9:42:49 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> not to be a major grammarnazi or anything... but I think that statement needs at least one comma in it

[04/12/17, 9:43:18 AM] <scire> no commas...I prefer ellipses
[04/12/17, 9:43:19 AM] <Compel_Bast> The fact that sam grabbed the book, suggests it happened to Tary before
[04/12/17, 9:43:19 AM] <thedeadlypidgeon> Doty 2.0, where he can shrink and be pocket size.
[04/12/17, 9:43:28 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> like 17 minutes
[04/12/17, 9:43:32 AM] <dudemanbro000> they should make doty like the suits from iron man
