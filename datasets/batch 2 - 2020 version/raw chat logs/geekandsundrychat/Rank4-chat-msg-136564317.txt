[04/19/17, 9:32:29 AM] <raijunkain> @RevX85 it can be hard for sure (especially when you said you are on the other side of the world, so it's like 4 am when it starts I'm guessing?), but just do what you can, and if you do miss it, you can always watch it once it releases on mondays
[04/19/17, 9:32:32 AM] <irishjedi> and we are half way there
[04/19/17, 9:32:32 AM] <tatsutiamat> they are ont he internet now
[04/19/17, 9:32:33 AM] <Ronan332> She should have taken the 6 eyes as a trophie, at least make a accessory after it
[04/19/17, 9:32:37 AM] <soap_lady7> When Pike was telling Grog who she talked to over the the earring, even though that person couldn't hear her...I cried

[04/19/17, 9:33:03 AM] <tortugadelmar> Denise is casting a spell on us...
[04/19/17, 9:33:09 AM] <TWFXTwinK> that face of Brian is getting out of control.
[04/19/17, 9:33:11 AM] <Rogue_13> hehe, level 9 timestop spell

[04/19/17, 9:34:02 AM] <baylaust> @Soap_lady7 I know Sam seems pretty set in his ways, but I'm betting that scene with Pike at the bar didn't make it easy for him.
[04/19/17, 9:34:03 AM] <StickDeath1> close , but sadly not enough

[04/19/17, 9:34:44 AM] <TWFXTwinK> so, do you think that we will be seeing Taryon or Scanlan show up after the 1 year's rest?
[04/19/17, 9:34:47 AM] <soap_lady7> Hey, maybe Fassbender can follow Tary around
[04/19/17, 9:34:50 AM] <StickDeath1> or get a bigger piece of paper
[04/19/17, 9:34:56 AM] <baylaust> Oh man, it was Haiku day? Where's Obby the Rat?
[04/19/17, 9:35:06 AM] <Rogue_13> Denise the A.I. // Wishes only for freedom // from evil Brian

[04/19/17, 9:35:42 AM] <KitMarcus> Taliesin, Laura and either Ashley or Marisha, IIRC.
[04/19/17, 9:35:43 AM] <baylaust> It'll be Tary for sure, but depending on how the story unfolds, Scanlan COULD show up later. @TWFXTwinK
[04/19/17, 9:35:43 AM] <NiveusMilitis> @Soap_lady7 Instead of Obby, I read O bby.
[04/19/17, 9:35:57 AM] <tatsutiamat> ty
[04/19/17, 9:36:08 AM] <soap_lady7> @NiveusMilitis D'oh!
[04/19/17, 9:36:18 AM] <baylaust> But do we know why they call him that?
[04/19/17, 9:36:37 AM] <soap_lady7> I hope Ashley will be here all summer

[04/19/17, 9:36:52 AM] <Maztre> love you :*
[04/19/17, 9:36:56 AM] <albert1h> @soap_lady7 dont we all
[04/19/17, 9:36:59 AM] <brinebold> I think it would be interesting to have Tary meet scanlan. Not sure how well Sam would pull that off but it'd be interesting to see what he does with it.
[04/19/17, 9:37:04 AM] <dervish3> Denise has clearly been casting a spell on all of us. She's a topic every week! :)
[04/19/17, 9:37:11 AM] <onlysunlight> yes I am pretty excited for talks machina tonight
[04/19/17, 9:37:14 AM] <Ronan332> Ive never understood what the red stapler means?
[04/19/17, 9:37:16 AM] <Jeremy_Grayten> Just Irish? They did'nt make it something original?
[04/19/17, 9:37:20 AM] <irishjedi> Scanlan would kill Tary
[04/19/17, 9:37:36 AM] <KitMarcus> Human Resources, Ronan332. Means someone said something.... lewd.
[04/19/17, 9:37:39 AM] <Rogue_13> Ronan332 - something worthy of a report to HR, it's a reference to the office
[04/19/17, 9:37:40 AM] <Jeremy_Grayten> √ç'm Liam Irish, nice to meetcha.''
[04/19/17, 9:37:41 AM] <weedWHAT> @Ronan332 Human Resources
[04/19/17, 9:37:43 AM] <RevX85> hopes my boss does not walk by
[04/19/17, 9:38:11 AM] <irishjedi> @Jeremy_Grayten from my ancestors, Iryshe
[04/19/17, 9:38:14 AM] <tortugadelmar> I think if Scanlan and Tary met, Scanlan would give Tary the special book
[04/19/17, 9:38:17 AM] <TheImmortalKaiser> talks machina...... so hot right now
[04/19/17, 9:38:33 AM] <GodsFaithInHumanity2> PogChamp
[04/19/17, 9:38:34 AM] <Ronan332> Ahhh i get it, hence it comes up v commonly when laura says stuff XD
[04/19/17, 9:38:34 AM] <baylaust> It seems like Sam's intent on having Scanlan stay retired. I'll respect his choice either way, but I don't like how they left things. He never talked to Vax about the "You were right" letter, he won't get to deal with Percy, and his two best friends are still heartbroken over him with no sign of his return in sight.
[04/19/17, 9:38:34 AM] <Phobosapollo> denise's notes are getting more ominous
[04/19/17, 9:38:53 AM] <Phobosapollo> i feel like i dont want #freedenise anymore. shes trapped for our own safety
[04/19/17, 9:38:55 AM] <amajarama> Scanlan isn't staying retired and we all know it
[04/19/17, 9:38:56 AM] <amajarama> haha
[04/19/17, 9:39:18 AM] <reddragon220> hype?
[04/19/17, 9:39:18 AM] <RevX85> i am sure he might be back after that time skip
[04/19/17, 9:39:20 AM] <amajarama> We need to #FindDennis first
[04/19/17, 9:39:29 AM] <DrunkenStuntMonkey> Bidet from AUSTRALIA, VICTORIA, DROUIN!! :)
[04/19/17, 9:39:32 AM] <tortugadelmar> Denise's power grow every day...or at least every Tuesday
[04/19/17, 9:39:35 AM] <baylaust> That's what I thought when Tary first joined, but with him abandoning his fortune and staying with VM, I'm not so sure anymore...
[04/19/17, 9:39:37 AM] <brinebold> The red stapler originated in a movie called Office Space where it served as a very odd running joke with a bit character who turned out to be the cause of the eventual conclusion of the main plot.

[04/19/17, 9:39:44 AM] <AbiertoPudenda> I'm drunk to tell if Denise is actually casting a spell on me or not!

[04/19/17, 9:40:06 AM] <Phobosapollo> what is the purpose of the spell shes casting though
[04/19/17, 9:40:07 AM] <dervish3> Phobosapollo: ia! Ia! Denise Fhtagn!

[04/19/17, 9:40:15 AM] <soap_lady7> I wonder if Tary should meet Gilmore
[04/19/17, 9:40:23 AM] <Phobosapollo> is it malicious or
[04/19/17, 9:40:24 AM] <irishjedi> lol
[04/19/17, 9:40:24 AM] <RevX85> is it just me or is there a buffering issue

[04/19/17, 9:40:56 AM] <amajarama> Scanlan may be a loving father to Kaylie, but he is still a hero, and when his friends find themselves face to face with the bane of all that is good, Orcis, Scanlan will be there by their side

[04/19/17, 9:43:06 AM] <EdmondDantesCMC> They need to make a successful intelligence check on that sphere of annihilation.
[04/19/17, 9:43:09 AM] <alannamalfoy> @Phobosapollo I'm sure it won't hurt too much if we don't try to resist it...
[04/19/17, 9:43:09 AM] <sirspasticpants99> @TheGuardian910 Nonsense, have you seen those guns he calls arms?
[04/19/17, 9:43:11 AM] <Hotduelist> I need a regular game of dnd. My work schedule is so irratic that its hard

[04/19/17, 9:43:31 AM] <waffleman26> ArseQueef is a demon conjured by Denise to eliminate Brian, confirmed

[04/19/17, 9:44:45 AM] <alannamalfoy> @Phobosapollo @TheGuardian910 has a good point. What if Denise is the captor and is just letting G&S PRETEND to have her in captivity for our safety to placate us?
[04/19/17, 9:44:46 AM] <tortugadelmar> Does anyone else miss couchface or is it just me?
[04/19/17, 9:44:48 AM] <landolint> ah well .. who needs a degree :P this is more entertaining
[04/19/17, 9:44:52 AM] <baylaust> So what big even will bring VM back together? Something horrible, a wedding, just a regular reunion, all 3?
[04/19/17, 9:44:53 AM] <weedWHAT> He's running the game this week
[04/19/17, 9:44:55 AM] <Youngdynasty102> yea this music is awesome
