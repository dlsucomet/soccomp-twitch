[04/20/17, 6:31:28 AM] <gregzilla1> Woah, blue haired Amy! Holy shit!
[04/20/17, 6:31:39 AM] <sophitia42> Did the stream just stop and rewind for everyone, or is my internet crazy?
[04/20/17, 6:31:42 AM] <justjohnforever> @sophitia42 Fighting Man was pre-'78; Basic was (much like with Red Box) the four "human" classes: Thief, Figher, Magic-User and Cleric; the other options were Halfling, Elf and Dwarf (which is simply what you were: your race/profession, so to speak, were one-and-the-same. Elves were fighter-magic-users; Halflings were small Thieves; and Dwarves were angry Fighters... ;) )
[04/20/17, 6:31:42 AM] <chaoticloony> @maineogre THACO wasn't till 2E
[04/20/17, 6:31:47 AM] <TruckDrivingNrd> it looks great.
[04/20/17, 6:32:05 AM] <Cadmandu2000> @sophitia42 Yeah, I saw it too.
[04/20/17, 6:32:09 AM] <darkmoonrise312> @sophitia42 happened to me too
[04/20/17, 6:32:13 AM] <TheMysticZealot> "Magic-user"
[04/20/17, 6:32:16 AM] <TheMysticZealot> love it
[04/20/17, 6:32:24 AM] <sophitia42> Okay, thanks everyone.
[04/20/17, 6:32:27 AM] <Chovexani> There we go a smile from Amy  :3
[04/20/17, 6:32:50 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> @sophitia42, Chronomancers at G&S are experimenting, that's all ;)
[04/20/17, 6:33:14 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> I'm still used to Blonde Amy, but I do like Colourful Amy :)
[04/20/17, 6:33:38 AM] <justjohnforever> @chaoticloony THACO was in 1st Ed, too. (I know -- I played it back in '83 onwards. ;) )
[04/20/17, 6:33:53 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> THAC0 - To Hit Armor Class 0
[04/20/17, 6:34:01 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> It was traumatizing.
[04/20/17, 6:34:11 AM] <Chovexani> I read Thaco and I think of Goblins XD
[04/20/17, 6:34:34 AM] <chaoticloony> @justjohnforever I have been playing since 82 and before 2E all we ever had was the chart
[04/20/17, 6:34:34 AM] <Mortie3> agreed
[04/20/17, 6:34:46 AM] <darkmoonrise312> Wasn't elf a class at the start?

[04/20/17, 6:35:02 AM] <sophitia42> Double songs?  Win.
[04/20/17, 6:35:18 AM] <JeffM0307> I think they recorded this part
[04/20/17, 6:35:19 AM] <chaoticloony> @darkmoonrise312 It was in Basic!
[04/20/17, 6:35:41 AM] <Cadmandu2000> @JeffM0307 I was just thinking the same thing.
[04/20/17, 6:36:01 AM] <JeffM0307> @Cadmandu2000 Probably just for this week
[04/20/17, 6:36:01 AM] <darkmoonrise312> Thanks
[04/20/17, 6:36:18 AM] <Cadmandu2000> It makes sense for them to do it.
[04/20/17, 6:36:34 AM] <chaoticloony> Who remembers Bargle and the cleric!
[04/20/17, 6:36:35 AM] <CaptianTrips88> they've been running prerecorded songs for weeks now
[04/20/17, 6:36:48 AM] <soul2092> Anyone experienced in D&D got a question to ask when taking on a second class
[04/20/17, 6:36:57 AM] <JeffM0307> @CaptianTrips88 Oh, I didn't know that.
[04/20/17, 6:37:17 AM] <chaoticloony> @soul2092 what about it?
[04/20/17, 6:37:21 AM] <justjohnforever> @chaoticloony I think, perhaps, it depends on the conventions you may have played at/with. "THACO" was the go-to term for the chart system (which still was in-effect for 2nd Ed. just presented differently) at the conventions I played at in the 80s, and the term was carried on to 2nd Ed. before (correctly) being dropped in 3rd.
[04/20/17, 6:37:26 AM] <Cadmandu2000> I have missing the intros lately.
[04/20/17, 6:37:28 AM] <Cfry92> shoot soul
[04/20/17, 6:37:46 AM] <gregzilla1> Can't get over blue-haired Amy. Damn! :)

[04/20/17, 6:39:15 AM] <Ossborn> Ivan looks so strange today ^^
[04/20/17, 6:39:27 AM] <justjohnforever> @chaoticloony (cont'd) It's kind of like how "Feats" (though called different things  by different groups) existed for over a decade before 3rd came out; I know several groups I played with, personally, started using a "Special Abilities" house-rule since '88 (which were essentially what were later called Feats by 3rd). A lot of stuff was in-use at "official" conventions for some time...
[04/20/17, 6:39:35 AM] <gouver> heu
[04/20/17, 6:39:36 AM] <Chovexani> *SQUEEEE(
