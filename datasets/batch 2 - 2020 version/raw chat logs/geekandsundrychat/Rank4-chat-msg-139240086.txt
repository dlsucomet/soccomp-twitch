[04/30/17, 4:53:08 AM] <Fu4ow> ooooooh wonderful setting
[04/30/17, 4:53:08 AM] <pellogrese> Wizards is a sorta co-op game in that although one person is the final one responsible for defeating the baddie, you still all must work together or the world is overwhelmed and you all lose. Plus you construct the board itself by playing 'islands' on an ocean mat, so each game is different.
[04/30/17, 4:53:10 AM] <EncantadorTheGamer> @CaptainMunden Hm. Modern art, high-quality minis. Maybe, maybe.
