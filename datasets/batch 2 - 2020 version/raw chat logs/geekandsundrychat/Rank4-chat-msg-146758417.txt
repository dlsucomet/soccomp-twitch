[05/24/17, 9:39:04 AM] <Dragonchrome> If you are having buffering issues try the following 1) refreshing first always, 2) try dropping video quality to medium, low or mobile (mobile quality is pants but you can still hear) , 3) then try turning off html 5 and 4) try a browser like firefox
[05/24/17, 9:39:26 AM] <Dragonchrome> @StickDeath1 it will be here before you know it

[05/24/17, 9:40:06 AM] <JonusOctavian> People still use Firefox because Chrome is a memory leaking POS.
