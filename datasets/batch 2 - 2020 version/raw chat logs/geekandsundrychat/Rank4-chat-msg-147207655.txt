[05/26/17, 9:46:05 AM] <StickWithTheHeart> I don't really expect soo much from kiki... way she plays, turning into a goldfish.... I dunno..
[05/26/17, 9:46:07 AM] <raygun28> @stargazer1977 Kiki could feeblemind grog BibleThump
[05/26/17, 9:46:10 AM] <jadenest> If all the characters were equally skilled I'd give it to Keyleth easily. Druids are broken in pvp. But I don't think Keyleth will win for obvious reasons.
[05/26/17, 9:46:10 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> lmao, yeah, @xFurax Grog's gonna get kited for days.
[05/26/17, 9:46:10 AM] <Remiel_Gaming> the big change is that everyone has a Vestige to play around with (except Tary)

[05/26/17, 9:47:10 AM] <LucasBlackstone> It depends on if Matt lets Vax hide in the "arena" they are in. Otherwise his damage is not on par with the others.
