[05/26/17, 10:07:26 AM] <gilgoomesh> I wanna see Earth Element Keyleth versus Grog in a punching match.
[05/26/17, 10:07:26 AM] <Golmultarn> If vex and Percy get above Keyleth in the initiative order, they could focus fire on her and kill her in the first round.
[05/26/17, 10:07:27 AM] <Cardamonelaw> Vex is kind of a threat though, along with Keyleth... I'd personally target her first.
[05/26/17, 10:07:29 AM] <specpol> My money's on grog for the win- Percy will be down first

[05/26/17, 10:10:52 AM] <pants__cat> If Grog has access to the deck in this AU and does not utilize its powers, I would be slightly disappointed.
[05/26/17, 10:10:53 AM] <forestfieldforestfield> I am fine with 10 min of trash talk
[05/26/17, 10:10:53 AM] <Cardamonelaw> Vex's broom does not require attunement... she technically is a loot crate. :P
[05/26/17, 10:10:54 AM] <CrowHollow> ...and so it begins. GULP!!!
[05/26/17, 10:10:54 AM] <Fourleafclov> Would Keyleth lose concentration on Shapechange? or does that not work that way

[05/26/17, 10:11:16 AM] <RainaThrownAway> @Pyrotechnick777 This is entirely noncanon, so yes, if he uses a card from the deck, it will remain in the deck.
[05/26/17, 10:11:16 AM] <upgrayedd88> anyone elses emotes locked?
[05/26/17, 10:11:17 AM] <Assteral> Oh yeah Percy could summon his demon horde

[05/26/17, 10:11:28 AM] <GaeaCa> @Kosenjou Today is battle royale not a regular episode

[05/26/17, 10:11:30 AM] <nennoh20> Nooooo I meant to vote NoMercyPercy and put the money on Tary instead. Not that I don't think Tary will do well... but for realsies my money's on Percy.
