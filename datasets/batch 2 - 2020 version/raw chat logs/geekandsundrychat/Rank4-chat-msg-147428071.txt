[05/27/17, 3:07:35 AM] <starpilotsix> When I was a kid I thought that if I jumped off a high place and flapped my coat really hard I could maybe fly. Just not enough to actually try it.

[05/27/17, 3:12:14 AM] <lixyewup> 80s are better than the 90s. The 90s was a period when people forgot what sanity was.
