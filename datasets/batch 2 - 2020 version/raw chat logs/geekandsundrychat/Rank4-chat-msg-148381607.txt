[05/31/17, 9:37:28 AM] <ClassAct> I truly don't understand how anyone can dislike any of these people / characters. Had the pleasure of meeting them at Momo. Easily some of the most wonderful people I've ever met.
[05/31/17, 9:37:40 AM] <Leigh574> Hello Hoomans <3
[05/31/17, 9:38:02 AM] <stargazer1977> I watched the Momo panel yesterday, that was really fun. Poor lady and gents were so jet lagged.
[05/31/17, 9:38:02 AM] <Croswynd> Some people just don't like some people. Not everyone can please everyone, sadly.
