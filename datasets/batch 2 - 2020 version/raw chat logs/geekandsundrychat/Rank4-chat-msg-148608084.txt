[06/1/17, 3:04:23 AM] <101deadpool1017> All hail chief, our Yellow Boxed Overloard!
[06/1/17, 3:04:27 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @DeLevely @ficklefandoms Yeah my NB pals! :D I might be dating another NB soon! They are great, I'm gonna help them pick out a dress on friday :D
[06/1/17, 3:04:28 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> Remember a while back (Rucka run) how WW blinded herself so she could decapitate Medusa?
[06/1/17, 3:04:30 AM] <sp_acevex> the rails just don't exist @mattypick22 @misssunflower94
[06/1/17, 3:04:37 AM] <japenrose> @Soap_lady7 Coming from the civilization she does, it certainly makes sense
[06/1/17, 3:04:37 AM] <soap_lady7> WW's creator was polyamorous and into BDSM so it's cool to think she's queer
[06/1/17, 3:04:37 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[06/1/17, 3:04:41 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> I think that was Rucka...
[06/1/17, 3:04:42 AM] <The___writer> sup chat ❤❤❤
[06/1/17, 3:04:44 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @delevely Congrats on finishing a major project though!
[06/1/17, 3:04:45 AM] <figure_04> @Chovexani Thanks, I put some effort into it.
[06/1/17, 3:04:46 AM] <starpilotsix> It occurs to me it'd be fun if Wednesday Club had a different "cover image" to open each issue.
[06/1/17, 3:04:47 AM] <SighMartini> the wild contagious enthusiasm balances out the linear analysis
[06/1/17, 3:04:54 AM] <DeLevely> Thanks @ShandraVdeG !
[06/1/17, 3:04:55 AM] <soap_lady7> @japenrose Glad to know it's not just me
[06/1/17, 3:04:58 AM] <Kabrielle> it'll be nice to listen to someone else talk about Wonder Woman comics for a change.
[06/1/17, 3:04:59 AM] <AnicientBolt> @DeLevely Must be satisfying knowing you've finished a big project though.
[06/1/17, 3:05:01 AM] <Tacotownindustries> woo
[06/1/17, 3:05:02 AM] <101deadpool1017> Wednesday Club Assemble!!!

[06/1/17, 3:05:11 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> OMFG TAL THAT TIARA
[06/1/17, 3:05:13 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> Hi Amy, Matt, Taliesin :D
[06/1/17, 3:05:13 AM] <iviarelle> omg the intro plays exactly as I sit down on the couch. HELLO!
[06/1/17, 3:05:13 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> @Soap_lady7 she is canonically bi
[06/1/17, 3:05:14 AM] <soap_lady7> Tali is rocking that tiara
[06/1/17, 3:05:14 AM] <AromiaFlyce> EEEHEHEH
[06/1/17, 3:05:14 AM] <japenrose> YES!
[06/1/17, 3:05:15 AM] <misssunflower94> Nice tiara Tal
[06/1/17, 3:05:16 AM] <JJ_Dane> Hey Amy, hey Taliesin, hey Matt
[06/1/17, 3:05:17 AM] <darkofnate> @starpilotsix They kind of do, with the chalk artwork
[06/1/17, 3:05:17 AM] <sp_acevex> ww's creator was married to a woman who graduated from the college i go to so that's hella cool
[06/1/17, 3:05:17 AM] <japenrose> YES YES YES!
[06/1/17, 3:05:18 AM] <DeLevely> Amy's excited!!
[06/1/17, 3:05:18 AM] <AromiaFlyce> I love the headband!
[06/1/17, 3:05:18 AM] <TerribleMachines> That chalk art though :D
[06/1/17, 3:05:22 AM] <figure_04> ... Isn't she always radiating with happiness?
[06/1/17, 3:05:23 AM] <cinphoria> YAY!
[06/1/17, 3:05:23 AM] <criticalmasterpiece> Boo yah!!!!
[06/1/17, 3:05:24 AM] <stargazer1977> The two women that he was "married to" stayed together even after he died. So more than likely it was a true poly relationship between the three.
[06/1/17, 3:05:24 AM] <JeffM0307> Did Amy make you do this, guys? :)
[06/1/17, 3:05:25 AM] <Compel_Bast> I always kinda figured, "I mean, like, isn't that completely logical... being like... ancient Greek and living and growing up in a place where as far as you know Women are the only people who exist."

[06/1/17, 3:05:41 AM] <CasGT> aloha everyone

[06/1/17, 3:05:54 AM] <AromiaFlyce> OMG THE CAPE
[06/1/17, 3:05:55 AM] <Kabrielle> he really pulls the tiara off well
[06/1/17, 3:05:55 AM] <soap_lady7> She gave him that cape
[06/1/17, 3:05:55 AM] <cinphoria> Taliesin needs to wear more tiaras
[06/1/17, 3:06:00 AM] <CriticalFlail> omg Yes Tal & Matt
[06/1/17, 3:06:01 AM] <Chovexani> Hehe spin
[06/1/17, 3:06:01 AM] <101deadpool1017> Matt Key wear's that Cape around the house on the Weekends
[06/1/17, 3:06:01 AM] <ficklefandoms> Sorry Matt, you're too tall! XD
[06/1/17, 3:06:01 AM] <DeLevely> @cinphoria Agreed
[06/1/17, 3:06:04 AM] <ToonEzon> do the full spin do the full spin
[06/1/17, 3:06:04 AM] <TerribleMachines> Taliesin your tiara/headband is gorious!
[06/1/17, 3:06:05 AM] <zathyr> Yeah I'm not sure I notice the difference in this Amy
[06/1/17, 3:06:06 AM] <jcnorn> Taliesin looks amazing in a tiara
[06/1/17, 3:06:06 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[06/1/17, 3:06:07 AM] <soap_lady7> I wanna see WW this weekend
[06/1/17, 3:06:07 AM] <ficklefandoms> @cinphoria agreed
[06/1/17, 3:06:08 AM] <misssunflower94> Taliesin how many tiaras do you have? ;)
[06/1/17, 3:06:08 AM] <Chovexani> Giant Matt problems
[06/1/17, 3:06:10 AM] <jessicadru> Tiaras need to come back into style
[06/1/17, 3:06:12 AM] <darkofnate> Do the Linda Carter spin!
[06/1/17, 3:06:12 AM] <cinphoria> EVERYONE needs to wear more tiaras if they feel like tiaras!
[06/1/17, 3:06:12 AM] <Bitgod> If Matt spins faster, he'll change into Lynda Carter's costume
[06/1/17, 3:06:22 AM] <stargazer1977> @Soap_lady7 The history of Wonder Woman is almost more interesting than the comics themselves. :)
[06/1/17, 3:06:22 AM] <EternisRequiem> lol
[06/1/17, 3:06:23 AM] <SighMartini> In my head canon WW is 6 ft 5 inches

[06/1/17, 3:06:43 AM] <tortugadelmar> Love Tallesin's Tiara/crown
[06/1/17, 3:06:48 AM] <JJ_Dane> Every year I say capes need to come back, and every year I don't. Figure I'm just going to have to get one :-)
[06/1/17, 3:06:49 AM] <Chovexani> What o.O
[06/1/17, 3:06:49 AM] <Kabrielle> god, all the WW merch in stores right now is gonna put a dent on my savings
[06/1/17, 3:06:50 AM] <DeLevely> Is Wonder Woman the Christmas present for the TBD RPG Christmas Special?
[06/1/17, 3:06:51 AM] <Chovexani> wooooow
[06/1/17, 3:06:53 AM] <Beibhin> IT IS WONDERWOMAN CHRISTMAS
[06/1/17, 3:06:57 AM] <cinphoria> HALLO CHAT you are so excited today
[06/1/17, 3:06:58 AM] <JJ_Dane> *they
[06/1/17, 3:06:59 AM] <CriticalFlail> i want dat pop funko <3
[06/1/17, 3:06:59 AM] <The_TBoyce> I got to see Wonder Woman already! I won't spoil, but here's my take: not a perfect movie, but the best so far in the DCEU. Gal Gadot's acting alone is worth the price of admission.
[06/1/17, 3:07:00 AM] <pagerunnerj> The tiara is fantastic.
[06/1/17, 3:07:03 AM] <soap_lady7> All the chat is waiting for you...and the power you possess....
[06/1/17, 3:07:04 AM] <lixyewup> One of the most loved unless you're a sad manbaby.

[06/1/17, 3:07:09 AM] <japenrose> @DeLevely Definitely
[06/1/17, 3:07:10 AM] <darkofnate> Always makes me sad when people leave Funkos in the box
[06/1/17, 3:07:12 AM] <101deadpool1017> Wonder Woman was also created by a guy that was into BDSM....... O.O
[06/1/17, 3:07:14 AM] <ficklefandoms> right now I'm not sure whether to say "get you someone who looks at you like Taliesin & Matt are looking at Amy right now" or "get you someone who talks about you like Amy talks about Wonder Woman"
[06/1/17, 3:07:15 AM] <Chovexani> 75 years that's .. mind blown
[06/1/17, 3:07:21 AM] <The_TBoyce> Aw, widdle Wonder Woman Funko!

[06/1/17, 3:07:33 AM] <Daemonblight> :O
[06/1/17, 3:07:34 AM] <soap_lady7> @101deadpool1017 And helped invent the lie detector
[06/1/17, 3:07:38 AM] <FuffyButt> that is nice
[06/1/17, 3:07:38 AM] <chaoticloony> This is such a great example of why Amy is so loved by Chat!
[06/1/17, 3:07:42 AM] <Chovexani> I want a wonderwoman box
[06/1/17, 3:07:43 AM] <Kabrielle> having read golden age comics I think that was not an uncommon interest
[06/1/17, 3:07:43 AM] <stargazer1977> My favorite two parts of Wonder Woman is the history of the creators and the Greek Mythology. I'm a huge fan of comparative mythology (Joseph Campbell and such), and especially the Greeks and Norse.
[06/1/17, 3:07:44 AM] <Chovexani> :o

[06/1/17, 3:09:03 AM] <EmperorMoley> So wait. Does Amy like Wonder Woman or not??
[06/1/17, 3:09:04 AM] <cardinaliron> We don't acknowledge all those Batman movies.
[06/1/17, 3:09:11 AM] <JodyHouser> Mask of the Phantasm is the best Batman movie
[06/1/17, 3:09:11 AM] <AromiaFlyce> @GeekandSundry Ok, so far? This is my favorite episode of Weds. Club!
[06/1/17, 3:09:12 AM] <ficklefandoms> Taliesin can wear ANYTHING as far as I care
[06/1/17, 3:09:13 AM] <ToonEzon> QUESTION: can y'all please do the wonder woman spin at some point before today's show is over?
[06/1/17, 3:09:14 AM] <Daemonblight> so many batman movies, cartoons and tv shows
[06/1/17, 3:09:15 AM] <darkofnate> The bad ones are sometimes more enjoyable
[06/1/17, 3:09:17 AM] <ficklefandoms> and still look cool
[06/1/17, 3:09:17 AM] <RuzgofDI> Hell, Catwoman's had a film. About damn time Diana got one
[06/1/17, 3:09:18 AM] <PrimroseFrost> Does anyone else want Tal to wear the tiara tomorrow night for Critical Role?
[06/1/17, 3:09:18 AM] <SpaceGhostOfficial> honestly tal can wear anything and not look silly
[06/1/17, 3:09:19 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> Batman '66 is pretty great, tbh
[06/1/17, 3:09:21 AM] <Lh_sabre> Who isn't in love with Amy? Adorable
[06/1/17, 3:09:24 AM] <TerribleMachines> @SpaceGhostOfficial That's her super-hero name right there!
[06/1/17, 3:09:26 AM] <japenrose> This is true
[06/1/17, 3:09:26 AM] <sp_acevex> wednesday club always make my day brighter
[06/1/17, 3:09:28 AM] <BeelzeBee> It's the only movie I WANT to see in theaters since Lord of the Rings
[06/1/17, 3:09:31 AM] <CriticalFlail> hahaha
[06/1/17, 3:09:32 AM] <CharacterStigma> Keepo Keepo ANT--MAN
[06/1/17, 3:09:33 AM] <Asrathiel2912> I still want a Squirrel Girl movie
[06/1/17, 3:09:35 AM] <101deadpool1017> The DC trinity is complete

[06/1/17, 3:09:37 AM] <The___writer> 66 is also my favourite Batman film
[06/1/17, 3:09:38 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> :D
[06/1/17, 3:09:42 AM] <cardinaliron> Well Marvel is a movie making machine, and has been for years now.
[06/1/17, 3:09:43 AM] <soap_lady7> We need more female protagonists, especially WOC
[06/1/17, 3:09:44 AM] <G03933> spiderman has more movies
[06/1/17, 3:09:45 AM] <stargazer1977> One of the things that I want them to talk about is the fact that of all the Justice League, the only one that doesn't really have any weaknesses is Wonder Woman. Even as a male, she's an important superhero to me.
[06/1/17, 3:09:46 AM] <jcnorn> Taliesin should always wear tiaras, he looks so dashing and glorious
[06/1/17, 3:09:46 AM] <japenrose> Oh boy
[06/1/17, 3:09:48 AM] <Chovexani> Gods I can't even
[06/1/17, 3:09:49 AM] <ToonEzon> took long enough for her to finlly get her own movie
[06/1/17, 3:09:51 AM] <starpilotsix> So on Eric's TBD RPG this week Amy will possibly be super emotional
[06/1/17, 3:09:52 AM] <JodyHouser> I DIDN'T KNOW ARCLIGHT HAD 90MM
[06/1/17, 3:09:53 AM] <SpaceGhostOfficial> #reasons
[06/1/17, 3:09:54 AM] <japenrose> It's INTENSE
[06/1/17, 3:09:55 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> Oooohh.... *is very jealous*
[06/1/17, 3:09:56 AM] <ToonEzon> also yay 70mm
[06/1/17, 3:09:56 AM] <ginny7> The tiara does look killer with his hair :D
[06/1/17, 3:09:59 AM] <Chovexani> So baaaaad
[06/1/17, 3:10:02 AM] <Triamas> I wonder what reasons
[06/1/17, 3:10:02 AM] <DeLevely> @JodyHouser Yeah, it's the giant dome one!
[06/1/17, 3:10:03 AM] <freshmaker__> Is it Thursday yet?
[06/1/17, 3:10:04 AM] <Kylar616> lmao playing dnd instead of wonder woman
[06/1/17, 3:10:04 AM] <JodyHouser> @starpilotsix Me too
[06/1/17, 3:10:08 AM] <Danciful> lmao bless poor Taliesin
[06/1/17, 3:10:10 AM] <buttassbooty> I wonder if Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor saying Nuke-u-lar instead of Nuclear was in the script or an acting decision of Hackman's
[06/1/17, 3:10:10 AM] <MeganeGirl> lololol
[06/1/17, 3:10:11 AM] <soap_lady7> WW taught me kindness is strength
[06/1/17, 3:10:19 AM] <ArtofBartlett> WAIT?! DOES SOMETHING HAPPEN HERE ON THURSDAY NIGHTS?!
[06/1/17, 3:10:19 AM] <Bitgod> You know the WW movie with Kathy Lee Giffard and Ricardo Montalban was the best. Fight Me
[06/1/17, 3:10:28 AM] <soap_lady7> Give us WW shirts!
[06/1/17, 3:10:32 AM] <AnicientBolt> Amy wasn't going to have a shirt to fit Matt
[06/1/17, 3:10:33 AM] <japenrose> @JodyHouser Yeah! Arclight is usually the main one who does it in that MM that I know of!
[06/1/17, 3:10:34 AM] <Triamas> !mnctimer
[06/1/17, 3:10:35 AM] <Nightbot> There is currently 23 Hours, 49 Minutes, 25 Seconds until the next amazing episodes of Mines 'N' Crafts!
[06/1/17, 3:10:36 AM] <jessicadru> the world needs more WW swag
[06/1/17, 3:10:37 AM] <EmperorMoley> I think Tailspin is rocking that tiara
[06/1/17, 3:10:39 AM] <darkofnate> @Karbacca Yes, the replay of Game the Game
[06/1/17, 3:10:39 AM] <ficklefandoms> SOMEONE PHOTOSHOP TALIESIN IN A BLUE DENIM JACKET RIGHT MEOW
[06/1/17, 3:10:40 AM] <CriticalFlail> I think Tal can pull off all the things
[06/1/17, 3:10:42 AM] <cinphoria> thinks about tiny Taliesin in a blue denim shirt >.>
[06/1/17, 3:10:43 AM] <pagerunnerj> I used to have Wonder Woman Underoos. Oh, the '80s. :)
[06/1/17, 3:10:44 AM] <shelbyknox> @Karbacca Nope. Just a few hours of test and tone
[06/1/17, 3:10:45 AM] <soap_lady7> @Bitgod I think that was Cathy Lee Crosby
[06/1/17, 3:10:46 AM] <CharacterStigma> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[06/1/17, 3:10:47 AM] <SpaceGhostOfficial> squirrel girrrrrl
[06/1/17, 3:10:49 AM] <BeelzeBee> : O! Taliesin, Denim is super goth, what's wrong with you? Sheesh! Turbonegro!!!???
[06/1/17, 3:10:50 AM] <Chovexani> Ooooo
[06/1/17, 3:10:51 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> I saw an amazing Wonder Woman skirt on Hot Topic the other day...
[06/1/17, 3:10:52 AM] <maineogre> WW movie with Cathy Lee Crosby
[06/1/17, 3:10:52 AM] <JodyHouser> @DeLevely I can't see in the Dome unless I'm up high
[06/1/17, 3:10:56 AM] <Chovexani> that cup so pretty
[06/1/17, 3:10:59 AM] <soap_lady7> @pagerunnerj OMG! Me too!
[06/1/17, 3:11:03 AM] <stano430> nice squirrel girl thermos
[06/1/17, 3:11:05 AM] <ArtofBartlett> AH! RIGHT! Nothing big on Thursdays
[06/1/17, 3:11:08 AM] <CriticalFlail> that is fantastic
[06/1/17, 3:11:09 AM] <DeLevely> @JodyHouser relatable, that's one of the reasons I don't tend to do Arclight for movies like these
[06/1/17, 3:11:10 AM] <chaoticloony> Wonder Woman is the only female heroine that the majority of people would know.
[06/1/17, 3:11:22 AM] <TerribleMachines> @Karbacca I think there's like a D&D thing, or something.... right? Heard it's not that great though. Lol jk Criticial Role FTW.
[06/1/17, 3:11:23 AM] <jessicadru> best wifey
[06/1/17, 3:11:23 AM] <misssunflower94> Nothing like big work conferences to remind me what a shy child I am. Can't talk to anybody.
[06/1/17, 3:11:24 AM] <Bitgod> @Soap_lady7 That sounds correct. I knew it was a Lee
[06/1/17, 3:11:24 AM] <JeffM0307> Welcome to the Wonder Woman Shopping Network! :)
[06/1/17, 3:11:25 AM] <Todschnitter> Will you be talking about the New 52 Wonder Woman series?
[06/1/17, 3:11:28 AM] <Chovexani> Arclight? @DeLevely
[06/1/17, 3:11:29 AM] <JodyHouser> I'm going to Sherman Oaks Arclight
[06/1/17, 3:11:33 AM] <101deadpool1017> Hey Everyone. Teefury does sell some awesome Wonder Woman shirts, if you're interested.
[06/1/17, 3:11:33 AM] <Danoba> !questions
[06/1/17, 3:11:33 AM] <Nightbot> To make it easier to read questions in chat, please preface your questions with the word question in all caps. For example, QUESTION: How are you today?
[06/1/17, 3:11:34 AM] <PrydeNPaine> That's awesome! Love Squirrel Girl - I got the keychain in the blind bag finally.
[06/1/17, 3:11:38 AM] <FuffyButt> you can get the mug at the dollar store, the photo can be added easy
[06/1/17, 3:11:40 AM] <stano430> the amazing Dr Strange
[06/1/17, 3:11:40 AM] <Kabrielle> I'd argue Storm is pretty identifiable for most muggles
[06/1/17, 3:11:40 AM] <DeLevely> @Chovexani Arclight is a movie theatre in LA
[06/1/17, 3:11:43 AM] <soap_lady7> I want some WW undies for grown ups
[06/1/17, 3:11:47 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> I am always so happy and filled with love whenever I see Wednesday Club.
[06/1/17, 3:11:47 AM] <stargazer1977> @chaoticloony I agree, but I hope Captain Marvel will get more popular after her movie as well. That's also a great character.
[06/1/17, 3:11:51 AM] <Chovexani> Ohhhh gotcha :D thnx
[06/1/17, 3:11:54 AM] <EmperorMoley> Can someone reboot Amy please?
[06/1/17, 3:11:55 AM] <japenrose> I've had goo experiences with Regal at LA Live, so I'm heading there!
[06/1/17, 3:11:55 AM] <Kabrielle> Torrid has WW undies
[06/1/17, 3:11:57 AM] <DeLevely> @JodyHouser I'm going to wing it and go somewhere after TBD RPG
[06/1/17, 3:11:58 AM] <cinphoria> Matt Key is adorable today in that blankie-like cape and drinking from an oversized raccoon mug ;_;
[06/1/17, 3:12:02 AM] <japenrose> good*

[06/1/17, 3:12:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> QUESTION: Who would you say is the best Wonder Woman villain? Superman has Lex Luthor, Batman has the Joker...who is Wonder Woman's arch-nemesis?
[06/1/17, 3:12:23 AM] <soap_lady7> Cheetah
[06/1/17, 3:12:25 AM] <Kabrielle> (The amount of money I spent when MAC had a WW limited edition line)
[06/1/17, 3:12:28 AM] <JJ_Dane> Cheetah
[06/1/17, 3:12:28 AM] <Kylar616> Men is her arch nemesis
[06/1/17, 3:12:28 AM] <figure_04> Looking forward to Captain Marvel.
[06/1/17, 3:12:28 AM] <buttassbooty> QUESTION: How did you feel about New-52 Wonder Woman's relationship with Ares before Rebirth?
[06/1/17, 3:12:33 AM] <stargazer1977> Ares is definitely my favorite WW villain. But I really love mythology.
[06/1/17, 3:12:33 AM] <DeLevely> Amy, we're going to give it ALL OUR MONEY so this will be a huge success and they make a million of these
[06/1/17, 3:12:43 AM] <CspiderMx> Cheetah or Ares
[06/1/17, 3:12:45 AM] <misssunflower94> Question for Amy: who was your first female superhero?
[06/1/17, 3:12:48 AM] <ArtofBartlett> BLADE! The new comic movie renaissance started with BLADE!
[06/1/17, 3:12:50 AM] <Obito_13> yeah I thought it used to be cheetah
[06/1/17, 3:12:51 AM] <japenrose> This is true
[06/1/17, 3:12:52 AM] <soap_lady7> @Kabrielle Mine was sold out and it had a 200% markup on Ebay
[06/1/17, 3:12:53 AM] <TerribleMachines> @EmperorMoley I dunno, I mean overly-enthusiastic Amy is pretty great, I kinda wanna keep her :L
[06/1/17, 3:12:54 AM] <The_TBoyce> @cinphoria Warner Bros. must hate him...they REALLY hate a company that may or may not have a talking raccoon.
[06/1/17, 3:12:55 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @DeLevely Drag Tal to whatever viewing you're gonna see, because he talked on facebook about having no time
[06/1/17, 3:12:55 AM] <HymnGall> QUESTION: Who is the Cheeta?
[06/1/17, 3:12:57 AM] <cinphoria> I can't stand DC but I'm still gonna see it just to support it
[06/1/17, 3:12:57 AM] <Kabrielle> I try not to think about a lot of Nu52 WW
[06/1/17, 3:13:05 AM] <SighMartini> i know so little about Cheetah
[06/1/17, 3:13:12 AM] <Triamas> QUESTION: If I've never read any Wonder Woman at all, where should I start?
[06/1/17, 3:13:12 AM] <DeLevely> @Andrea_Cordes I believe we will not have him on TBD RPG on Friday?
[06/1/17, 3:13:23 AM] <CharacterStigma> TakeNRG TehePelo GivePLZ
[06/1/17, 3:13:23 AM] <Chovexani> ooh dat Wonder Woman chalk board art
[06/1/17, 3:13:24 AM] <Compel_Bast> I'm surprised at the lack of complaints of, "it's just a gender flipped Captain America"
[06/1/17, 3:13:26 AM] <ToonEzon> @GInquisitor I would imagine her memesis would be some god
[06/1/17, 3:13:26 AM] <SpaceGhostOfficial> @cinphoria same, i'm just stoked to have a film done by ladies staring a lady
[06/1/17, 3:13:27 AM] <soap_lady7> Greg Rucka and Gail Simone are the best
[06/1/17, 3:13:27 AM] <DeLevely> @Andrea_Cordes I would love to go see a comics movie with Tal tho!
[06/1/17, 3:13:29 AM] <101deadpool1017> Catwoman got a movie before Wonder Woman
[06/1/17, 3:13:30 AM] <figure_04> @Karbacca Not Blade. Too many people didn't realize Blade was a comic. It started with Spider-Man.
[06/1/17, 3:13:32 AM] <chaoticloony> @stargazer1977 I also hope she becomes huge!
[06/1/17, 3:13:32 AM] <ToonEzon> QUESTION: can you guys please do the Wonder Woman spin sometime before todays show ends?
[06/1/17, 3:13:33 AM] <ficklefandoms> seventy-five years
[06/1/17, 3:13:36 AM] <CharacterStigma> GivePLZ TehePelo TakeNRG
[06/1/17, 3:13:38 AM] <Chovexani> The spin of the show *squee*
[06/1/17, 3:13:41 AM] <stano430> she's a wonder
[06/1/17, 3:13:42 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm much more of a Marvel fan than a DC fan, but I will support this fully. I just want good movies, and I also really want more female superhero movies.
[06/1/17, 3:13:42 AM] <cinphoria> @Compel_Bast except she's not at all...
[06/1/17, 3:13:43 AM] <The_TBoyce> And Black Widow is still waiting, five years after The Avengers... :(
[06/1/17, 3:13:44 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @DeLevely Oh that's too bad :/ I thought he was only busy last friday, not this one
[06/1/17, 3:13:47 AM] <sp_acevex> QUESTION: who is your favorite wonder woman villain
[06/1/17, 3:13:47 AM] <CriticalFlail> only 75yrs. girl power everyone.
[06/1/17, 3:13:52 AM] <soap_lady7> Led by Hippolyta
[06/1/17, 3:13:55 AM] <JodyHouser> Catwoman solo movie wasn't even Selina Kyle. And it was awful
[06/1/17, 3:13:57 AM] <cinphoria> @SpaceGhostOfficial ^5
[06/1/17, 3:13:57 AM] <Beibhin> I just need it to be Thursday as I won tickets to it in Ireland!
[06/1/17, 3:14:00 AM] <freshmaker__> *SARCASM* but a female lead wouldnt sell movies!! *SARCASM*
[06/1/17, 3:14:00 AM] <figure_04> The Amazons are a Prime group.
[06/1/17, 3:14:04 AM] <Bitgod> Is Paradise City on Paradise Island?
[06/1/17, 3:14:07 AM] <SighMartini> Anyone else feel that they were also made from clay but were left in the kiln to long?
[06/1/17, 3:14:12 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> @ToonEzon Matt did one at the opening. =P
[06/1/17, 3:14:18 AM] <Compel_Bast> @cinphoria I'm not saying the film/she is, but it's a complaint I'm surprised at not seeing
[06/1/17, 3:14:21 AM] <The_TBoyce> As much as I love Gal Gadot, I kind of liked Robin Wright as Diana's aunt.
[06/1/17, 3:14:23 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @DeLevely But who wouldn't! He should do an omaze
[06/1/17, 3:14:37 AM] <EmperorMoley> who cares about Wonder Woman when there is potato to discuss?
[06/1/17, 3:14:39 AM] <cinphoria> Maybe because we know she isn't :P
[06/1/17, 3:14:43 AM] <ToonEzon> @HydroSnail_RyanGreen fair enough, it was a tiny one though
[06/1/17, 3:14:47 AM] <soap_lady7> Lynda Carter should have played Hippolyta
[06/1/17, 3:14:49 AM] <stargazer1977> It's hard not to love Robin Wright, she's a wonderful actress.
[06/1/17, 3:15:00 AM] <soap_lady7> Steve Trevor
[06/1/17, 3:15:02 AM] <cinphoria> but yes I am also surprised by the lack of stupidity in this particular arena because I have low expectations of the world

[06/1/17, 3:15:10 AM] <sp_acevex> QUESTION: wonder woman vs batman vs superman, who wins?
[06/1/17, 3:15:12 AM] <DeLevely> So is there a parthenogenesis thing happening prior to his arrival?
[06/1/17, 3:15:18 AM] <G03933> Steve Trevor, most original guy name
