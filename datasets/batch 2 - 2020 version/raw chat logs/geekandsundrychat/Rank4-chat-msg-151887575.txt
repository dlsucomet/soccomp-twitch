[06/15/17, 3:01:54 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> @Cript_Keeper Recommend watching Star Trek Deep Space Nine, but I don't think it'll be necessary. Like you could enjoy the Doctor Who RPG without an encyclopedic knowledge of DW. ;)
[06/15/17, 3:01:56 AM] <Cript_Keeper> @shandravdeg, I will give it a go as i love Eric's DM style

[06/15/17, 3:03:02 AM] <Bitgod> Talesin has her amazing lipstick, I'm sure :p
[06/15/17, 3:03:09 AM] <theotherkiran> let's be honest Taliesin for sure has the lipstick and glasses he jsut doesn't wear them.
[06/15/17, 3:03:09 AM] <1uniqueBeast> JODY! You're awesome and beautiful. I'm a Faith fan.
[06/15/17, 3:03:12 AM] <ficklefandoms> oops Houser
[06/15/17, 3:03:16 AM] <lark7911> LOVE the faith chalk art!
[06/15/17, 3:03:18 AM] <derekleeketchum> i feel conflicted because i know I'm still instinctively gonna look for Jody in the chat despite knowing she on the show :p
[06/15/17, 3:03:28 AM] <Andyinsomnia> I feel like Tal could rock those glasses and lipstick if he wanted to
[06/15/17, 3:03:32 AM] <sp_acevex> hey yall
[06/15/17, 3:03:33 AM] <My_left_knee> Matt's t-shirt is awesome.
[06/15/17, 3:03:49 AM] <Bitgod> oh noes, this is seeing how the sausage is made
[06/15/17, 3:03:51 AM] <DocBarkey> @shantup yeah - same here. Legendary moved all the originally night schedule lineup to day shows, which caused all the hosts and viewers to adjust their schedules, and now it's all moving back to night. /shrug
[06/15/17, 3:03:53 AM] <runningfool11> omg yes! ive been needing this episode do much!
[06/15/17, 3:04:06 AM] <japenrose> Cool!
[06/15/17, 3:04:10 AM] <hero142> yes
[06/15/17, 3:04:18 AM] <stano430> lol
[06/15/17, 3:04:25 AM] <JJ_Dane> If it's a great quote, it's probably Gail Simone
[06/15/17, 3:04:30 AM] <starpilotsix> QUESTION: Do you have a good rule of thumb for figuring out how much "story" you can fit in a page or issue?
[06/15/17, 3:04:51 AM] <darkofnate> Speaking of Gail Simone, what was she doing at GNS this week?
[06/15/17, 3:04:52 AM] <Zaaroc> Feels weird that's there's only 2 more Wednesday Clubs that I'll be able to catch live T_T
[06/15/17, 3:04:58 AM] <japenrose> QUESTION: Any tips for editing comics/comic writers' work?
[06/15/17, 3:05:28 AM] <MeleeCharm> Hello everyone!
[06/15/17, 3:05:34 AM] <Splattercatt> No Jody... Do NOT teach chat how to Pun!!
[06/15/17, 3:05:34 AM] <zathyr> A .. pune?
[06/15/17, 3:05:40 AM] <JJ_Dane> Learning so much already!
[06/15/17, 3:05:46 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> QUESTION: Will you give a shoutout to your european fans, before you switch schedule, so we can't watch anymore?
[06/15/17, 3:05:51 AM] <AntsDoesStuff> @Zathyr gandsLessthanthree gandsLessthanthree
[06/15/17, 3:06:41 AM] <japenrose> @Andrea_Cordes The switch is July 5th I believe
[06/15/17, 3:06:51 AM] <DeLevely> Comic books+professional roleplayer. Jody is living the actual dream.
[06/15/17, 3:06:51 AM] <Triamas> "my middle name is Opportunity and I came here to knock"
[06/15/17, 3:06:54 AM] <stano430> living the dream!
[06/15/17, 3:06:57 AM] <Bitgod> 28 months? We have leftover balloons for that!
[06/15/17, 3:06:58 AM] <Xaguaratricks> I'm sorry to talk but is Stefanei staying on geek and sundry?
[06/15/17, 3:07:04 AM] <Zaaroc> @japenrose Yup.. So 2 more live streams :X
[06/15/17, 3:07:09 AM] <Asrathiel2912> @Andrea_Cordes I'm European and still going to watch... may take some planning but totally worth it
[06/15/17, 3:07:09 AM] <mathemagician_> When did wednesday club move to? I missed it
[06/15/17, 3:07:16 AM] <japenrose> @DeLevely Sam! We missed you last week! Hope you're doing well!
[06/15/17, 3:07:18 AM] <derekleeketchum> Hi @delevely :D
[06/15/17, 3:07:21 AM] <Danoba> @Xaguaratricks Yes, Stef will still be on the channel.
[06/15/17, 3:07:22 AM] <JJ_Dane> Realistic goals are important. Not homeless, check, self-supporting, check :-)
[06/15/17, 3:07:25 AM] <DeLevely> Max Landis=the maddest hustle ever
[06/15/17, 3:07:26 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> It is, but it doesn't have to be no, just, eventually. It's switching from 8 pm london time to 3 am. @japenrose
[06/15/17, 3:07:32 AM] <Bitgod> @trailerparkgoth 7pm pacific starting july 5

[06/15/17, 3:07:38 AM] <DeLevely> Hi all! Yeah, my internet wasn't working last week, I missed you all so much!!
[06/15/17, 3:07:42 AM] <Ryuredwings> Question! How on earth do you even start getting into a business like this? It feel like it's this huge landscape that's impossible to know where to start and poke around in.
[06/15/17, 3:07:46 AM] <ShandraVdeG> can i get the clubhouse link again?
[06/15/17, 3:07:46 AM] <khrister> 9pm to 4 am here.
[06/15/17, 3:07:47 AM] <runningfool11> question: what do you suggest for building your portfolio? where should a potential comic writer start?
[06/15/17, 3:08:01 AM] <mathemagician_> aww, i cant watch live i have uni
[06/15/17, 3:08:06 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @Asrathiel2912 all the shows I watch at G&S are now at my local 4 am, so I might just have to get a new sleep schedule x.x
[06/15/17, 3:08:07 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Math Key
[06/15/17, 3:08:09 AM] <KBTibbs> That fanfic is called "Legit" look it up
[06/15/17, 3:08:12 AM] <ficklefandoms> wooo @iviarelle :D
[06/15/17, 3:08:16 AM] <Xaguaratricks> Thank you for telling meðŸ˜¬
[06/15/17, 3:08:16 AM] <japenrose> @Andrea_Cordes Ugh, I'm sorry. Well, all the more reason for that discord then!
[06/15/17, 3:08:22 AM] <starpilotsix> @DeLevely Hey Sam!
[06/15/17, 3:08:24 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> *Shocked gasp* Amy's NOT wearing her Wonder Woman hoodie today! The world has officially gone mad! *Sees Amy then immediately put on the hoodie just now before clicking the chat button* Oh thank the gods! Everything's back to normal. We're saved! :D
[06/15/17, 3:08:26 AM] <Critternation3000> hey jody amy and matt
[06/15/17, 3:08:31 AM] <DeLevely> Hi @starpilotsix !
[06/15/17, 3:08:41 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @andrea_cordes can i get the clubhouse link again?
[06/15/17, 3:08:43 AM] <DeLevely> Oh man, that Web 1.0 life!
[06/15/17, 3:08:45 AM] <AlmstHvn> congrats all fellow anniversary'ers
[06/15/17, 3:08:45 AM] <japenrose> Whoo!
[06/15/17, 3:08:45 AM] <Asrathiel2912> @Andrea_Cordes That's my plan :P Sleep at odd hours in the future... gonna be 3am here
[06/15/17, 3:08:47 AM] <Triamas> I remember that reference
[06/15/17, 3:08:50 AM] <Ossborn> Yeah, for Europeans it will need more planning again, just like before the 12 PM schedule change..... I may return to the old schedule, watching the first show for a bit, then sleep, and watch the rebroadcast.... except for Mines & Crafts, Game The Game and GYP... those still will be live shows from start to finish for me
[06/15/17, 3:08:50 AM] <japenrose> Internet history!
[06/15/17, 3:08:57 AM] <KBTibbs> I'm so glad Jody knows web rings. That's a lost bit of internet culture.
[06/15/17, 3:09:01 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @japenrose absolutely! We are talking about planned rewatch at the old time xD
[06/15/17, 3:09:05 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @ShandraVdeG https://discord.gg/zRgz6F
[06/15/17, 3:09:08 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @delevely This makes me feel old.... i remember webrings
[06/15/17, 3:09:37 AM] <sp_acevex> @andrea_cordes i can't wait to have new people flood the discord
[06/15/17, 3:09:38 AM] <khrister> I remember the web before webrings...
[06/15/17, 3:09:40 AM] <Zaaroc> @Ossborn Thing is, just being able to watch vods without waking up at 3 am is a tad.. sad T_T
[06/15/17, 3:09:45 AM] <khrister> And the internet before the web
[06/15/17, 3:09:59 AM] <Triamas> my web site was in a web ring
[06/15/17, 3:10:02 AM] <DeLevely> Jody showed us some of her webcomic on Saturday. It's AMAZING
[06/15/17, 3:10:10 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> YOU ARE ALL VERY WELCOME AT OUR WEDNESDAY CLUBHOUSE! https://discord.gg/zRgz6F
[06/15/17, 3:10:20 AM] <Andrea_Cordes> @ahsokagrey yeah, same xD

[06/15/17, 3:10:42 AM] <iviarelle> @DeLevely Amazing-amazing, or "so gloriously a product of its time" amazing?
[06/15/17, 3:10:42 AM] <japenrose> Yup, yup, very LA
