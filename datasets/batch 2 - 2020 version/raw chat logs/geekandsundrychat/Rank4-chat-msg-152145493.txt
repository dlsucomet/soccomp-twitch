[06/16/17, 5:37:21 AM] <davidflegel> She plays the most aggressive male dwarf in the Dungeons and Dragons world.
[06/16/17, 5:37:30 AM] <Ossborn> I know that Ivan surely didnt have the time for it, but it´s a shame he wasnt on Hypers Death From Above on that friday, as OpfOr :-D
[06/16/17, 5:37:40 AM] <Shadowner> but now GtG is moving...
[06/16/17, 5:37:50 AM] <Fu4ow> ohhh she was the bearded dwarf??

[06/16/17, 5:37:54 AM] <Fu4ow> couldn't recognize her
[06/16/17, 5:38:00 AM] <Andyinsomnia> This show has on megastars such as Becca Scott of the famous series How to with Becca
[06/16/17, 5:38:10 AM] <Dolemite89> Becca improves games with new rules :)
[06/16/17, 5:38:16 AM] <november23> Becca isn't cheating she is playing Calvin Ball.

[06/16/17, 5:38:33 AM] <DeusPravus> Let me guess, Becca doesn't want returnees who won back on the show
[06/16/17, 5:39:08 AM] <davidflegel> I played this game before. I want to see if it is actually possible to win
[06/16/17, 5:39:13 AM] <Compel_Bast> Jonathan doesn't want to get on Becca's bad side
[06/16/17, 5:39:25 AM] <Kabukiman74> I'm still waiting for the "How to cheat like Becca" episode of "How to with Becca"...^^
[06/16/17, 5:39:30 AM] <kklenko> It's definitely possible to win.
[06/16/17, 5:39:34 AM] <DeusPravus> Wait, who approved Becca as a doctor in the first place?

[06/16/17, 5:40:15 AM] <november23> If Becca was a doctor she would be of the Frankenstein variety

[06/16/17, 5:40:24 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Becca can do a lot of things paint, take care of plants and build a table, so why not a doctor?

[06/16/17, 5:40:53 AM] <ravensburgermaster> "specialist" in what?
[06/16/17, 5:40:54 AM] <Davecom3> Becca believes she is the specialest...

[06/16/17, 5:44:35 AM] <VirginMaryZombieAttack> I am in Bizarro world!

[06/16/17, 5:45:31 AM] <Therealwyldride> A "Becca Cheat Cam" would be misnamed since all it would do is prove she never, ever cheats.
