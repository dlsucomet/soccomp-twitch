[06/16/17, 10:25:37 AM] <Dmtbassist> What would happen if Scanlan were to draw the card that gave you a proficiency bonus from the deck of many things?
[06/16/17, 10:25:38 AM] <Hathcyn> @Gotrek65 They will probably bring up multiple views when Matt is done narrating the previous
[06/16/17, 10:25:39 AM] <TheFruityKiwi> hey hoomans! Please RT to help find a missing twitch creator! Not seen since the Twitch mixer last night at #E3 she is a critter so lets find her! https://twitter.com/ashleeeeean/status/875499496507035648

[06/16/17, 10:26:01 AM] <Miraclesnow> Is it possible to put up a second camera for both sides of the table? I miss being able to see all the cast and the DM at the same time.
[06/16/17, 10:26:03 AM] <azurabrozee> Is there not a triple camera setup? Watching the players react to Matt's storytelling was always fun to watch
