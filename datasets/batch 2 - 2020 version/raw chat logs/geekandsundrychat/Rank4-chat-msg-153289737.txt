[06/21/17, 9:38:48 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> oh man, I could imagine the trouble they could enjoy making if they had green screens, if nothing else, just for pre-show times like this
[06/21/17, 9:38:50 AM] <LokiStark666> Me too I love behind the scenes stuff
[06/21/17, 9:38:51 AM] <Real_DonaldDuck> He's a dead shot

[06/21/17, 9:38:56 AM] <EyraKelalani> I wonder how Talks will change with the new campaign. Anyone heard plans from Brian/Matt/G&S?
[06/21/17, 9:38:57 AM] <gemdragyn> Bidet from Bethlehem PA
[06/21/17, 9:39:05 AM] <Psilio> kind of makes sense it has so many subscribers, compared to a single streamer with his or her PC as the only tool :)
[06/21/17, 9:39:16 AM] <Iwillgotohell2> @SpeedDemonStar oh dude, it had a bunch of stuff... like chicken and... meat... english is not my first language so idk a lot of food names
[06/21/17, 9:39:30 AM] <emmafrost91> Bidet From the UK
[06/21/17, 9:39:33 AM] <ToonEzon> it took a bit of work, but I was able to come up with some candy/cake based "thank my guests" names
[06/21/17, 9:39:37 AM] <oh_bother> I have a couple webcams and a tortured copy of OBS, but this stuff, and all the space for it, ung, and all those lighting toys, so good
[06/21/17, 9:39:39 AM] <Psilio> lots of good streamers of that kind as well, though, by all means, but this channel is certainly different
[06/21/17, 9:40:04 AM] <skillfulway> bidet from PA
[06/21/17, 9:40:05 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @Iwillgotohell2 sounds pretty good
[06/21/17, 9:40:12 AM] <oh_bother> is it the same equipment all day, I wonder
[06/21/17, 9:40:22 AM] <Tilir_> its starting in 20 minutes?
[06/21/17, 9:40:26 AM] <LokiStark666> So i havn't been able to watch any talks machina so far, is a new campaign confirmed? Do we know how much is left of this one?
[06/21/17, 9:40:26 AM] <Kerviel_> where are all the audio pros from chat during CR now to see how professional and complex this set up is for when they *** about the audio\
[06/21/17, 9:40:34 AM] <Psilio> they use different studios, i think
[06/21/17, 9:40:36 AM] <ToonEzon> Toffee slim-jim Jaffa cakes
