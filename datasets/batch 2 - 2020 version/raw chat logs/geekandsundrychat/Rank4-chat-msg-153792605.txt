[06/23/17, 10:14:03 AM] <TheDiMono> G&S keeps their audio levels a little lower than most other channels so that when people yell it doesn't peak out. You can always turn it up on your end ;)

[06/23/17, 10:16:03 AM] <star_graff> The reason they have the actor's names in the intro instead of the character names is so characters can die or be replaced and the intro still makes sense.
