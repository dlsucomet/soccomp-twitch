[06/28/17, 9:30:48 AM] <br8den> many
[06/28/17, 9:31:02 AM] <Crushter> @jimmy_eat_meatloaf If Scanlan said so during the moment, I would've let him ask and checked distance, cause he thought of it at the appropriate time
[06/28/17, 9:31:04 AM] <KitMarcus> Crushter The Raven Queen has said that Vax, Fate-Touched, affects the threads around him. Specifically his family.

[06/28/17, 9:31:10 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal its fun to play dumb, but it gets tiering after a while
[06/28/17, 9:31:11 AM] <TheDiMono> Preshow is up
[06/28/17, 9:31:14 AM] <kadenjahusk> All the theories!
[06/28/17, 9:31:16 AM] <skydor21> hi all
[06/28/17, 9:31:16 AM] <Rogue_13> heh, Grog would like to QB!
[06/28/17, 9:31:17 AM] <SereneLily> i mean clearly critical role is scripted Kappa #Sarcasm
[06/28/17, 9:31:22 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> would you guys like Vax reincarnated as a true paladin ?
[06/28/17, 9:31:24 AM] <skydor21> lol nice pic of travis
[06/28/17, 9:31:25 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal i think that travis will play a spellcaster after grog
[06/28/17, 9:31:28 AM] <Savulcan> Anyone know why Travis is faceswapped with Carson Wentz?
[06/28/17, 9:31:31 AM] <Go_Alxander> lol.. travis pic
[06/28/17, 9:31:33 AM] <lectricseal> @painkillior true
[06/28/17, 9:31:44 AM] <kadenjahusk> @jimmy_eat_meatloaf not how it works
[06/28/17, 9:31:48 AM] <TheDiMono> @Savulcan Because Liam wouldn't have made sense
[06/28/17, 9:31:49 AM] <Dragonchrome> I wonder if the Fate Touched element will come into play, or if that moment has passed
[06/28/17, 9:31:55 AM] <br8den> Travis has been amazing in the one off games.
[06/28/17, 9:31:58 AM] <lectricseal> @painkillior god id love to see Travis play a rogue again tbh
[06/28/17, 9:32:02 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> @Kadenjahusk regardless how it works, what about the narrative?
[06/28/17, 9:32:02 AM] <ledce83> Reincarnate doesn't change the class. Only the race. Potentially.
[06/28/17, 9:32:05 AM] <oh_bother> bahahaha wait what's the PA connection here with torvis welding rod
[06/28/17, 9:32:06 AM] <Zethyr> when does talks start?
[06/28/17, 9:32:06 AM] <skydor21> vax better come back
[06/28/17, 9:32:07 AM] <Roidzlawl> talks machina in 30 mins?
[06/28/17, 9:32:08 AM] <br8den> yes]
[06/28/17, 9:32:12 AM] <Vensris> First time I can watch live because I finally caught up :D
[06/28/17, 9:32:14 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal man he was SOOO GOOOD
[06/28/17, 9:32:14 AM] <AromiaFlyce> sighs
[06/28/17, 9:32:21 AM] <AromiaFlyce> oh man travis is gonna be piiiiissed
[06/28/17, 9:32:22 AM] <Dragonchrome> Talks starts in about 30 mins
[06/28/17, 9:32:24 AM] <Solangel777> I got my solar lenses for the Eclipse this august! I am so stoked!
[06/28/17, 9:32:25 AM] <rae816> Bidet from Boston!
[06/28/17, 9:32:25 AM] <Roidzlawl> last week was intense af
[06/28/17, 9:32:27 AM] <Crushter> Yeah but him being fate touch can just mean they're all meant to slay Vecna (also Gods lie to their servants)
[06/28/17, 9:32:28 AM] <CriticalRoleFan12> cant wait for this to start
[06/28/17, 9:32:28 AM] <Savulcan> @DiMono True enough, although its well known that the Cowboys and Eagles are not the best of friends
[06/28/17, 9:32:34 AM] <Tjohnholmes> Starts at 7 right?
[06/28/17, 9:32:36 AM] <Dragonchrome> Talks Machina is on every Tuesday 7pm - 8pm PDT on twitch.tv/geekandsundryhttp://www.wheniscriticalrole.com/talksmachina
[06/28/17, 9:32:38 AM] <AromiaFlyce> going to go start some dinner
[06/28/17, 9:32:40 AM] <Dragonchrome> !clock
[06/28/17, 9:32:40 AM] <Nightbot> It is currently 6:32 PM at the Geek & Sundry studio in California.
[06/28/17, 9:32:41 AM] <kadenjahusk> @jimmy_eat_meatloaf I highly doubt Matt would allow Liam to completely restat his character just for narrative.
[06/28/17, 9:32:42 AM] <lectricseal> @painkillior right???? That one shot really showed how well he can actually play
[06/28/17, 9:32:42 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal but i would like to see him play a wizard tbh
[06/28/17, 9:32:48 AM] <Savulcan> @DiMono that whole division rivalry thing, nearly as bad as the redskins.
[06/28/17, 9:32:54 AM] <br8den> If they used that strange skull they have been lugging around with a deamon in it they get a wish.
[06/28/17, 9:32:57 AM] <professor_nutsack> Is that picture real..
[06/28/17, 9:32:59 AM] <misplacedtexan93> omfg is that travis?!?!
[06/28/17, 9:33:02 AM] <kadenjahusk> @Crushter We still don't know that for sure.
[06/28/17, 9:33:02 AM] <scrubbalotus> wooo im awake for a talks finally this is my second talks iv seen
[06/28/17, 9:33:04 AM] <TheDiMono> I think Marisha's next character will be a non-spellcaster
[06/28/17, 9:33:09 AM] <quietalien_> Who's going to be on this one?
[06/28/17, 9:33:15 AM] <ArchonNocturnal> bidet from the UK
[06/28/17, 9:33:17 AM] <KitMarcus> br8den the Gith-Yanki? Nopenopenope.
[06/28/17, 9:33:17 AM] <zekeVSthordak> HOW DARE YOU DO THAT TO TRAVIS!
[06/28/17, 9:33:17 AM] <Danenglore> do we know who is on tonight
[06/28/17, 9:33:25 AM] <murasaur> LOL that pic
[06/28/17, 9:33:25 AM] <ledce83> They don't have the skull anymore, pretty sure they sent that away with Allura.
[06/28/17, 9:33:25 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal its sucks that he is so restricted by grogs int
[06/28/17, 9:33:26 AM] <legionlima> Beep beep @Karraxx
[06/28/17, 9:33:27 AM] <Crushter> @br8den It's a Githyenki actually, which in the grand scheme of things, isn't actually that bad
[06/28/17, 9:33:30 AM] <ayaserpentine> I hope Marisha plays a monk character
[06/28/17, 9:33:31 AM] <zekeVSthordak> I'm appauled
[06/28/17, 9:33:34 AM] <Terron79> Travis, Marisha, Ashley, and Matt
[06/28/17, 9:33:35 AM] <Dragonchrome> Our guests this Tuesday are Travis twitter.com/WillingBlam , Marisha twitter.com/Marisha_Ray , and Ashley twitter.com/thevulcansalute and Matt twitter.com/matthewmercer and Hosted by Brian Wayne Foster twitter.com/BrianWFoster to discuss episode 102.
[06/28/17, 9:33:36 AM] <kadenjahusk> @Danenglore they announce it on twitter
[06/28/17, 9:33:37 AM] <Danenglore> lol that is hilarious
[06/28/17, 9:33:40 AM] <Solangel777> @TheDiMono i wouldnt blame her. After playing a wizard my current character is a monk
[06/28/17, 9:33:40 AM] <thewoomandonly> Maybe Travis would actually make my birds better. I have much of a love/hate relationship with my local team to the east
[06/28/17, 9:33:41 AM] <LoudBiscuits> He gonna be pissssed lol
[06/28/17, 9:33:42 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal but when he plays he is amazing
[06/28/17, 9:33:46 AM] <ResearchDump> Mercer needs to run a different game for the next campaign.
[06/28/17, 9:33:46 AM] <skydor21> what up critters
[06/28/17, 9:33:46 AM] <puppetmasterkat> Bidet from Australia!!!
[06/28/17, 9:33:49 AM] <zekeVSthordak> Eagles Suck
[06/28/17, 9:33:51 AM] <Shiny_Noivern> looks like Travis is trapped behind an invisible wall and is trying to break out with a football
[06/28/17, 9:33:52 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> you know what's worse than this? Putting Travis' face on Eli Manning's body
[06/28/17, 9:33:57 AM] <lectricseal> @painkillior I know, Travis seems to have so much that he wants to add. It he has to really hold back
[06/28/17, 9:33:59 AM] <Crushter> I still think matt making travis roll for the scoll was a bit nyeh
[06/28/17, 9:34:02 AM] <MJasonO> Lol Travis is gonna hate it!
[06/28/17, 9:34:04 AM] <kadenjahusk> @Shiny_Noivern LOL
[06/28/17, 9:34:12 AM] <skydor21> puppetmasterkat: AUSTRALIA!
[06/28/17, 9:34:15 AM] <Crushter> (skull)
[06/28/17, 9:34:18 AM] <Savulcan> @thewoomandonly keep the faith, I have a good feeling about this year!
[06/28/17, 9:34:18 AM] <TheDiMono> My friend is going to start a game this summer that I'm going to be in, and I want to play a monk who won't kill. Specifically to set up a character moment when he inevitably gets a kill at some point
[06/28/17, 9:34:19 AM] <kadenjahusk> @Crushter what are you referring to?
[06/28/17, 9:34:25 AM] <onetearfalls> is free denise still a thing
[06/28/17, 9:34:29 AM] <kadenjahusk> @Crushter oh the skull? When
[06/28/17, 9:34:30 AM] <onetearfalls> ?
[06/28/17, 9:34:31 AM] <Crushter> I meant the skull
[06/28/17, 9:34:32 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal i know!! you could see it on his face
[06/28/17, 9:34:36 AM] <ResearchDump> I'd like to see a future punk style game for the next campaign similar to Roleplay Mirrorshades
[06/28/17, 9:34:38 AM] <kadenjahusk> @onetearfalls I don't think denise is here anymre
[06/28/17, 9:34:40 AM] <Mobius___> denise is free onetearfalls
[06/28/17, 9:34:41 AM] <rae816> denise is free
[06/28/17, 9:34:41 AM] <legionlima> Denise has been free'd
[06/28/17, 9:34:44 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> Bidet from Oklahoma!!
[06/28/17, 9:34:44 AM] <br8den> Denise is free... and gone.
[06/28/17, 9:34:45 AM] <zekeVSthordak> You are a terrible person Brian Wayne Foster, just terrible
[06/28/17, 9:34:46 AM] <Dragonchrome> Hi @TheDiMono
[06/28/17, 9:34:46 AM] <spacecakez69> how long till it starts?
[06/28/17, 9:34:47 AM] <professor_nutsack> @TheDiMono Suplex many a fiend for me, friend.
[06/28/17, 9:34:50 AM] <onetearfalls> :(
[06/28/17, 9:34:51 AM] <KitMarcus> Sainner There will be several one-shots between the end of Vox Machina and the start of the new campaign
[06/28/17, 9:34:53 AM] <loganschlieghliegh> Travis in an Eagles uniform is just plain wrong
[06/28/17, 9:34:55 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal he still adds some really cool ideas tbh, from time to time
[06/28/17, 9:34:55 AM] <TheDiMono> Hi @Dragonchrome
[06/28/17, 9:35:00 AM] <Crushter> Matt made him roll for the skull to spike it into the ground, as a barbarian with like 18 or 20 strength at the time
[06/28/17, 9:35:01 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> Denise is free
[06/28/17, 9:35:02 AM] <MJasonO> Bidet from Atl GA
[06/28/17, 9:35:03 AM] <kadenjahusk> @spacecakez69 about 25 minutes
[06/28/17, 9:35:07 AM] <empty_grim> Man when did they draft travis? looks like he will be missing a few thursday huh? ;P
[06/28/17, 9:35:11 AM] <br8den> Now we need to free Brian... let the ankel bracelet go.
[06/28/17, 9:35:14 AM] <spacecakez69> @kadenjahusk thx buddy
[06/28/17, 9:35:14 AM] <Savulcan> @loganschlieghliegh you think they'll tell him?
[06/28/17, 9:35:15 AM] <kadenjahusk> Bidet from Leesburg, VA
[06/28/17, 9:35:17 AM] <Saxman73> LUL Travis on the Eagles LUL
[06/28/17, 9:35:23 AM] <thewoomandonly> @Savulcan Honestly, I'm thinking a change to either Baltimore, or West coast with Seattle
[06/28/17, 9:35:26 AM] <kadenjahusk> @spacecakez69 no prob
[06/28/17, 9:35:26 AM] <bordirlathalas> lol
[06/28/17, 9:35:26 AM] <Mobius___> Long time viewer, first time caller, I love your show
[06/28/17, 9:35:27 AM] <Gh0stgato> Bidet!
[06/28/17, 9:35:30 AM] <remuladgryta> @TheDiMono depending on how you play that, it can either be really awesome or super annoying for the rest of the players.
[06/28/17, 9:35:31 AM] <Dragonchrome> you can follow Denise on her Twitch https://www.twitch.tv/denisebrr she has been freed
[06/28/17, 9:35:38 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> Oh, no. The anklet is by court order.
[06/28/17, 9:35:39 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> what's the name of the guy who just walked by?
[06/28/17, 9:35:46 AM] <ResearchDump> @KitMarcus I'm just saying, I think the campaign itself shouldn't be traditional 5E unless they plan on playing it with the new zone releases or something
[06/28/17, 9:35:49 AM] <Garthunox> hey, this is on in 25 minutes right or am I getting my timezones confused again?
[06/28/17, 9:35:49 AM] <loganschlieghliegh> they should have put him in a 49ers uniform. HAHAHA
[06/28/17, 9:35:53 AM] <chubbsthegreat1> steve
[06/28/17, 9:35:59 AM] <TheDiMono> @remuladgryta He won't be preachy, he just will never use lethal force. Until he accidentally does at one point, and has to deal with that
[06/28/17, 9:35:59 AM] <br8den> I think it is a joke. The ankel bracelet
[06/28/17, 9:36:07 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @Garthunox you're correct
[06/28/17, 9:36:11 AM] <scrubbalotus> see alota team nostream here ^_^ Bidet
[06/28/17, 9:36:13 AM] <zekeVSthordak> Travis is gonna Suge Knight Brian for this like he's Vanilla Ice
[06/28/17, 9:36:17 AM] <Savulcan> @Garthunox assuming an on time start you are on point with the timezones
[06/28/17, 9:36:27 AM] <legionlima> @Garthunox Yea 25min or so
[06/28/17, 9:36:43 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal i was really hoping that he would pull out the deck when he was alone
[06/28/17, 9:36:48 AM] <kadenjahusk> If they REALLY wanted to piss Travis off they'd put him in a Redskins uniform.
[06/28/17, 9:36:49 AM] <owifig> Is that Travis as a football player saying Live Long & Prosper? That is one layered picture there...
[06/28/17, 9:36:49 AM] <PinkRanger33> gandsDrink :D
[06/28/17, 9:36:56 AM] <Dragonchrome> that's a spicy football
[06/28/17, 9:37:01 AM] <remuladgryta> @TheDiMono then you'll have to ask yourself if destroying undead is using lethal force or not, given that they are already dead. OpieOP
[06/28/17, 9:37:01 AM] <loganschlieghliegh> who's on tonight
[06/28/17, 9:37:08 AM] <CriticalRoleFan12> i cant wait for this it starts in about 25min at 9 on the east side
[06/28/17, 9:37:12 AM] <lectricseal> @painkillior same. I thought he was a turn or so away from starting to panic and start ripping all the cards out
[06/28/17, 9:37:16 AM] <KitMarcus> Sainner they're playing in a custom-made world created by Mercer. I think that's a bit more...interesting than anything WotC puts out.
[06/28/17, 9:37:25 AM] <Dragonchrome> Our guests this Tuesday are Travis twitter.com/WillingBlam , Marisha twitter.com/Marisha_Ray , and Ashley twitter.com/thevulcansalute and Matt twitter.com/matthewmercer and Hosted by Brian Wayne Foster twitter.com/BrianWFoster to discuss episode 102.
[06/28/17, 9:37:29 AM] <TheDiMono> @remuladgryta That would be returning the dead to their rightful state, and thus okay
[06/28/17, 9:37:29 AM] <Garthunox> @owifig I think its just meant to be a wave, the ring and pinky arent touching
[06/28/17, 9:37:29 AM] <Savulcan> ^
[06/28/17, 9:37:31 AM] <ResearchDump> I'm going to go heat up like 8 pounds of pasta so I can lay in bed and funnel food directly into my innards like a savage
[06/28/17, 9:37:35 AM] <legionlima> Hope Liam is on i wanna see his reaction
[06/28/17, 9:37:37 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> @lectricseal that episode was too intense
[06/28/17, 9:37:42 AM] <ResearchDump> @KitMarcus Custom is good
[06/28/17, 9:37:48 AM] <kadenjahusk> @KitMarcus I like how he's incorporating WotC stuff into his world though.
[06/28/17, 9:37:54 AM] <Savulcan> @legionlima No Liam tonight :(
[06/28/17, 9:37:58 AM] <br8den> Girl on couch has tights that look like horrible flesh wounds when bury camera looks at them.
[06/28/17, 9:38:00 AM] <XavelX> who are the guest tonight?
[06/28/17, 9:38:02 AM] <Dragonchrome> Talks Machina is on every Tuesday 7pm - 8pm PDT on twitch.tv/geekandsundryhttp://www.wheniscriticalrole.com/talksmachina got about 24 mins to go
[06/28/17, 9:38:02 AM] <loganschlieghliegh> thanks @Dragonchrome
[06/28/17, 9:38:03 AM] <Vance1982> i doubt matt will let marisha use a full power true res, considering how much he hates the res spells in general
[06/28/17, 9:38:05 AM] <Garthunox> @legionlima Travis, Marisha, Ashley and Matt tonight
[06/28/17, 9:38:06 AM] <kadenjahusk> @KitMarcus I mean Vecna himself is a classic baddie.
[06/28/17, 9:38:08 AM] <ResearchDump> brb
[06/28/17, 9:38:14 AM] <Dragonchrome> np
[06/28/17, 9:38:17 AM] <edwardwcross> Omg..Travis as Wentz is hilarious. We fucking hate Cowboys fans in Philly
[06/28/17, 9:38:23 AM] <TheDiMono> @lectricseal I'm surprised he didn't hold his action to attack whatever got in range. That way, when he bamfed back, he could unload.
[06/28/17, 9:38:26 AM] <ledce83> I would be perfectly happy seeing another part of the world that they haven't already been to.
[06/28/17, 9:38:27 AM] <Savulcan> @Vance1982 let us dream man. let us dream.
[06/28/17, 9:38:30 AM] <thellamasc> @legionlima Travis, Marisha, Ashley, and Matt
[06/28/17, 9:38:32 AM] <BecauseMonks> so class baddie
[06/28/17, 9:38:33 AM] <hkoart> I'm assuming Matt isn't actually going to reveal whether True Res works in his rules tonight?
[06/28/17, 9:38:36 AM] <legionlima> Ohhh Matt's got some splainging to doooo
[06/28/17, 9:38:38 AM] <CrohnieOwnie> Finally was able to watch the madness of the episode last night. Boy Matt was make my sure Vax died. Lol
[06/28/17, 9:38:39 AM] <Mobius___> Vecna is such a bada$$ , when you pluck out his eye and chop off his hand, they become Artifacts
[06/28/17, 9:38:43 AM] <KitMarcus> kadenjahusk This is true. But I love the fact that Matt created a whole world to run around in.
[06/28/17, 9:38:46 AM] <TheDiMono> @legionlima How so?
[06/28/17, 9:38:47 AM] <Garthunox> Although I do wanna see what Matt wanted to discuss
[06/28/17, 9:38:54 AM] <ToonEzon> Bidet and beep beep
[06/28/17, 9:38:54 AM] <Garthunox> True Res is an OP spell
[06/28/17, 9:38:56 AM] <maeleson> So is it wrong to quietly be hoping Vax is dead because on a meta level Liam needs time to prep a 2-3 month campaign for mercer to play in with the rest of the crew?
[06/28/17, 9:38:59 AM] <owifig> SWORD GUY!
[06/28/17, 9:39:01 AM] <Garthunox> But so is PWK
[06/28/17, 9:39:07 AM] <zenez8> @edwardwcross Cowboys Fans aren't too fond of Eagles fans either
[06/28/17, 9:39:08 AM] <kadenjahusk> @KitMarcus oh I cannot agree with you more.
[06/28/17, 9:39:11 AM] <Dragonchrome> Sword man has arrived
[06/28/17, 9:39:15 AM] <Garthunox> I hate PWK with a unholy amount of anger
[06/28/17, 9:39:15 AM] <ayaserpentine> All will be revealed tonight gandsOverlord gandsOverlord
[06/28/17, 9:39:15 AM] <DanceSchool> nvr been able to catch talks live :D super excited
[06/28/17, 9:39:16 AM] <synthaetic> Vax just needs to come back as a Revenant tbh.
[06/28/17, 9:39:18 AM] <scrubbalotus> lol Mobius
[06/28/17, 9:39:20 AM] <AromiaFlyce> i see him!
[06/28/17, 9:39:27 AM] <scire> A wild Sword Guy appears
[06/28/17, 9:39:29 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> I need names for all these people walking around the set
[06/28/17, 9:39:29 AM] <speedstreak> Omg that picture
[06/28/17, 9:39:31 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> I don't think Mercer would ban True Resurrection. But with something like that, a price would have to be paid, more than a normal Resurrection spell
[06/28/17, 9:39:34 AM] <gemdragyn> Bidet from Bethlehem PA
[06/28/17, 9:39:34 AM] <Mobius___> I think the biggest mistake, Percy dragging the corpse with them to the Feywild
[06/28/17, 9:39:34 AM] <completely_nobody> Why is Travis shopped into an Eagles uniform?
[06/28/17, 9:39:38 AM] <Aviat3> If i miss most of the beginning of the stream, will it be going up in the videos section after?
[06/28/17, 9:39:39 AM] <BecauseMonks> makes sense why they got beat up so bad...guys pretty much a god
[06/28/17, 9:39:40 AM] <Savulcan> @zenez8 that awkard moment where you have both in the same family. Thanksgivings are intense.
[06/28/17, 9:39:41 AM] <mjolly3> Bidet from Denver!

[06/28/17, 9:39:41 AM] <Dragonchrome> not everything can be revealed tonight, I am sure Matt has to keep some things under his hat
[06/28/17, 9:39:42 AM] <dodgerthirteen> tbh I normally don't watch Talks, but after last week's episode, I have to.
[06/28/17, 9:39:45 AM] <completely_nobody> I thought he hates The Redskins?
[06/28/17, 9:39:47 AM] <legionlima> @TheDiMono i just want to hear what he has to say about it is all, what the options are .... if he will allow a true res..
[06/28/17, 9:39:49 AM] <Gh0stgato> Matt already did a Redit about it
[06/28/17, 9:39:51 AM] <Hav3nsblade> Travis wishes he was a good QB Kappa
[06/28/17, 9:39:52 AM] <TheDiMono> Mercer never said he wouldn't allow True Res, he said they were going to have to talk about it
[06/28/17, 9:39:52 AM] <Cernem> h0w long?
[06/28/17, 9:39:53 AM] <owifig> Hi Eric Campbell!
[06/28/17, 9:39:59 AM] <Dragonchrome> @Aviat3 yes
[06/28/17, 9:40:02 AM] <kadenjahusk> @ThatGamerGrl He never said he'd ban spells, he'd just make stuff harder and he already has with is resurrection rules.
[06/28/17, 9:40:08 AM] <professor_nutsack> I want to see Orc Vex
[06/28/17, 9:40:09 AM] <Cernem> can somone link the reddit?
[06/28/17, 9:40:09 AM] <PAINKILLIOR> IS THAT DENIS ON THE LEFT?
[06/28/17, 9:40:10 AM] <NoNameNewt> @dodgerthirteen same dude
[06/28/17, 9:40:12 AM] <BecauseMonks> hates everyone in nfl south
[06/28/17, 9:40:13 AM] <ServinUpMeat> Hello, Friends!
[06/28/17, 9:40:13 AM] <TheDiMono> True Res requires the soul to be free and willing. Vax's soul isn't free, it's spoken for by the Raven Queen. And he may not be willing.
[06/28/17, 9:40:14 AM] <CasperTheIndignantGhost> Travis shopped into a Wentz photo? Sweet Philly justice.
[06/28/17, 9:40:16 AM] <Aviat3> @Dragonchrome cheers
[06/28/17, 9:40:18 AM] <yopie96> @Cernem Cl0ck
[06/28/17, 9:40:20 AM] <synthaetic> Is the audio skipping for someone else, too?
[06/28/17, 9:40:22 AM] <StormsOfShadow> Is the audio cutting out for anyone else?

[06/28/17, 9:40:24 AM] <Dragonchrome> about 20 mins till showtime
[06/28/17, 9:40:25 AM] <hkoart> True Rez is so OP i'd be glad if he made it harder
[06/28/17, 9:40:25 AM] <Mobius___> time for the Social media people to play around
[06/28/17, 9:40:25 AM] <br8den> Maybe Brian Foster will stand in with guest character for Vax until Ashley levels enough for true rez.
[06/28/17, 9:40:28 AM] <Aokuang_Xing_Lung> Aren't they supposed to be like setting up for the stream, lol
[06/28/17, 9:40:28 AM] <scrubbalotus> true rez should literally cost an arm and a leg
[06/28/17, 9:40:28 AM] <edwardwcross> No doubt Zenez, but Philly is a much meaner place than Dallas. They don't call it Philly Phlavor for nothing...I mean we SNOWBALLED SANTA with icey-laden snow during a game
[06/28/17, 9:40:33 AM] <KitMarcus> Yes, audio is skipping
[06/28/17, 9:40:35 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> Carson Wentz always looks like he's doing the Vulcan Salute.

[06/28/17, 9:40:36 AM] <kadenjahusk> Audio is skipping here.
