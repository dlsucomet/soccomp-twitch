[07/6/17, 10:13:14 AM] <CaptainTalon447> Just like generic trading cards?
[07/6/17, 10:13:14 AM] <r_syzygy> is that a Groot mug Amy's holding?
[07/6/17, 10:13:21 AM] <CaptainTalon447> There's no card game?
[07/6/17, 10:13:21 AM] <DragonsDusk> I sadly never had a ton that were straight up comic cards
[07/6/17, 10:13:24 AM] <onlysunlight> I wish I had caved and had pizza at lunch
[07/6/17, 10:13:26 AM] <TheDiMono> Nope, it's Groot's actual disembodied head
[07/6/17, 10:13:27 AM] <super390> I actually followed Amy to this channel in 2015, so I welcome her takeover.
[07/6/17, 10:13:34 AM] <sudakushi> OMG it's my favorite ppl how is everyone doing today
[07/6/17, 10:13:38 AM] <Tarthus> I still have the normal cards and I think two holograms, but I'm missing...three holograms, I think.
[07/6/17, 10:13:40 AM] <DEATHlikescats> hey WOMStv its weird, but not WEIRD. I am watching via my PS and for some reason my chat texts aren't going through, but here on my laptop, they are.
[07/6/17, 10:13:40 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @r_syzygy Yup! :)
[07/6/17, 10:13:42 AM] <Frilner> I find it sort of incredible that these people have managed to keep their friendships so tight over such a long period of time, its pretty awesome.
[07/6/17, 10:13:44 AM] <Saint_Doughboy> Kreygasm
[07/6/17, 10:13:46 AM] <lixyewup> Jody putting everyone to shame.

[07/6/17, 10:13:54 AM] <darkofnate> God, I wonder what happened to my old Marvel cards
