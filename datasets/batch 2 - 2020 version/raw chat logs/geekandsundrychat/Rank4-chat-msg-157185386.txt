[07/7/17, 10:24:07 AM] <ScaryGeauxst> I built this stream up from nothing. When I started, all I had was weak stream! Other streamers said I was daft to build a stream on dial-up, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em! It crashed into the void, so I built a second one. That sank into the void. I built a third one. It burned down, fell over, and then it sank into the void. But the fourth one stayed up! And that's what you're going to get, lad--the strongest stream on these lands!
[07/7/17, 10:24:08 AM] <ufa19> Finally working! Thanks crew!
