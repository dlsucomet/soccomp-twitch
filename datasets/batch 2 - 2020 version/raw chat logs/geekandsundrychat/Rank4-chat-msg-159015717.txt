[07/14/17, 2:34:50 PM] <Nightbot> Ashley Johnson, who plays Pike Trickfoot, is currently away shooting a tv show. It's called Blindspot and airs Mondays at 10/9 on NBC. The show shoots July-April/May, and is scheduled for a second season as well. But don't worry, she'll make special appearances here and there.

[07/14/17, 2:35:06 PM] <Jest118> Blindspot is filming again so not likely to get much Ashley until mid-season filming break.

[07/14/17, 2:36:46 PM] <Highbear1991> I missed it did they say no CR next week?
[07/14/17, 2:36:51 PM] <Dragonchrome> San Diego Comic Con Critter meet up at Conival linkhttps://www.facebook.com/events/490821451260385/
[07/14/17, 2:36:52 PM] <Art_forArts_Sake> usually the chat goes by I can barely get one message in before they turn on sub only chat
[07/14/17, 2:36:52 PM] <Jest118> Honestly, if you're watching the live show, it's best to just minimize the chat. The only thing you'll miss out on is the group "lol" stuff.
[07/14/17, 2:36:53 PM] <EdibleDragon> I watch fullscreen and the chat's usually moving too fast to read anyway
[07/14/17, 2:36:58 PM] <Danoba> No CR next week due to SDCC.
[07/14/17, 2:37:00 PM] <fajitasCommaNd> 1) i love CR. 2) they aren't doing it for free. they get paid for this and moreover they co-own Critical Role Productions, LLC. don't pretend this is a charity thing :( ...

[07/14/17, 2:39:46 PM] <Jest118> I believe this year, they're in the Con proper, so likely would need badges. As opposed to previous years where they were off-site at Petco
[07/14/17, 2:39:47 PM] <VolleyBallerAZ> @Dragonchrome The one you linked, critter meetup.

[07/14/17, 2:42:01 PM] <MysticAarrgg> Fruit...made from souls! Kappa
[07/14/17, 2:42:11 PM] <MissCeeAra> I love how telling people not to be a holes over something that's subjective means they're white knights lol They have to make quick decisions under pressure on a live show, people need to cut them some slack
[07/14/17, 2:42:11 PM] <VolleyBallerAZ> @Dragonchrome Thanks for checking!
[07/14/17, 2:42:12 PM] <DanielBittencourt_> @systemofadingus really? pls stay, you're in for a ride
