[07/19/17, 9:48:39 AM] <direpants97> itte faen om je sÃ¦v nÃ¥r det er Critical role!
[07/19/17, 9:48:43 AM] <akiwidm> so more of a reason for him to become a permanent member of vox machina?
[07/19/17, 9:48:46 AM] <NonDripHelmet> Are we in the internet?

[07/19/17, 9:48:54 AM] <gemdragyn> Bidet from PA
[07/19/17, 9:48:55 AM] <JC_Wijma> @Israfil93 It was shortly after the battle, and before they went to the library. He first says he can't remember his old party, and then mentions 3 or 4 of them by name. I'm sure of it.
[07/19/17, 9:49:01 AM] <Israfil93> @SpeedDemonStar dude, "didnÂ´t let us down" was damn close to a verbal abuse to that top notch oscar worthy peformance ;P <3
[07/19/17, 9:49:03 AM] <Dragonchrome> about 12 mins till go time
[07/19/17, 9:49:12 AM] <Dragonchrome> more or les
[07/19/17, 9:49:12 AM] <mogodontsocialize> i thought he already was @Cahnis :P
[07/19/17, 9:49:16 AM] <Arborhawk> it is obvious Darin will be bringing the class to the show tonight
[07/19/17, 9:49:24 AM] <canadianancientgamer> Anyone here catch GoT last night?? ðŸ˜®
[07/19/17, 9:49:27 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @akiwidm I think the main problem would be scheduling because I mean, look how long it took them to get him on the show in the first place
[07/19/17, 9:49:33 AM] <MalSpaceguy> If you came across Matt Mercer tied up in a dungeon would you make him DM for you once before letting him free?
[07/19/17, 9:49:35 AM] <Dolnor> Old is new again...been waiting for Seersucker and Pinstriped Suits to come back into fashion! -)
[07/19/17, 9:49:35 AM] <direpants97> yea!
[07/19/17, 9:49:39 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @Israfil93 pretty much
[07/19/17, 9:49:41 AM] <Cahnis> no GoT spoilers here please!

[07/19/17, 9:49:59 AM] <Cahnis> As a book reader I ll fight you if you spoil
[07/19/17, 9:50:10 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @MalSpaceguy No I'd let him free immediately and DM for him. :D
[07/19/17, 9:50:11 AM] <Israfil93> @NonDripHelmet everyone with a sane Mind wants that Kappa
[07/19/17, 9:50:12 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @MalSpaceguy nah, release him from the dungeon, take him to my own dungeon, THEN make him DM.
[07/19/17, 9:50:14 AM] <canadianancientgamer> No spoilers from me. But gods was it good!
[07/19/17, 9:50:16 AM] <Arborhawk> @Dragonchrome if not we RIOT!
[07/19/17, 9:50:20 AM] <mogodontsocialize> @MalSpaceguy but if you set him free, he might run for it
