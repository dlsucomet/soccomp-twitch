[07/20/17, 12:50:11 PM] <3TWO3ONE> more Amy please
[07/20/17, 12:50:13 PM] <cinphoria> We accidentally locked a door at work while working the night shift and couldn't reach anyone so I picked it with a bobby pin and a ballpoint pen cap
[07/20/17, 12:50:16 PM] <Davecom3> what did I miss watching Stef?
[07/20/17, 12:50:21 PM] <Danoba> I'm sorry you're in pain @Leigh574
[07/20/17, 12:50:31 PM] <FlavahText> "Lady Blue LIps" was my nickname in college... its not what you think
[07/20/17, 12:50:32 PM] <Floydie7> I think Liam actually has a lockpick set from a fan. Whether he knows how to use it is another matter.
[07/20/17, 12:50:34 PM] <Leigh574> @danoba thanks <3
[07/20/17, 12:50:35 PM] <cinphoria> At which time I voiced my concerns that our security is shit because I picked it in under 20 seconds
[07/20/17, 12:50:40 PM] <crthemighty> oh fie, that's an easy one, use a credit card *have totally opened doors that way*
[07/20/17, 12:50:42 PM] <Chovexani> Lady Blue Lips *phrasing* ?
[07/20/17, 12:50:52 PM] <TravisTheRed> Amy's hair looks awesome
[07/20/17, 12:50:52 PM] <chaoticloony> @Leigh574 At least you can see the bright side of the pain!
[07/20/17, 12:50:54 PM] <Zismarith> @Leigh574 Not the best compromise.
[07/20/17, 12:50:54 PM] <3TWO3ONE> lol #LBL
[07/20/17, 12:50:56 PM] <cinphoria> A strange door lock should've taken me AT LEAST 3 minutes
[07/20/17, 12:50:58 PM] <FlavahText> cream soda?
