[09/13/17, 9:39:45 AM] <postdataest> you should hear the music and see the 'behind the scenes' camera

[09/13/17, 9:42:53 AM] <FedorakJ> Does anyone make DnD characters they want to play but can't cause they have no one to play with?
[09/13/17, 9:43:00 AM] <FedorakJ> Or is that just me?
[09/13/17, 9:43:09 AM] <rasnac_khan> After all those weeks,
[09/13/17, 9:43:14 AM] <zaurevenyx> get on roll20, son
[09/13/17, 9:43:22 AM] <Oliinc14> I do but I'm afraid to join someone's group
[09/13/17, 9:43:25 AM] <Shiny_Noivern> @FedorakJ I do thatâ€¦
[09/13/17, 9:43:31 AM] <fabledfirbolg> I hope in the next campaign they have to use an airship and it is provided by the de Rolo company.
[09/13/17, 9:43:31 AM] <Jacicius> @FedorakJ have you tried to find people online? A lot of people play through roll20
[09/13/17, 9:43:33 AM] <f_day_fan> I now right we want Matt back but we want him to stay well so it is kind of a hard to say do we want him back if he is not well enough yet
[09/13/17, 9:43:38 AM] <Mosbaked> @FedorakJ I do that but becuase I have to DM instead lol
[09/13/17, 9:43:46 AM] <FedorakJ> I tried Roll20, like Poker it is a game I like playing in person. Online loses something for me
[09/13/17, 9:43:46 AM] <TheTygur> On this Talks: How they brought down the DM, winning D&D.
[09/13/17, 9:43:59 AM] <ElGuanoLoco> @FedorakJ I haven't made complete characters, but my head is full of backstories
[09/13/17, 9:44:07 AM] <Dr_sterben> Our airship destroys to much?? That is just how we, De Rolo...

[09/13/17, 9:44:49 AM] <FedorakJ> I tried setting up a game with me DMing. My players all suck and don't want to agree on a day to play so I just gave up
[09/13/17, 9:44:51 AM] <lupapuella> @FedorakJ I DM and am looking for players. Roll20 is ok, but a better service is just helping groups form.
[09/13/17, 9:45:05 AM] <KingSundew> wait? Is that old school trinket?

[09/13/17, 9:47:29 AM] <jaypetaljp> Bidet!
[09/13/17, 9:47:36 AM] <cosmosounder> No this isn't a rebroadcast
[09/13/17, 9:47:38 AM] <MrNY2Cali> @Shiny_Noivern you can find the basic players guide for DnD on the Wizards of the Coast website for basic character creation. D&D & its variants are what you make of it & no two games are the same. Very easy to pickup, its just using your imagination
[09/13/17, 9:47:42 AM] <cosmosounder> Different intro
[09/13/17, 9:47:58 AM] <fabledfirbolg> Combining shenanigans and tomfoolery to get Vox Machina
[09/13/17, 9:48:08 AM] <TheDiMono> That TalieSin picture is gold
[09/13/17, 9:48:29 AM] <Dr_sterben> pure gold.\
[09/13/17, 9:48:54 AM] <DarkVices> I can hear the theme song now.
[09/13/17, 9:49:12 AM] <MrNY2Cali> so is this talking Sam one shot, or talking Burning Man stories to make up for Mercer underweather thursday?
[09/13/17, 9:49:20 AM] <Qwuilleran> *waves*
[09/13/17, 9:49:24 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> cheetos?
[09/13/17, 9:49:29 AM] <master_ten_1750> It's too small - can't see it.
[09/13/17, 9:49:35 AM] <Dr_sterben> *om...nom*
[09/13/17, 9:49:35 AM] <TheDiMono> So it turns out my chicken broccoli casserole recipe is quickly improving. I approve of this.
[09/13/17, 9:49:42 AM] <action_gordon> Is that Dante from Clerks?
[09/13/17, 9:49:48 AM] <gemdragyn> episode 110
[09/13/17, 9:49:53 AM] <fabledfirbolg> @MrNY2CALI I think its gonna be a combo of everything tbh
[09/13/17, 9:49:58 AM] <Soulxryder> Bidet
[09/13/17, 9:49:58 AM] <DarkVices> Judging by the title below looks like they are talking the last story episode. So 110 where they climb into the titan
[09/13/17, 9:49:59 AM] <WDM1262> Talespin Jeffe!
[09/13/17, 9:50:11 AM] <Xayagami> a detailed report on matts condition
[09/13/17, 9:50:41 AM] <DarkVices> If he got lots of rest and saw a specialist he should be good, but maybe not 100%
[09/13/17, 9:50:51 AM] <DarkVices> Sciatica can take a while if it's bad
[09/13/17, 9:51:16 AM] <Endeecom> hi everyone
