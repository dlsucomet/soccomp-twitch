[09/21/17, 10:03:56 AM] <montanabilly> sassy
[09/21/17, 10:03:59 AM] <super390> I think Critical Role should be done this way so that Matt's back will be more comfortable.

[09/21/17, 10:04:55 AM] <PrimroseFrost> @super390 Problem would be moving the minis around a board, and I think that would be MORE uncomfortable.

[09/21/17, 10:06:33 AM] <orlliie> i'm definitely gonna buy the paperback but i'm also tempted to just buy the digital issues too
[09/21/17, 10:06:35 AM] <paladinish421> i am here to learn more about comic's. I love the characters and the creative story's and how you can say some much with so little but stupidly I always want them to be longer.
[09/21/17, 10:06:37 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> Don't think I don't see that great Conan art on the board behind you all! It's really good :)
[09/21/17, 10:06:38 AM] <Misty_Crom> The artwork is amazing, but... why isn't it Percy?

[09/21/17, 10:10:12 AM] <Dobby_der_Elf> the first npc sounded like matt in my head
[09/21/17, 10:10:15 AM] <rasnac_khan> I had high high expectations and the comic even exceeded that.
[09/21/17, 10:10:17 AM] <Vance1982> Talesin, off topic but if Percy encountered Starfleet How would percy react to a standard phaser rifle?
[09/21/17, 10:10:19 AM] <pSkinner> @GeekandSundry But will Tal's 1st character appear in the comic?
[09/21/17, 10:10:19 AM] <UncleOok> Tiberius is in the comic @ArgentumFlare
[09/21/17, 10:10:20 AM] <jubileee_> Well, now I have to go look that up lol
[09/21/17, 10:10:22 AM] <misssunflower94> Matt's current beard looks excellent
[09/21/17, 10:10:28 AM] <artistsomeday> The shade Taliesin!
[09/21/17, 10:10:28 AM] <halfaringcircus> The scruff is adorable.
[09/21/17, 10:10:29 AM] <ArgentumFlare> @japenrose Oh okay rad
[09/21/17, 10:10:32 AM] <TrueXarkos21> Naration card tease?
[09/21/17, 10:10:34 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Yup, I read the ENTIRE comic in everyone's voices......
[09/21/17, 10:10:41 AM] <waywardfrantz> matt made a full chain mail outfit, he is witcher every year
[09/21/17, 10:10:42 AM] <pyrotechnick777> talesin will we see your Dragonborn Paladin in the comic?
[09/21/17, 10:10:43 AM] <rasnac_khan> Matt said he won't cut his beard until the wedding.
[09/21/17, 10:10:44 AM] <meaningofnightt> @Ricky_Galletti it's on my twitter with the same handle if you'd like to see!
[09/21/17, 10:10:49 AM] <Vance1982> Shandra Same
[09/21/17, 10:10:49 AM] <owifig> Matt's beard is dead sexy right now
[09/21/17, 10:10:53 AM] <larilyon> Is Tibs really in there?
[09/21/17, 10:10:56 AM] <stargazer1977> Be careful when watching Talks Machina from yesterday, the ending that Matt Mercer says may make you pregnant just from watching it. Even if you are genetically male.
[09/21/17, 10:10:58 AM] <japenrose> Thank you for you all DOING this comic!
[09/21/17, 10:10:59 AM] <Real_DonaldDuck> Maw-Kin-Ah
[09/21/17, 10:11:00 AM] <misssunflower94> I want to read all of it in print right now and I'm dying
[09/21/17, 10:11:01 AM] <RMutt1917> There is totally a cow level Kappa
[09/21/17, 10:11:03 AM] <The_TBoyce> Matt said on Talks Machina that the characters had already met before the original one-shot, right? So they could avoid the whole "you meet in a tavern" thing?
[09/21/17, 10:11:11 AM] <UncleOok> Matt doesn't realize Vox Moochina is a real thing ("Cows & Consequences" & GenCon cosplay)
[09/21/17, 10:11:12 AM] <meaningofnightt> Your DnD game got a COMIC BOOK
[09/21/17, 10:11:17 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> Some one needs to tell Matt the cow episode...
[09/21/17, 10:11:18 AM] <artistsomeday> Taliesin's joy is palpable
[09/21/17, 10:11:20 AM] <Misty_Crom> I can't tell, is Taliesin excited?
[09/21/17, 10:11:24 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Yes, Taliesin, there will be comics of your D&D character, get used to it.
[09/21/17, 10:11:25 AM] <pagerunnerj> it's pretty damn sweet
[09/21/17, 10:11:26 AM] <japenrose> @larilyon He is!
[09/21/17, 10:11:28 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @meaningofnightt Nice. I'll check it out after the show :)
[09/21/17, 10:11:32 AM] <wadewilson1983> i really wish there were individual issues
[09/21/17, 10:11:40 AM] <tomservo544> I can't wait until the physical copies come out
[09/21/17, 10:11:44 AM] <voltron4200> will therr be a digital collected edition?
[09/21/17, 10:11:45 AM] <larilyon> :D
[09/21/17, 10:11:52 AM] <wadewilson1983> partly because i want blank sketch cover variants to get artists to work on them
[09/21/17, 10:11:54 AM] <Dobby_der_Elf> Will there be a live read by the cast at some point? that be amazing
[09/21/17, 10:11:55 AM] <mrdobolina> Great!
[09/21/17, 10:11:58 AM] <RMutt1917> next... a Future Girl comic? <3 #EnthusiArmy
[09/21/17, 10:12:04 AM] <dragonmustang01> taliesin geeking out about the comic is adorable
[09/21/17, 10:12:06 AM] <wadewilson1983> just think how many cool covers would happen with that
[09/21/17, 10:12:06 AM] <misssunflower94> I mean... is it not a genre?
[09/21/17, 10:12:11 AM] <misssunflower94> I think HP fic is a genre
[09/21/17, 10:12:13 AM] <Danoba> @stargazer1977 Oh you mean this? https://clips.twitch.tv/FineAbrasiveDootPunchTrees

[09/21/17, 10:12:13 AM] <AnimeStarkid23> i read the whole thing twice this morning after I brought it
[09/21/17, 10:12:18 AM] <Misty_Crom> I cannot begin to fathom the notion of my D&D game being in a comic book that people pay money to read. Even if gnome rangers are the best.
[09/21/17, 10:12:24 AM] <meaningofnightt> @RMutt1917 I would definitely support a Future Girl comic
[09/21/17, 10:12:35 AM] <stargazer1977> @danoba Most definitely, everyone should check that out. <3
[09/21/17, 10:12:39 AM] <theonlycaroline> So I DM for a great group of ladies and we are also a comic book club, passing around trades with each other. I'm looking forward to buying the CR trade and it getting passed around too.
[09/21/17, 10:12:46 AM] <japenrose> @danoba Always on the spot with the clips! Happy Wednesday, hope your week has been going well!
[09/21/17, 10:12:50 AM] <SnakesBandana> Tolkien invented different languages for goodness sake
[09/21/17, 10:12:50 AM] <Danoba> @stargazer1977 Haha, it was too good.
[09/21/17, 10:12:54 AM] <ZooTeen8> Tolkien is the reason for my existence!!! My parents meet at a Tolkien literature class in college!!!
[09/21/17, 10:12:55 AM] <rasnac_khan> Hey Taliesin I'm sorry but fantasy genre is older than Tolkien. Robert E.Howard was writing his Conan and Kull stories before LOTR.

[09/21/17, 10:12:57 AM] <chuckytheclown11> i agree we need a future girl comic and jody should write for it
[09/21/17, 10:12:59 AM] <Leftcatcher> yay i made it. i was like #TrafficRAGE where's WC?... 😋
[09/21/17, 10:13:06 AM] <pagerunnerj> build my own mythology, several languages, centuries of history... ;)
