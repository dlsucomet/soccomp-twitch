[09/23/17, 7:03:23 AM] <Compel_Bast> So basically a game where both traitors and cheaters have an inherent benefit. Sorry guests, you're not winning this one
[09/23/17, 7:03:23 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @HalfDonut

[09/23/17, 7:03:59 AM] <HalfDonut> Becca's on the LEFT?! Is this a Becca-host test?!
[09/23/17, 7:04:05 AM] <CharlotteOfHall> I'm a sucker for good artwork
[09/23/17, 7:04:20 AM] <HalfDonut> @chaoticloony Okay, thanks! Looking forward to another GtG!

[09/23/17, 7:06:47 AM] <starpilotsix> I assume Axis and Allies was cancelled because someone kept insisting that we hear the arguments of the Axis powers out fully before attacking them.
[09/23/17, 7:06:54 AM] <FandHC> this game sounds really cool :)
[09/23/17, 7:06:56 AM] <hubbs40> the Becca eating kind
[09/23/17, 7:07:02 AM] <CharlotteOfHall> Aww not people pray
[09/23/17, 7:07:04 AM] <Compel_Bast> That's a suspiciously specific denial there, Ivan
[09/23/17, 7:07:14 AM] <davidflegel> @starpilotsix very topical
[09/23/17, 7:07:15 AM] <Andyinsomnia> @starpilotsix, its next week
[09/23/17, 7:07:28 AM] <Compel_Bast> "We didn't eat him!"
[09/23/17, 7:07:36 AM] <chaoticloony> Bile is a Becca or Ivan type color!
[09/23/17, 7:08:17 AM] <HalfDonut> The extra radiation just gets funneled into the Dungeon.
[09/23/17, 7:08:18 AM] <Havok0911> I can't wait to see how Becca cheats in this game KappaHD KappaHD
[09/23/17, 7:08:40 AM] <Critternation3000> gandsBeccasaurus gandsGandsVaxSigil
[09/23/17, 7:08:47 AM] <Mousegsm> The Cheaters eat there dead.
[09/23/17, 7:08:47 AM] <HalfDonut> Becca doesn't cheat! She just finds and exploits creative loopholes!
[09/23/17, 7:09:07 AM] <chaoticloony> I feel so sorry for anyone that joins Becca's tribe!
[09/23/17, 7:09:12 AM] <Andyinsomnia> If this game is even slightly realistic its going to be the biggest beccaWIN of all time
[09/23/17, 7:09:16 AM] <Critternation3000> Becca believes in beccaNoCheating anything else is vicious slander!

[09/23/17, 7:11:37 AM] <CharlotteOfHall> Tickle england
[09/23/17, 7:11:46 AM] <Therealwyldride> When guesting on shows, Sax should turn his hat backwards and call himself Xas. No one will be the wiser.
[09/23/17, 7:11:47 AM] <Dupke87> "Stop rubbing Russia!" Thats a sentence i thought i'd NEVER hear!!
[09/23/17, 7:11:51 AM] <Aledoonia> A giid start already: "Becca stop running Russia"
[09/23/17, 7:12:05 AM] <chaoticloony> Makes me glad i joined Team Sax this week!
[09/23/17, 7:12:22 AM] <tenostark> Look at these nerds playing board games :P

[09/23/17, 7:12:58 AM] <ghstchldrn> "In the meantime let's survive the post apocalypse" - Ivan 2017
[09/23/17, 7:13:04 AM] <Therealwyldride> "Stop rubbing Russia." - A surprising key phrase now at the State Department -- No reason.
[09/23/17, 7:13:10 AM] <Chronob64> I'm going to miss Ivan on Game the Game. BibleThump
[09/23/17, 7:13:48 AM] <Therealwyldride> Soon it'll just be called Becca the Becca.
[09/23/17, 7:13:48 AM] <Holrend> oh cool jacket Kate
[09/23/17, 7:14:40 AM] <chuckytheclown11> why ivan can not be on gtg becuse the show going be on a diff day @Chronob64
[09/23/17, 7:14:47 AM] <Aledoonia> But, truthfully, Becca could run Russia and I would have no problem with it
[09/23/17, 7:14:58 AM] <harberst> They could always make a cardboard cut-out of Ivan on Mines n Crafts that Becca could use as a co-host.
