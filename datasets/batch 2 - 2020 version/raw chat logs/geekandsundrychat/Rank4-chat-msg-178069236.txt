[09/28/17, 12:35:22 PM] <Trekkie313> @Wadewilson1983 Well the owner is kind of notorious, so any chance to stick it to him is good even though he still gets my money. Just not what he wanted LUL

[09/28/17, 12:35:35 PM] <Bitgod> TFW you cable goes down right at 930 for a minute
[09/28/17, 12:35:37 PM] <Dizalddin> @jpsynergy Yeah. It was a good set up though. A lot of shows have a bad Pilot episode. But it didn't feel horrible.
[09/28/17, 12:35:38 PM] <Somnium_Umbra> I know it isn't going to happen but since the Klingons (in Discovery) are uber-purists and they are supposed to be more human (because of a virus) what if they are ALL hiding behind Masks. :-p
[09/28/17, 12:35:42 PM] <Ripartist> woowoo ! time to git goin

[09/28/17, 12:37:33 PM] <RuzgofDI> We come in peace! Shoot to kill! Shoot to Kill!
[09/28/17, 12:37:35 PM] <BreadHax0r> Is the STO thing Federation or Klingon?
[09/28/17, 12:37:38 PM] <Bitgod> We come in peace
[09/28/17, 12:37:39 PM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> blowing up stuff in the name of peace. that's human existence right there
[09/28/17, 12:37:42 PM] <trinity3801> i redownloaded sto just for that
[09/28/17, 12:37:44 PM] <DANfan69> We come in peace... BOOM
[09/28/17, 12:37:44 PM] <shidareAKI> Here comes the lie!
[09/28/17, 12:37:44 PM] <AtmaPrime> We come in peace (shoot to kill shoot to kill)
[09/28/17, 12:37:47 PM] <chaoticloony> We come in peace, SHOOT TO KILL!
[09/28/17, 12:37:47 PM] <BreadHax0r> I might need to start playing my other toon heh
[09/28/17, 12:37:47 PM] <zathyr> We come in peace. Shoot to kill ...
[09/28/17, 12:37:50 PM] <Bazag> Federation usually
[09/28/17, 12:37:52 PM] <KororoX> we come in peace, plastered on the side of the photon torpedo
[09/28/17, 12:37:57 PM] <brakor47> STO is fed and klingon

[09/28/17, 12:38:01 PM] <jpsynergy> PogChamp
[09/28/17, 12:38:05 PM] <PhoenixBlue0> The Temporal Agent pack is for Starfleet characters, but you can play Starfleet, Klingon, or Romulan characters in STO.
[09/28/17, 12:38:05 PM] <brakor47> and romulans, kinda
[09/28/17, 12:38:10 PM] <darthangelus2141> @shidareAKI they say they come in peace but they do not
[09/28/17, 12:38:10 PM] <solarkraken> both and romulan
[09/28/17, 12:38:12 PM] <sirboulevard> STO has Federation, Klingon, and romulans.
[09/28/17, 12:38:12 PM] <AtmaPrime> See, this is why we're Shieldie fam, quoting Star Trekkin' fmgSUP
[09/28/17, 12:38:13 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> Those new discovery uniforms look really great!
[09/28/17, 12:38:16 PM] <shidareAKI> I want one so baaaaad
[09/28/17, 12:38:22 PM] <commandercephalo> we have both fed and klingon. im in fed atm
[09/28/17, 12:38:24 PM] <chaoticloony> Shows that many of us know a great song!
[09/28/17, 12:38:25 PM] <BreadHax0r> My main is a klingon affiliated romulan
[09/28/17, 12:38:25 PM] <Salbastro> Engineering is best role!
[09/28/17, 12:38:28 PM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> as someone who loves morally grey characters i love a good shoot first ask questions later mentality
[09/28/17, 12:38:32 PM] <JustinT1977> I kinda like the Discovery uniforms
[09/28/17, 12:38:36 PM] <Salbastro> we get to technobabble!
[09/28/17, 12:38:45 PM] <stargazer1977> The first episode of Discovery was pretty, but I can tell that it won't really be for me by the season trailer at the end. It focuses on the war with the Klingons and that's not what I want from my Star Trek, I want science and exploration and discovery.
[09/28/17, 12:38:54 PM] <jpsynergy> PogChamp
[09/28/17, 12:39:00 PM] <JustinT1977> USS Sally was one of the ships in episode 2
[09/28/17, 12:39:05 PM] <JustinT1977> I mean Ride
[09/28/17, 12:39:15 PM] <shidareAKI> Jackson gandsSubHype
[09/28/17, 12:39:37 PM] <DungeonMagus> my cc said "Ride"
[09/28/17, 12:39:38 PM] <BreadHax0r> I need more episodes of Discovery to pass judgement
[09/28/17, 12:39:44 PM] <DANfan69> USS Chthulu R'lyeh
[09/28/17, 12:39:49 PM] <Bitgod> Want some USS Rye? Course you do!
[09/28/17, 12:39:51 PM] <Wraithe42> It's because Netflix translated it as Rye, but CBS's stream translated it as the Ride.
[09/28/17, 12:39:52 PM] <jpsynergy> they meant Ryde ;)
[09/28/17, 12:39:52 PM] <BreadHax0r> lol
[09/28/17, 12:39:53 PM] <Bazag> On CBS All Access the captions say USS Ride
[09/28/17, 12:39:57 PM] <Bazag> Netflix captions are wrong
[09/28/17, 12:40:06 PM] <JustinT1977> The trailer isnt all about the Klinons
[09/28/17, 12:40:08 PM] <Dizalddin> Torpedo = First ContactPhasers = Prime Directive
[09/28/17, 12:40:27 PM] <highvoltage988> @stargazer1977 I think, just like DS9, the juxtoposition of war with the stated mission of Starfleet (peaceful exploration) will make for an interesting story
[09/28/17, 12:40:36 PM] <Ripartist> hell yea its toattally y'all!
[09/28/17, 12:40:37 PM] <JustinT1977> I liked alot of things in the first 2 episodes, giving it a chance
[09/28/17, 12:40:47 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Headcannon... I want to shoot something with a headcannon. XD
[09/28/17, 12:40:52 PM] <PhoenixBlue0> And -E and -F. :D
[09/28/17, 12:41:02 PM] <stargazer1977> That's fine, everyone else can love it. It's just not what I want out of Star Trek. That doesn't stop you all from enjoying it, or it shouldn't.
[09/28/17, 12:41:06 PM] <sirboulevard> And -J!
[09/28/17, 12:41:08 PM] <AtmaPrime> I wouldn't think so, like..Defiant doesn't share registry with the Connie-class Defiant
[09/28/17, 12:41:13 PM] <NitemarePhoenix> Brain Matter Torpedoes.
[09/28/17, 12:41:16 PM] <jrc_roller> I am more interested in this show than Discovery.
[09/28/17, 12:41:18 PM] <AtmaPrime> I think it's just the Big E gets that distinction
[09/28/17, 12:41:21 PM] <PhoenixBlue0> I try not to think about the -J, @sirboulevard.
[09/28/17, 12:41:35 PM] <brakor47> don't like the way the klingons look in Disc. Restricts the acting and speaking
[09/28/17, 12:41:37 PM] <shidareAKI> Tales from the loop yaaaaaas
[09/28/17, 12:41:39 PM] <Bazag> lol

[09/28/17, 12:42:05 PM] <BigBalla5412> Shades and leather jackets and Testarossa
[09/28/17, 12:42:15 PM] <darthangelus2141> so its the story of the flash from the teenagers perspective?
[09/28/17, 12:42:15 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> woot so its set in Batavia Illinois! 2 miles from my house :P
[09/28/17, 12:42:18 PM] <JustinT1977> ok i need to check this out after that description by Eric
[09/28/17, 12:42:19 PM] <DANfan69> So when does Gina get a uniform?
[09/28/17, 12:42:22 PM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> never build a particle accelerator under a small town. bad things always happen
[09/28/17, 12:42:23 PM] <SynapticWanderer> this is my favorite game to watch
[09/28/17, 12:42:24 PM] <highvoltage988> @brakor47 I actually like how it restricts speaking, makes Klingon (the language) sound more alien and when they speak English it sounds like a struggle with a foreign tongue
[09/28/17, 12:42:29 PM] <PoorIctrl> What is this game there talking about?
[09/28/17, 12:42:32 PM] <JustinT1977> Gina needs a uniform

[09/28/17, 12:43:16 PM] <jrc_roller> I might fall asleep so I'm telling you guys now: eject the warp corps. It always works and is the best strategy.
[09/28/17, 12:43:18 PM] <stargazer1977> @Impossiblegirl11 hey girl :)

[09/28/17, 12:43:18 PM] <celticfif3> Things I learned from watching Star Trek Discovery...Black Vulcans straighten their hair. Burnham's hair in prison is natural. (Having a hard time picturing Vulcans straightening their hair, but you do you, boo.)
[09/28/17, 12:43:20 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Wait, literally huge?
[09/28/17, 12:43:22 PM] <Trekkie313> Are we going to die?

[09/28/17, 12:43:32 PM] <darthangelus2141> but the collision happened 1.8 billion years ago
[09/28/17, 12:43:35 PM] <PhoenixBlue0> Ejecting the warp core never worked in a Galaxy-class ship.

[09/28/17, 12:44:08 PM] <stargazer1977> Indeed, Gravitational Waves were predicted by General Relativity in 1922. We have been looking for them for a long time.
[09/28/17, 12:44:09 PM] <shidareAKI> Omg
[09/28/17, 12:44:11 PM] <HawkeyeNFO> the detector is basically a laser interferometer
