[10/3/17, 10:10:49 AM] <StrangelyRaidur> Sam and Amy excited at the same time might just be too much for this reality to bear.
[10/3/17, 10:10:52 AM] <KristynEStart> that's surprising usually the twitch app has better volume. Maybe turn down the base?
[10/3/17, 10:11:01 AM] <techiecarer> No Hector! Stop trying to make Kelvin a thing!
[10/3/17, 10:11:04 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> if they'd put up a Lenovo link, chat would probably have Funded a uniform for Gina by now!

[10/3/17, 10:13:38 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> it's only a problem if you think it's a problem
[10/3/17, 10:13:38 AM] <JeffM0307> Are you at Laura Bailey-level, Sam? :)
[10/3/17, 10:13:40 AM] <Salbastro> TOOOOOOTALLY not a problem

[10/3/17, 10:14:13 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Good subtle commentary, Eric. <3
[10/3/17, 10:14:25 AM] <FlavahText> reminds me of a fella I knew in college who carried all his books in a A-Team pillow case instead of a backpack...
[10/3/17, 10:14:28 AM] <theheronightwing> we are borg
[10/3/17, 10:14:30 AM] <SynapticWanderer> excited sam is how anyone got me to watch this show in the first place, and it turns out it's amazing
[10/3/17, 10:14:32 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> and all, for a while, is well with the world
[10/3/17, 10:14:32 AM] <stargazer1977> Laura Bailey level is not even a dice bag any more, that's a dice backpack or even, heaven forbid, a dice rucksack.
[10/3/17, 10:14:35 AM] <Ripartist> @PipersTwin there you are (couldnt find you in chat at first lol) you are truly awesome =D
