[10/5/17, 7:05:22 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> I'm thinking they are going to need to get Becca a chair for this part of the show
[10/5/17, 7:05:24 AM] <chaoticloony> @Quaraxkad1 This is the News part of Game the Game
[10/5/17, 7:05:24 AM] <Leigh574> LOL Was wondering who was messing with her behind the camera

[10/5/17, 7:05:25 AM] <rockxtv> RIP Bryan Foster
[10/5/17, 7:05:26 AM] <Zismarith> @MattyPick22 I'm fairly sure it's been there since day 1. Someone proposed to Stef during the Lupus charity launch stream XD
[10/5/17, 7:05:30 AM] <elyssaphillips> Becca doesn't CHEAT - But she's just STRATEGIC. I should know - I was once a guest on the show. It was crazy fun.
[10/5/17, 7:05:33 AM] <desertshaddow> Iâ€™m going to miss Ivan. :(
[10/5/17, 7:05:38 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> She will Brian...you know it...

[10/5/17, 7:06:06 AM] <Critternation3000> Becca believes in beccaNoCheating anything else is vicious slander!
[10/5/17, 7:06:07 AM] <Quaraxkad1> i thought Becca was supposed to have a new Winners Throne?
[10/5/17, 7:06:12 AM] <ravensburgermaster> does anyone know why Ivan left?
[10/5/17, 7:06:20 AM] <elyssaphillips> I've always wanted to be a ghost
[10/5/17, 7:06:28 AM] <TheDiMono> @ravensburgermaster He was tired of being right all the time

[10/5/17, 7:08:52 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> This is a lot of exposition to put on ONE person....even Becca....
[10/5/17, 7:08:52 AM] <Andyinsomnia> What was that about Ivan's tomb?
[10/5/17, 7:08:56 AM] <tomservo544> Aww, I was under the impression that AYBGF was getting more time for some reason. Darn

[10/5/17, 7:09:13 AM] <CampbellXL> Does Betrayal do anything to solve for real early game Haunt rolls?

[10/5/17, 7:09:57 AM] <TommyHobo> Ivan is currently perfecting his 'Seriously, I'm not the traitor face.'
[10/5/17, 7:10:02 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> What if Ivan betrays you by making you THINK he is the traitor but isn't....
[10/5/17, 7:10:06 AM] <Chronob64> @campbellxl can't happen till at least the third omen now
