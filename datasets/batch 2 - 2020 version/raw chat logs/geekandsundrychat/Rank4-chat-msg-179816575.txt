[10/5/17, 10:13:54 AM] <denizenofdarkness> I'm bummed I couldn't catch up to Crit Role before tomorrow. I'm only on 89. :(
[10/5/17, 10:13:55 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah...
[10/5/17, 10:13:55 AM] <cinphoria> Upstairs is where you go to disappear
[10/5/17, 10:13:57 AM] <misssunflower94> I need a tour of this building some time
[10/5/17, 10:13:57 AM] <harberst> The building grows when you're not watching it.
[10/5/17, 10:13:59 AM] <Dkslurker> Critical Role is the greatest show on the net. It is our "Game of Thrones".
[10/5/17, 10:14:00 AM] <DragonsDusk> Is your building a TARDIS?
[10/5/17, 10:14:00 AM] <ToonEzon> huh, but ive seen stairs in some of the behind the scenes pics here and there
[10/5/17, 10:14:04 AM] <sketchysunflower13> Latveria!
[10/5/17, 10:14:04 AM] <tortugadelmar> We are all Dr. Doom on the inside

[10/5/17, 10:14:14 AM] <AnimeStarkid23> for what may be the last episode of critical role, good luck, Taliesin!

[10/5/17, 10:14:28 AM] <cinphoria> Wait, does this make upstairs - STATION MANAGEMENT?
[10/5/17, 10:14:28 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Erika Ishii rappelling in would be EPIC
[10/5/17, 10:14:31 AM] <owifig> Please - she lives in a BALL PIT
[10/5/17, 10:14:32 AM] <Dr_sterben> Talisen gets frozen in carbonite and is now just a prop on the show.
[10/5/17, 10:14:33 AM] <halfaringcircus> She has a web up there.
[10/5/17, 10:14:37 AM] <super390> A bag of potatoes also rains from the ceiling.

[10/5/17, 10:14:46 AM] <CrashTestGremlin> shoot it on greenscreen so you can use it as an overlay
[10/5/17, 10:14:49 AM] <ToonEzon> wow, i really like tal's shirt
[10/5/17, 10:14:49 AM] <stargazer1977> I would love for them to shoot that. Erika is great.
[10/5/17, 10:14:51 AM] <Rookiez78> Love the little mask on the blackboard too!
[10/5/17, 10:14:56 AM] <zathyr> Erika, Phantom of the Sundry?
[10/5/17, 10:15:01 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> QUESTION: If the upstairs is Latveria, does that mean the G&S studio has diplomatic immunity?
[10/5/17, 10:15:06 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @super390 A bag of TINY potatoes. XD
[10/5/17, 10:15:09 AM] <KristynEStart> There are no floors above just stairs like labyrinth.
[10/5/17, 10:15:10 AM] <cinphoria> wooooow

[10/5/17, 10:15:34 AM] <gothfoxdude> Why Taliesin.
[10/5/17, 10:15:38 AM] <jrc_roller> I don't believe they're in a building. :/
[10/5/17, 10:15:40 AM] <MeggieMay328> Bunch of people just wandered in :D
[10/5/17, 10:15:45 AM] <AromiaFlyce> Woot! Do we do the Time Warp?

[10/5/17, 10:15:46 AM] <Settiai> I've so missed getting to watch this live. <3
[10/5/17, 10:15:54 AM] <gothfoxdude> What did we do to deserve a hair shock this early?
[10/5/17, 10:15:55 AM] <ToonEzon> wait, they have SINERGY? so do all these guys also secretly run a halfway house for wayward teens?
[10/5/17, 10:16:03 AM] <FuffyButt> game the game feels very left out right now

[10/5/17, 10:16:10 AM] <Kol_Drake> I thought Amy said "Death Poop"
[10/5/17, 10:16:12 AM] <Shadowner> but, game the game...
[10/5/17, 10:16:14 AM] <denizenofdarkness> Death Proof was second, I'm pretty sure
