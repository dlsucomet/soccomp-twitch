[10/6/17, 7:07:56 AM] <TheDiMono> @gamercat88 That was the first one where you could send in part of the back page and they'd send you a card, right?
[10/6/17, 7:08:02 AM] <Compel_Bast> "I was working at a coffee shop"Ryan *really* is Dream Daddy Mat!
[10/6/17, 7:08:05 AM] <Iwillgotohell2> will this be rebroadcasted tomorrow?
[10/6/17, 7:08:13 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> I loved reading all the quotes on the cards and figure out (or write my own) lore...
[10/6/17, 7:08:13 AM] <gamercat88> @TheDiMono yes
[10/6/17, 7:08:20 AM] <adventuresofTONI> hahaha @Compel_Bast yesss!!
[10/6/17, 7:08:31 AM] <TheDiMono> @gamercat88 I used to have that book. Don't remember what I did with it

[10/6/17, 7:09:02 AM] <RandGamp> New shoooow
[10/6/17, 7:09:10 AM] <Danoba> @SpoonDotlol Chat's up as well.
[10/6/17, 7:09:20 AM] <Danoba> Well on the usual TV.
[10/6/17, 7:09:26 AM] <postdataest> @Iwillgotohell2 all shows are rebroadcast (except for those that are alpha shows and only simulcast TM as an example)
[10/6/17, 7:09:41 AM] <TheDiMono> I used to play a lot of Magic, to the point that I traded my Gameboy for a Library of Alexandria. I stopped when I realized I'd have to sink a thousand dollars a year into the game to stay competitive
[10/6/17, 7:09:45 AM] <gamercat88> @TheDiMono i got one at our local used book store... sadly the back had been ripped out but still awesome read and just planes fun (haha yes lame joke)
[10/6/17, 7:10:13 AM] <stargazer1977> It's like Dark Souls, to me. Most people who play those games don't care about the lore, they play for the mechanics. But for those of us that care about the lore, we care about it deeply and dive very deep inside it.
[10/6/17, 7:10:21 AM] <TheDiMono> I ended up selling my collection for some dollars, and then reinvested all of that money into other people
[10/6/17, 7:10:28 AM] <warhero9881> i played in college TheDiMono, havnt in a few years
[10/6/17, 7:10:33 AM] <TheFootKnight> Oh man. Dark Souls lore. So good.
[10/6/17, 7:10:41 AM] <dayntee> YAAAAY RYAN! :D

[10/6/17, 7:10:57 AM] <warhero9881> ryan is a natural with this
[10/6/17, 7:10:59 AM] <chaoticloony> Battletech is one game that i played that i also payed so much to the lore!
[10/6/17, 7:11:00 AM] <Danoba> Hey @dayntee

[10/6/17, 7:11:04 AM] <sservin2000> hey I'm new here dose critical role come on next? and if I subscribe is it to the whole network or just the show?
[10/6/17, 7:11:06 AM] <jpcguy89> Ryan is the best.
[10/6/17, 7:11:08 AM] <gingersnaps05> I've always been interested in MtG but have been unable to play it. I did download that game for Xbox to learn, but it crashed too much. :(
