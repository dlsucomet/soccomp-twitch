[10/10/17, 10:03:32 AM] <highvoltage988> @Dexter2015 as my mom would always tell this young Trekkie when arguing with his SW fan friend: there'd be no SW without Trek, but the Trek franchise would've died without SW
[10/10/17, 10:03:34 AM] <allenshock1> Volume too low again
[10/10/17, 10:03:44 AM] <mekrac> First time live for me! woot
[10/10/17, 10:03:51 AM] <Bitgod> I haven't played STO in so long, I'd have to roll a new character just to do the tutorial again

[10/10/17, 10:04:01 AM] <ToonEzon> do we get to go to DS k-7 in the tos arc? and deal with all the tribbles
[10/10/17, 10:04:03 AM] <crthemighty> i believe it's "stay turnt" eric
[10/10/17, 10:04:04 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> sci fi is so much larger than star wars and star trek though
[10/10/17, 10:04:06 AM] <highvoltage988> @ToonEzon I'm mixed on Discovery so far but I'm actually a big fan of the Klingons in it
[10/10/17, 10:04:07 AM] <Biohybrid> Yay! I'm here to watch my friend Bonnie do the thing live :)
[10/10/17, 10:04:09 AM] <NitemarePhoenix> Woo made it!
[10/10/17, 10:04:16 AM] <Todasul> reminds of checking my bridge officers
[10/10/17, 10:04:20 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> did Aliza ever get through the tutorial?
[10/10/17, 10:04:22 AM] <CaptainTalon447> @Ripartist Doing good converting races from VAST from World of Darkness to Starfinder
[10/10/17, 10:04:32 AM] <ElfGiftSpeaks> Trek Check!
[10/10/17, 10:04:38 AM] <CLJedi> I'm loving discovery. it's different but I like it.
[10/10/17, 10:04:48 AM] <jpsynergy> Treck Checked!
[10/10/17, 10:04:54 AM] <jpsynergy> Trek*
[10/10/17, 10:04:55 AM] <highvoltage988> @Gryphon_oFH wasn't it Bonnie still fighting the Borg in the tutorial while the rest were playing with us?
[10/10/17, 10:05:03 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> watch Orville
[10/10/17, 10:05:07 AM] <Avenger1735> Is it black screen for everyone?
[10/10/17, 10:05:08 AM] <CelestialChickin> Yep
[10/10/17, 10:05:10 AM] <DJPheonyx> Yes it was
[10/10/17, 10:05:10 AM] <Gamerprince333> wow
[10/10/17, 10:05:11 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> lol
[10/10/17, 10:05:12 AM] <MJasonO> how far in are they?
[10/10/17, 10:05:16 AM] <crthemighty> 40 days and 40 nights on a ship? where have i heard that before
[10/10/17, 10:05:17 AM] <starpilotsix> TrekCheck Yourself before you Deck Wreck yourself.
[10/10/17, 10:05:18 AM] <DJPheonyx> Refresh your screen
[10/10/17, 10:05:21 AM] <GuruMat> @Avenger1735 No, refresh
[10/10/17, 10:05:22 AM] <ToonEzon> @highvoltage988 i'm also mixed on it, but not a fan of the Klingons in it, the makeup and costumes are way too heavy, t the point of impeding on the proformances
[10/10/17, 10:05:26 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> I thought it was both actually, but Bonnie said she'd gotten through it - or so I thought
[10/10/17, 10:05:31 AM] <TodayImKae> they are doing announcements
[10/10/17, 10:05:32 AM] <ElfGiftSpeaks> !glittereric

[10/10/17, 10:05:37 AM] <brakor47> orville is better than discovery right now, imo

[10/10/17, 10:05:59 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> the majority of sci fi is better than Discovery right now
[10/10/17, 10:06:07 AM] <Airmastercustom> Too bad we can not land ships on planets in STO, maybe some day =D
[10/10/17, 10:06:12 AM] <brakor47> tru dat
[10/10/17, 10:06:13 AM] <ToonEzon> can someone remind me where in the time line we are in this episode?
[10/10/17, 10:06:18 AM] <highvoltage988> @ToonEzon yeah the big Xenomorph-style heads are hard to get used to, but I'm actually a big fan of how the mouth prosthetics affect how they speak Klingon, it makes it sound more alien
[10/10/17, 10:06:18 AM] <ElfGiftSpeaks> <3 <3
[10/10/17, 10:06:25 AM] <jpsynergy> loved it <3
[10/10/17, 10:06:32 AM] <Ripartist> @CaptainTalon447 wow that sounds like a daunting and tiring task but i bet your loving it
[10/10/17, 10:06:33 AM] <Trekkie313> Wow
[10/10/17, 10:06:36 AM] <AllFatherOdinSon> discovery is good
[10/10/17, 10:06:38 AM] <chiplickin> I'm gonna cry....
[10/10/17, 10:06:40 AM] <DJPheonyx> Mid Season 4 DS9/ Season 1 Voyager
[10/10/17, 10:06:45 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> so Excited for whatever form the new campaign takes!
[10/10/17, 10:06:51 AM] <JeffM0307> Okay, we know this Thursday is it.
[10/10/17, 10:06:59 AM] <highvoltage988> we need Eric guesting on CR and the CR cast showing up on SoT!!
[10/10/17, 10:07:03 AM] <GarrettCMB> is there going to be another critical role series? Are they starting from the beginning again?
[10/10/17, 10:07:03 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> <3 Feel the love! <3 The love is real! <3
[10/10/17, 10:07:06 AM] <CaptainTalon447> @Ripartist Actually it's not that hard if you follow the rules for creating homebrew races from Pathfinder
[10/10/17, 10:07:08 AM] <Zismarith> @ToonEzon DS9, halfway, Klingons are pissed cause we hit 'em what with the whole shapeshifter thing.
[10/10/17, 10:07:10 AM] <DANfan69> Critical Role ending BibleThump
[10/10/17, 10:07:15 AM] <Ripartist> <3
[10/10/17, 10:07:17 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @Gryphon_oFH Matt said a 20 year jump to future.
[10/10/17, 10:07:19 AM] <brakor47> new campaign, set 10 years later?
[10/10/17, 10:07:25 AM] <jpsynergy> #momstah !
[10/10/17, 10:07:26 AM] <Biohybrid> The new campign prolly won't start til Matt and Marisha come back from their honeymoon
[10/10/17, 10:07:30 AM] <ElfGiftSpeaks> <3 Pike
[10/10/17, 10:07:33 AM] <starpilotsix> Just as long as your favorite Trek captain isn't Pike. ;)
[10/10/17, 10:07:35 AM] <Saraphys> Sam's sacrificing Scanlan's 9th Lvl spell slot... it was so sad!!!
[10/10/17, 10:07:37 AM] <Sollux_kid8> Same, Eric!
[10/10/17, 10:07:38 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> 20 years later
[10/10/17, 10:07:39 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> indeed, but that's just one little detail lol
[10/10/17, 10:07:42 AM] <brakor47> sam killed it last week
[10/10/17, 10:07:45 AM] <Avenger1735> gandsAJinSpace gandsAJinSpace gandsAJinSpace
[10/10/17, 10:07:48 AM] <Todasul> @DANfan69 well the story of Vox Machina only probably
[10/10/17, 10:07:48 AM] <highvoltage988> @garrettcmb, yes they have new characters planned and a new campaign will begin, but likely it won't be right away
[10/10/17, 10:07:53 AM] <ToonEzon> @highvoltage988 also the overly combersom teath and face prosthetics, theyre obviously struggeling, the teeth on top of the Klingon language
[10/10/17, 10:07:56 AM] <DANfan69> Where's Amy?
[10/10/17, 10:07:58 AM] <CLJedi> I think the thing with the albino at the end of the last episode, we may see more familiar looking klingons
[10/10/17, 10:08:03 AM] <CaptainTalon447> Admittedly I'm weird af I want Grog and Arkhan slash fiction :P
[10/10/17, 10:08:03 AM] <ToonEzon> thanks @Zismarith
[10/10/17, 10:08:06 AM] <jeffrey_lindsey> Yay Windows to Sky!
[10/10/17, 10:08:10 AM] <TheComicBookAddict> no amy?
[10/10/17, 10:08:10 AM] <allenshock1> My tv is maxxed and I can't hear it(:
[10/10/17, 10:08:16 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> Sam killed it over at Saving Throw playing 10 Candles yesterday ! ! ! so good!
[10/10/17, 10:08:16 AM] <jpsynergy> bonnie is a fantastic singer <3
[10/10/17, 10:08:18 AM] <Bitgod> Dance baby dance
[10/10/17, 10:08:19 AM] <TodayImKae> that's not weird
[10/10/17, 10:08:22 AM] <JeffM0307> @DANfan69 Still coming home from NYCC. She might be here later.
[10/10/17, 10:08:26 AM] <chiplickin> Amy?
[10/10/17, 10:08:31 AM] <DJPheonyx> Wait... where's Amy?
[10/10/17, 10:08:34 AM] <Biohybrid> Frak Arkhan...anyone who say the episode already knows why
[10/10/17, 10:08:39 AM] <Biohybrid> *saw
[10/10/17, 10:08:40 AM] <barco588> wheres amy
[10/10/17, 10:08:45 AM] <Danoba> @chiplickin Amy was in NY for NYCC.
[10/10/17, 10:08:48 AM] <Trekkie313> Doctor is MIA
[10/10/17, 10:08:49 AM] <marvinhood> just business yo
[10/10/17, 10:08:50 AM] <CLJedi> Amy got eaten by the holotarg
[10/10/17, 10:08:52 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> Amy is still on the way back from NYCC apparently
[10/10/17, 10:09:00 AM] <ToonEzon> @Zismarith so, season 3? is this still before they exposed changling martok?
[10/10/17, 10:09:07 AM] <Rinvaran> Downa Doctor? Sad!
[10/10/17, 10:09:08 AM] <Ripartist> @CaptainTalon447 pretty cool =)
[10/10/17, 10:09:13 AM] <Trekkie313> Is this in Cali or New York
[10/10/17, 10:09:13 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> the Doctor is Mid-Transport !
[10/10/17, 10:09:13 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> she got sucked into the multiverse obviously
[10/10/17, 10:09:37 AM] <AverageCitizen> I wanna see Mercer on Shield of Tomorrow. Anyone else?
[10/10/17, 10:09:38 AM] <highvoltage988> @ToonEzon agree to disagree I guess, I love how the makeup affects the Klingon pronounciation and causes them to struggle with English (as to them it's an entirely alien tongue)
[10/10/17, 10:09:43 AM] <Chovexani> ehehe that's so cute
[10/10/17, 10:09:45 AM] <ElfGiftSpeaks> Aww
[10/10/17, 10:09:47 AM] <Trekkie313> Beanie?
[10/10/17, 10:09:48 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> One of your ships lights are offline behing Bonnie and Chief. Did someone blew out some power relays on the bridge? :P
[10/10/17, 10:09:55 AM] <super390> Star Trek is surprisingly bereft of headgear.
[10/10/17, 10:09:56 AM] <ToonEzon> hat? winter? your in LA what is winter?
[10/10/17, 10:09:57 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> Well GIVE them quests :-p
[10/10/17, 10:10:03 AM] <highvoltage988> @AverageCitizen I want total cast-to-cast crossovers
[10/10/17, 10:10:05 AM] <CelestialChickin> He'll mess up his hair!
[10/10/17, 10:10:07 AM] <CLJedi> btw that tales from the loop show, is that going to be regular or was that a one-off
[10/10/17, 10:10:09 AM] <Glimjii> Snort count 1
[10/10/17, 10:10:11 AM] <jpsynergy> :D
[10/10/17, 10:10:15 AM] <realitymanifold> lol

[10/10/17, 10:10:20 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> nice
[10/10/17, 10:10:26 AM] <Biohybrid> NPC...for extra protection
[10/10/17, 10:10:27 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> no thanks-- I want Mercer to play for me, but I suppose failing that -- sure, he'd be welcome to SoT
[10/10/17, 10:10:28 AM] <majimaji> pfft lol
[10/10/17, 10:10:30 AM] <Trekkie313> Eh, I prefer the hair Kreygasm
[10/10/17, 10:10:31 AM] <Todasul> #excited!
[10/10/17, 10:10:32 AM] <Ripartist> ANNNNNND CLIPPED
[10/10/17, 10:10:33 AM] <meaningofnightt> eric is amazing
[10/10/17, 10:10:36 AM] <Glimjii> Also LOVE IT Eric
[10/10/17, 10:10:36 AM] <steelneko> Oh, Sam <3
[10/10/17, 10:10:38 AM] <DANfan69> [Excitement Intensifies]
[10/10/17, 10:10:42 AM] <crthemighty> we should hook sam up to the power grid
[10/10/17, 10:10:44 AM] <mrpatduke> Sam, I take it, is excited.
[10/10/17, 10:10:46 AM] <postdataest> !whodat
[10/10/17, 10:10:46 AM] <Nightbot> GM Eric Campbell ( twitter.com/16BitEric ), Hector Navarro ( twitter.com/Hectorisfunny ), Sam de Leve ( twitter.com/ChaiKovsky ), Bonnie Gordon ( twitter.com/BonnieBellG ), Aliza Pearl ( twitter.com/AlizaPearl ) and Gina DeVivo ( twitter.com/PocketGina ).
[10/10/17, 10:10:46 AM] <JeffM0307> There's the launch phrase and away we go.
[10/10/17, 10:10:47 AM] <WhiteNekoKnight> Could you imagine a group of people going to conventions in NPC garb and giving out actual quests to people.
[10/10/17, 10:10:48 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Sam is the reason I bought rainbow dice
[10/10/17, 10:10:51 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Wow, I forgot Sam has that type of voice...
[10/10/17, 10:10:52 AM] <Somnium_Umbra> Wait in the vendor line and get me a hotdog....200 xp
[10/10/17, 10:11:02 AM] <brakor47> just needs the hat whenever he's talking as another char. so all the time, really
[10/10/17, 10:11:04 AM] <CLJedi> Sam could power a small metropolitan city
[10/10/17, 10:11:11 AM] <highvoltage988> Sam's excitement announcement every week fuels my Twitter reaction GIF stash
[10/10/17, 10:11:15 AM] <Danoba> https://clips.twitch.tv/ObedientRepleteSandpiperHotPokket
[10/10/17, 10:11:22 AM] <Airmastercustom> does it matter if I bring back a NQ or HQ Hotdog?
[10/10/17, 10:11:22 AM] <ToonEzon> @highvoltage988 its forcing the actors to push into their nostrils and close off the breathing, making the klingonese sound like gibberish
[10/10/17, 10:11:24 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> Now all we need is for someone to make him a hat that says 'stupid, sexy Eric' in honor of his portrayal of Zazrit! ;)
[10/10/17, 10:11:32 AM] <AtmaPrime> ENGAGE fmgSUP
[10/10/17, 10:11:42 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> @Danoba if for some reason you need to throttle down Sam tonight, tell Eric to just place a TEA Candle where she can see it :P
[10/10/17, 10:11:46 AM] <Trekkie313> Eric needs to fully grow that beard, GO FULL RIKER
[10/10/17, 10:11:49 AM] <Sollux_kid8> Sam's voice gets an octave higher every week with "I'm excited!", and they are so adorable
[10/10/17, 10:11:55 AM] <Danoba> @Gryphon_oFH They*
[10/10/17, 10:12:04 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> \\// @Danoba \\//

[10/10/17, 10:12:11 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> lol indeed!
[10/10/17, 10:12:15 AM] <ZephyrPhoenyx> I don't think I have ever been as excited as Sam's reaction... I'm jealous lol
[10/10/17, 10:12:15 AM] <peterthebold> Thursdays at 7:00pm, Critical Role
[10/10/17, 10:12:23 AM] <kolbedanielson> Where's amy?
[10/10/17, 10:12:34 AM] <Danoba> @kolbedanielson Coming back from NYCC.
[10/10/17, 10:12:36 AM] <wildbronco38> I wouldn't mind seeing Eric guest DM a CR one-shot...
[10/10/17, 10:12:37 AM] <jpsynergy> amys prolly just a lil late
[10/10/17, 10:12:39 AM] <sirboulevard> Shes on her way back from NYCC
[10/10/17, 10:12:43 AM] <kolbedanielson> Ahhh
[10/10/17, 10:12:44 AM] <Trekkie313> Doctor is on an away mission
[10/10/17, 10:12:45 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Hector is telling the truth if someone is watching that moment at 6:55 PM PST
[10/10/17, 10:12:52 AM] <ToonEzon> @highvoltage988 also not a fan of the look over all, though, id tend to like to think t'kuv'ma's isn't Klingon in origin, but hur'q
[10/10/17, 10:13:01 AM] <Biohybrid> How far is this campaign into the story? I just joined this one really
[10/10/17, 10:13:02 AM] <cabezadecervez> Woo hooo. Cr in 5 minutes!
[10/10/17, 10:13:09 AM] <CelestialChickin> Hopefully she doesn't catch something while on the plane. Planes are such breeding grounds for viruses.
