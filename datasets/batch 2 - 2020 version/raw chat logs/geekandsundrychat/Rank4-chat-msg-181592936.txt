[10/12/17, 10:09:22 AM] <Cadmandu2000> AOL is now an internet zombie. (Relevant to theme!)

[10/12/17, 10:09:32 AM] <ArtemisRuse> Oh, Conqurer worm?
[10/12/17, 10:09:33 AM] <rasnac_khan> OMG Taliesin, Hellboy is the perfect comic book for you!
[10/12/17, 10:09:35 AM] <AromiaFlyce> my dad would love that episode. He loves Hellboy
[10/12/17, 10:09:37 AM] <chiplickin> I like Amy's low pigtails.
[10/12/17, 10:09:42 AM] <jale_sm> They're on comixology unlimited if you want to catch up
[10/12/17, 10:10:02 AM] <misssunflower94> I should have put 'First Appearances' in Matt's lyrics
[10/12/17, 10:10:03 AM] <PopCultureGuy> Min YOLA
[10/12/17, 10:10:09 AM] <Vance1982> pissed that Ron pearlman will not be in the new Hellboy

[10/12/17, 10:10:24 AM] <montanabilly> The Wasteland comic that Taliesin introduced to me has me in a Halloween mood.
[10/12/17, 10:10:27 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @rasnac_khan Not sure they'll go that far since 'Hellboy in Hell' is "technically" the last story so it might not be a good idea for spoiler reasons
[10/12/17, 10:10:27 AM] <CrashTestGremlin> so sad we won't get to see del toro's 3rd hellboy
[10/12/17, 10:10:27 AM] <tortugadelmar> Is that wolfman in the background?
[10/12/17, 10:10:34 AM] <KristynEStart> Critical Role Origins is Dark Horse, right?
[10/12/17, 10:10:36 AM] <Rookiez78> Hellboy 2 is one of my all-time fave movies
[10/12/17, 10:10:36 AM] <stargazer1977> @GeekandSundry make sure Matt knows that he has a new song this week. The sequel to Goth Boy is out. :)

[10/12/17, 10:10:46 AM] <PopCultureGuy> I like the guy from Stranger Things. He'll be a good Hellboy.
[10/12/17, 10:10:47 AM] <chuckytheclown11> right @KristynEStart
[10/12/17, 10:10:47 AM] <RMutt1917> @KristynEStart yes

[10/12/17, 10:11:17 AM] <Vondoorgirl> Ron Perlman was such a great Hellboy.
[10/12/17, 10:11:18 AM] <halfaringcircus> He's not Sam.
[10/12/17, 10:11:27 AM] <super390> I'm going to save up my reverence for Ron Perlman until next week and let it all out.
[10/12/17, 10:11:27 AM] <UncleOok> he's moderately acquainted with Hellboy
[10/12/17, 10:11:28 AM] <rasnac_khan> Hellboy is the best thing happened to comics since Alan Moore.
[10/12/17, 10:11:29 AM] <queendanida> oh awesome!!!
[10/12/17, 10:11:29 AM] <cinphoria> AHAHAHA

[10/12/17, 10:11:54 AM] <phoenixgoth> I feel like Tal hasn't recovered from last week's CR, bless him
[10/12/17, 10:11:56 AM] <cinphoria> I'm so confused and Taliesin is at at least 8 cats right now
[10/12/17, 10:11:56 AM] <misssunflower94> Tal you nerd
[10/12/17, 10:11:57 AM] <artistsomeday> He doesn't know when people are dressing him. Needs sleep
[10/12/17, 10:11:57 AM] <runningfool11> THE SHIRT SHOULD BE HOLOGRAPHIC
[10/12/17, 10:11:59 AM] <LizForkin> I have mine
[10/12/17, 10:12:01 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @rookiez78 Fun fact if you didn't know: Hellboy 2 wasn't based on a comic at all (for the most part) it's an original story :)
[10/12/17, 10:12:02 AM] <ToonEzon> ok, I kinda love amy's shock grey hair
[10/12/17, 10:12:04 AM] <ArtemisRuse> A manifesting shirt is the least suprising thing about Taliesin
[10/12/17, 10:12:09 AM] <Dmlt13> LMAO
[10/12/17, 10:12:14 AM] <rasnac_khan> Someone quick GIF that sick moves from Taliesin! :D
[10/12/17, 10:12:21 AM] <go_jg> <3 Want that shirt so much! gandsLessthanthree

[10/12/17, 10:12:30 AM] <longingfordeath_damsel> love the grey
[10/12/17, 10:12:31 AM] <super390> This should have been the logo for The CW.
[10/12/17, 10:12:32 AM] <ToonEzon> ok, so I think imma go for it with a physical taldorei
[10/12/17, 10:12:34 AM] <cinphoria> We want them in not the USAAAAAA
[10/12/17, 10:12:35 AM] <1uniqueBeast> Three Amy Dallens could fit in that shirt.
[10/12/17, 10:12:36 AM] <LizForkin> I revealed my shirt on our social media
[10/12/17, 10:12:37 AM] <Dmlt13> Nice Chief
[10/12/17, 10:12:43 AM] <cinphoria> :P
[10/12/17, 10:12:50 AM] <stargazer1977> Very nice shirt, I'm tempted. Might be my next shirt after my Jocks Machina shirts show up.
[10/12/17, 10:12:51 AM] <chuckytheclown11> we hear u sax

[10/12/17, 10:13:04 AM] <SakuraWindsS> I freaking love Taliesin
[10/12/17, 10:13:07 AM] <UncleOok> I bought mine. I have issues.

[10/12/17, 10:13:19 AM] <UncleOok> (which is appropriate for a show about comics)
[10/12/17, 10:13:28 AM] <stargazer1977> Yeah, I can't wait to see that movie.
[10/12/17, 10:13:33 AM] <ToonEzon> ooh I NEED to see that
[10/12/17, 10:13:37 AM] <chuckytheclown11> i wanna see it

[10/12/17, 10:13:41 AM] <Rookiez78> OOOH
[10/12/17, 10:13:51 AM] <mathemagician_> I'm excited for that movie
[10/12/17, 10:13:54 AM] <tortugadelmar> I saw the trailer recently
[10/12/17, 10:13:55 AM] <Critternation3000> can't wait to see it
[10/12/17, 10:13:56 AM] <cinphoria> Relevant to this, trans and NB artists should check this project out http://powerandmagic.tumblr.com/post/166047105220/heartwood-non-binary-tales-of-sylvan-fantasy-is
[10/12/17, 10:13:58 AM] <Rookiez78> I've seen so little ads for it I'm really interested in that!
[10/12/17, 10:14:05 AM] <tortugadelmar> It looks interesting
[10/12/17, 10:14:06 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> There's been a few reviews for the movie Matt, just not a lot. They've all been positive so far :)
[10/12/17, 10:14:07 AM] <ToonEzon> i wonder if James Marsdon is in it (shamefull wink)
[10/12/17, 10:14:08 AM] <artistsomeday> Tal is increasing to 9 cats
[10/12/17, 10:14:09 AM] <mommypanda35> They need to make one based on the Sean Howe book
[10/12/17, 10:14:11 AM] <mommypanda35> YES AMY
[10/12/17, 10:14:21 AM] <JeffM0307> I'll say a few
[10/12/17, 10:14:23 AM] <UncleOok> Lee & Kirby - that'll have the conflict folks like
[10/12/17, 10:14:26 AM] <stargazer1977> I've seen 2 different trailers for it, but I'll probably have to travel to see it.
[10/12/17, 10:14:28 AM] <AnimeStarkid23> there are all a lot of stuff that I want to buy from the geek and sundry and alpha store but don't have the money for
[10/12/17, 10:14:34 AM] <ToonEzon> is there an Eisner biopic in the works?
[10/12/17, 10:14:40 AM] <stargazer1977> I love Kavalier and Clay, Michael Chabon is a great writer.
[10/12/17, 10:14:46 AM] <go_jg> Need to see it.
[10/12/17, 10:14:56 AM] <stargazer1977> Book won the Pulitzer.
[10/12/17, 10:14:58 AM] <AromiaFlyce> My mother saw the previews, sighed and shook her head. My dad made a face. I am excited for it.....My family. :\
[10/12/17, 10:14:59 AM] <jubileee_> Herbie: Fully Loaded?

[10/12/17, 10:15:01 AM] <CrashTestGremlin> it's this because sex sells
[10/12/17, 10:15:05 AM] <halfaringcircus> proof that someone loves us and wants us to be happy?

[10/12/17, 10:15:12 AM] <mogodontsocialize> hey got here late, are they actually talking about comics yet :P
[10/12/17, 10:15:12 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @ToonEzon I *think* so. Maybe?

[10/12/17, 10:15:22 AM] <owifig> honestly I'm a bit dubious - the writing seemed unimpressive in the trailer
[10/12/17, 10:15:26 AM] <YuriKitten> I've already seen some apparent deviation from the actual history of the Marstons just in the trailer, but I'm still looking forward to it.
[10/12/17, 10:15:29 AM] <phoenixgoth> So many suggestions on Discord, dears
[10/12/17, 10:15:31 AM] <UncleOok> and bill finger, @chuckytheclown11
[10/12/17, 10:15:36 AM] <runningfool11> Is the color on this camera off?
[10/12/17, 10:15:37 AM] <rasnac_khan> Taliesin's Lost Mohawk!
[10/12/17, 10:15:40 AM] <stargazer1977> There won't be an Alan Moore biopic until after he's dead. He won't let it happen until then.
[10/12/17, 10:15:42 AM] <chuckytheclown11> indeed @UncleOok
[10/12/17, 10:15:42 AM] <misssunflower94> *crossing finger for song*
[10/12/17, 10:15:50 AM] <Pustulant> What's the P.O. Box for letters?
[10/12/17, 10:15:55 AM] <ToonEzon> what are some of the options for the letter's page so far?
[10/12/17, 10:15:56 AM] <Terraskye7> call it: "Dear Tally"
[10/12/17, 10:15:57 AM] <AromiaFlyce> WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?
[10/12/17, 10:16:00 AM] <JustinTotino> How about simply, "The Wednesday letter Column"?
[10/12/17, 10:16:03 AM] <Saraphys> needs?
[10/12/17, 10:16:04 AM] <mogodontsocialize> aww
[10/12/17, 10:16:04 AM] <KristynEStart> If you mix straight from the tube acrylic paints with Iridescent medium you can go over the shirt colors to get that crystal/shivering/holographic-ish finish.
[10/12/17, 10:16:05 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> Oooohhh.

[10/12/17, 10:16:08 AM] <cinphoria> Here's the current list of Discord suggestions https://pastebin.com/f5gJnvUi
[10/12/17, 10:16:11 AM] <Fu4ow> @stargazer1977 certainly, but I wonder how long afterward
[10/12/17, 10:16:12 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @Fu4ow If there is then it'll most likely be unofficial since I doubt Alan Moore will ever sign off on a official one
[10/12/17, 10:16:15 AM] <UncleOok> Still like "Gone Clubbing"
[10/12/17, 10:16:17 AM] <RMutt1917> @chuckytheclown11 @UncleOok Have you seen the Batman and Bill doc on Hulu?
[10/12/17, 10:16:18 AM] <tara_the_cat> The Wednesdaisy Meadow?
