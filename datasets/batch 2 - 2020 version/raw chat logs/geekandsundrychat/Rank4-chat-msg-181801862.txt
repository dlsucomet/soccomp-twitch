[10/13/17, 9:53:28 AM] <Wyze2099> @ianbealio The player characters are a long-running adventuring party called Vox Machina. They have a variety or personalities and backgrounds, but they’ve become a family over time. They’ve rescued a paladin from the Underdark, fought Beholders, undead aristocrats, an organization of dragons called the Chroma Conclave, and currently, a mortal ascended into a god.
