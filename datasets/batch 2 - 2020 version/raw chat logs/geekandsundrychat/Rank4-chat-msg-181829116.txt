[10/13/17, 7:01:49 AM] <chaoticloony> Morrowind is what turned me off the series, i still prefer Daggerfall
[10/13/17, 7:02:08 AM] <reverseaquamath> My intro was Oblivion

[10/13/17, 7:02:23 AM] <wakiki067> i liked morrowind
[10/13/17, 7:02:33 AM] <stargazer1977> If this episode was filmed about 4-5 years ago, I would have been super hyped. But after The Witcher 2 and especially The Witcher 3, I'm not much of an Elder Scroll fan any more.
[10/13/17, 7:02:39 AM] <ColdK_TV> gandsRaid gandsRaid gandsRaid gandsRaid
[10/13/17, 7:02:43 AM] <stargazer1977> The games are still good, but they are no where near The Witcher series.
[10/13/17, 7:02:44 AM] <magicthighs> I loved morrowind, actually started playing it again a week ago ^^
[10/13/17, 7:02:49 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[10/13/17, 7:03:05 AM] <DecafToaster> Scroll of Icarian Flight.
[10/13/17, 7:03:17 AM] <DecafToaster> He didn't think about slow fall afterwards.
[10/13/17, 7:03:21 AM] <Ossborn> Morrowind for me.... but I didnt understand it back then, the open world overwhelmed me and I didnt touch it foor many years
[10/13/17, 7:03:30 AM] <Compel_Bast> hello
[10/13/17, 7:03:51 AM] <nikolbolas> Hmm I think I’m the wrong channel :( where’s the critical role chann?
[10/13/17, 7:03:58 AM] <Danoba> !wheniscr
[10/13/17, 7:03:58 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role is on at 7 PM PDT on Thursdays, it is currently 4:03 PM PDT on Thursday. There is 2 Hours, 56 Minutes, 2 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 517 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[10/13/17, 7:04:04 AM] <ElRoboRick> Love me some Elder Scrolls :D
[10/13/17, 7:04:07 AM] <JindoDargo> hi
[10/13/17, 7:04:11 AM] <magicthighs> this is it, nikobolas, critrole starts in 3 hours
[10/13/17, 7:04:14 AM] <nikolbolas> Ooh pdt ty
[10/13/17, 7:04:16 AM] <Ossborn> This isnt a 24/7 CR channel
[10/13/17, 7:04:19 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I started with Morrowind as well.
[10/13/17, 7:04:22 AM] <iccotak> Destiny could learn from Elder Scrolls
[10/13/17, 7:04:30 AM] <hellocommanderstone> This honestly sounds just like me with Skyrim, glad im not alone lol
[10/13/17, 7:04:41 AM] <IrishPyrate13> playing skyrim atm
[10/13/17, 7:04:43 AM] <MC_Thanks> What's with the airplane engine in the audio?
[10/13/17, 7:04:43 AM] <RoboTechFrog> Morrowind hype! Tried to play on my parents Pentium 3 cpu. 3FPS and still played for months.
[10/13/17, 7:04:44 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I played so much Morrowind I broke the fight AI of everything. @GeekandSundry
[10/13/17, 7:04:45 AM] <Compel_Bast> I came to Morrowind years after it was originally released and even then, with a texture pack, it was incredibly impressive
[10/13/17, 7:04:48 AM] <DomiThicck> Haha "Kill that person, Why Not??"
[10/13/17, 7:04:57 AM] <reverseaquamath> The hardest part of any Elder Scrolls game is starting
[10/13/17, 7:05:11 AM] <remuladgryta> morrowing had some pretty clunky combat mechanics, but otherwise it was pretty great
[10/13/17, 7:05:13 AM] <InventoryFullPT> I agree @iccotak
[10/13/17, 7:05:22 AM] <remuladgryta> morrowind*
[10/13/17, 7:05:25 AM] <magicthighs> there's some really cool morrowind speedruns
[10/13/17, 7:05:33 AM] <DecafToaster> The clunky combat mechanics are the beautiful part. Background dice rolling.
[10/13/17, 7:05:34 AM] <Lordkfearnar> playing skyrim right now hehe thats kind of funny :) i was see that G&S is on and i came see what is on :P
[10/13/17, 7:05:47 AM] <Droid_Sensei> why is someone vacuuming in the background
[10/13/17, 7:05:56 AM] <stargazer1977> The combat in all TES games has not been that interesting to me. The worlds are cool, but the combat has always been lackluster. Skyrim made some improvements but a lot of other series are more my style.
[10/13/17, 7:05:56 AM] <DecafToaster> I think it may be the laptop fan.
[10/13/17, 7:06:01 AM] <LainLoki> there's a bit staticky whistling sound
[10/13/17, 7:06:03 AM] <reverseaquamath> Prince of the Hunt?
[10/13/17, 7:06:03 AM] <Saraphys> Daedric God of the Hunt
[10/13/17, 7:06:08 AM] <consuela3> cleaning up the glitter
[10/13/17, 7:06:12 AM] <reverseaquamath> Patron of Werewolves

[10/13/17, 7:06:22 AM] <Bounce0606> schedule?
[10/13/17, 7:06:23 AM] <V1ru6> I was first disappointed with Morrowind because I played Daggerfall before. Though, I was sold with the Art direction.
[10/13/17, 7:06:27 AM] <Jankonia> background noise is louder than his mic :-/
[10/13/17, 7:06:28 AM] <Compel_Bast> Like an evil version of Orion

[10/13/17, 7:06:30 AM] <chaoticloony> I finished Arena, but never finished Daggerfall, spent too much time exploring
[10/13/17, 7:06:40 AM] <Ezii_SH> i thuoght that was a vacuum lol
[10/13/17, 7:06:43 AM] <chaoticloony> hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[10/13/17, 7:06:46 AM] <DecafToaster> I know my laptop fan sounds, I guess. :p
[10/13/17, 7:07:05 AM] <iccotak> Herma Mora is my fave
[10/13/17, 7:07:22 AM] <reverseaquamath> Mora is very....lovecraft
[10/13/17, 7:07:26 AM] <DomiThicck> Uh Oh
[10/13/17, 7:07:28 AM] <LainLoki> oh no
[10/13/17, 7:07:30 AM] <wakiki067> wow
[10/13/17, 7:07:31 AM] <Leigh574> oopsies lol

[10/13/17, 7:07:59 AM] <Saraphys> OMG! Thats so sad, Ryan!!!
[10/13/17, 7:08:02 AM] <remuladgryta> Namira best daedric prince, beggar prince best book
[10/13/17, 7:08:07 AM] <wakiki067> that would kill me
[10/13/17, 7:08:17 AM] <iccotak> 2/3 of a year gone
[10/13/17, 7:08:22 AM] <LainLoki> I miss that feature
[10/13/17, 7:08:23 AM] <V1ru6> Yeah Daggerfall was HUGE. I lost several time before understanding that time was ACTUALLY passing storywise.
[10/13/17, 7:08:23 AM] <Jankonia> you cant talk so quiet RyGuy. maybe move the mic up your vest a bit :-D
[10/13/17, 7:08:25 AM] <reverseaquamath> Sheogorath is best Daedra
[10/13/17, 7:08:29 AM] <killbuzz120> i started with morrowind myself. I hadn't even heard of it before, but my dad has a box of PC games, that he just without looking at it gave to me. In there was Morrowind and The Witcher. He did not see me for days :)
[10/13/17, 7:08:33 AM] <DecafToaster> I recently learned that you can sort the journal entries by quest... I've been playing since release. And I just found this out. >_>
[10/13/17, 7:08:34 AM] <Zismarith> Darn those early Xboxes anyway!
[10/13/17, 7:08:39 AM] <LainLoki> the jounral had it's own personal touch
[10/13/17, 7:08:46 AM] <Compel_Bast> I still sometimes go into Skyrim to just ride back and forth across the map for relaxing
[10/13/17, 7:08:59 AM] <remuladgryta> morrowind on PC has the construction set though, so technically it's pretty much as open for modding as oblivion
[10/13/17, 7:09:06 AM] <CosmicVoyagerX> Volume keeps ging down and up and down
[10/13/17, 7:09:27 AM] <Zismarith> My mom would never have gone for it
[10/13/17, 7:09:37 AM] <BlackMemberAC> 3 hours!!!!
[10/13/17, 7:09:41 AM] <DecafToaster> The melody carries so much nostalgia. Even on ESO which I recently got.
[10/13/17, 7:09:42 AM] <magicthighs> I get flashbacks of morrowind when watching CR because Matt uses the music a lot XD
[10/13/17, 7:09:49 AM] <omega_bunny> I love the way they maintained the 'feel' of the melody through the ES series.. it's very much in vein with a cinematic series retaining a familiar theme throughout.
[10/13/17, 7:09:51 AM] <iccotak> when ES6 finally happens and he hears that tune...
[10/13/17, 7:09:56 AM] <LiberatedPhoenix> This man is an encyclopedia on everything Elder Scrolls.
