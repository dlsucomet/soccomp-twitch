[10/18/17, 9:32:27 AM] <Baanth> @Dragonchrome Not knocking them I love what they do just as much. I can have more than one favourite person
[10/18/17, 9:32:39 AM] <Zepwolfx> Who thinks they need an 8th player? I personally think Ashly from the one-shots would be great.
[10/18/17, 9:32:46 AM] <BladedBuzzer> no
[10/18/17, 9:32:47 AM] <Baanth> ^ A fellow Ottawa person
[10/18/17, 9:32:54 AM] <BladedBuzzer> 8 is too many
[10/18/17, 9:33:01 AM] <KitMarcus> "When God closes one door, He opens a window"....Favorite saying from my upbringing
[10/18/17, 9:33:06 AM] <t3asn0b> Hi oFussyWuzzy :)
[10/18/17, 9:33:16 AM] <Leather69> Oh and just for feels factor, Look up Ravens and behaveior, Lot of Vax like qualities
[10/18/17, 9:33:17 AM] <Gunnerblaster> I've always wondered how things would've turned out if Orian didn't have to leave. Tiberius was such a fun personality.
[10/18/17, 9:33:19 AM] <t3asn0b> Yeah, i think 8 is to many
[10/18/17, 9:33:20 AM] <oh_bother> this is different, PANIC
[10/18/17, 9:33:21 AM] <Lucifer753> <3

[10/18/17, 9:33:28 AM] <blackbelt_drummer> Howdy, Bidet!
[10/18/17, 9:33:29 AM] <KitMarcus> Zepwolfx They did 8 players... before Orion left.
[10/18/17, 9:33:33 AM] <Littleliger07> <3
[10/18/17, 9:33:37 AM] <jpcguy89> It depends...8 is just fine if the group is works well together like VM does
[10/18/17, 9:33:39 AM] <t3asn0b> I dunno how he does it

[10/18/17, 9:34:36 AM] <Gunnerblaster> Tbh, Matt's a beast. Being able to handle 7-8 players and prevent the campaign from being one big murder hobo, as well as still giving the players enough time to develop themselves and their individual stories.

[10/18/17, 9:35:22 AM] <Purplebreeze80> Matt is a savant I think, takes a special kind of talent\ability
[10/18/17, 9:35:26 AM] <Lucifer753> I'd say keep the formula as it has been, norm crew w/ guests sprinkled here and there

[10/18/17, 9:36:31 AM] <Dragonchrome> @oFuzzywuzzy it takes a hot minute or so to process , give it 5 mins and you should be good
[10/18/17, 9:36:31 AM] <rmclair> Beep Beep
[10/18/17, 9:36:34 AM] <draxifiel> @Leather69 what kind of changes for roles are you wanting?
[10/18/17, 9:36:39 AM] <Gunnerblaster> @BladedBuzzer I had an interesting idea for a campaign - Have the players unknowingly play an evil and a good campaign, separate characters, then have them clash
[10/18/17, 9:36:39 AM] <Grimswerth> the crew is working really hard I see
[10/18/17, 9:36:40 AM] <t3asn0b> The world lives on so I think Bidet is acceptable
[10/18/17, 9:36:40 AM] <Lucifer753> who are these strange folks in BWFs house?!?

[10/18/17, 9:36:57 AM] <Solangel777> What I want is Grogs Beep Beep or Bidet to be a slang greeting all over exandria
[10/18/17, 9:36:59 AM] <Coranassa> @KitMarcus I agree!!! :)

[10/18/17, 9:37:40 AM] <jpcguy89> I think I’m going to miss Grog most. Travis played him so well
[10/18/17, 9:37:42 AM] <BigSpoon223> I want a full Paladin in the next campaign
[10/18/17, 9:37:44 AM] <Meagan_Britbrit> I thought &'s didn't work in hashtags?

[10/18/17, 9:37:48 AM] <Solangel777> @Leather69 Travis as a wise Monk
[10/18/17, 9:37:50 AM] <guyute77> I bet Travis goes Blood Hunter
[10/18/17, 9:38:02 AM] <Leather69> We still get Travis, and He is amzaing
[10/18/17, 9:38:05 AM] <Zepwolfx> Any wishlist for character per players?
[10/18/17, 9:38:06 AM] <BladedBuzzer> evil oneshot id be downfor but campaign is not what i personally would want
[10/18/17, 9:38:11 AM] <t3asn0b> I wish Grog had more interactions. Travis always has the best replies
[10/18/17, 9:38:13 AM] <KitMarcus> I can see Liam being a cleric.
[10/18/17, 9:38:14 AM] <Leather69> Yeah, but want him out of tank role
[10/18/17, 9:38:14 AM] <GreenishPtero> I bet Kiki will make an appearance as npc

[10/18/17, 9:38:16 AM] <ZweihanderKnight> @guyute77 So like bringing over his Blood Hunter from the oneshots over? o.0
[10/18/17, 9:38:17 AM] <Gibralter> weren't they supposed to
[10/18/17, 9:38:21 AM] <Gunnerblaster> Not gonna lie - Paladin's are pretty, uh, OP in 5e vanilla.

[10/18/17, 9:38:38 AM] <Purplebreeze80> Yeah could see liam as a cleric
[10/18/17, 9:38:40 AM] <Gunnerblaster> @GreenishPtero I don't doubt it considering she's going to live for over 1000 years.
[10/18/17, 9:38:45 AM] <Solangel777> @Leather69 monks are not tanky. i nearly died 3 times in 12 sessions on my monk.
[10/18/17, 9:38:46 AM] <Leather69> Talison has a new one allready, I am sure its not a book based class LOL
[10/18/17, 9:38:51 AM] <JonusOctavian> I don't care what Travis plays, as long as he's able to directly use the tactical mind he obviously has.
[10/18/17, 9:38:51 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> I'll miss scanlan!!~~~~
[10/18/17, 9:38:51 AM] <zonkedpassenger> I bet travis doesn't "Laser mic ftw"

[10/18/17, 9:38:52 AM] <BigSpoon223> I don't know about OP @MKrawchuk but it is definitely a powerhouse in melee as long as they've got spell slots
[10/18/17, 9:38:52 AM] <MiruKanaMoonie> It'll be weird not having the siblings for suure
[10/18/17, 9:38:54 AM] <Dasbif> just brought it up with the team @jimmy_eat_meatloaf , not sure which of the people competent at such things are available at the moment. but we can certainly try!
[10/18/17, 9:38:59 AM] <draxifiel> @ZweihanderKnight pretty sure the bloodhunter class is part of the book so maybe

[10/18/17, 9:40:18 AM] <Gunnerblaster> Evil campaigns are fun but they're very one-sided for the audience.

[10/18/17, 9:40:20 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role will continue airing on Thursdays at the regular time. There will be one-shots and other fun things until the end of the year, and then in January a new campaign will begin, set 20 years after the story of Vox Machina. Don't worry, Critters, the show isn't going anywhere. ❤

[10/18/17, 9:42:03 AM] <Dasbif> I am LITERALLY still occasionally recoiling or grimacing after that experience.
[10/18/17, 9:42:06 AM] <GreenishPtero> the neck chapter
[10/18/17, 9:42:08 AM] <Gunnerblaster> @Leather69 Yea they probably weren't planning on being such a huge hit.
