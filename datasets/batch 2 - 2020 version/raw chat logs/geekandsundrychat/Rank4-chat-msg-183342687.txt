[10/19/17, 7:21:34 AM] <CodeBeholder> crit role one shot, trinket goes on a train heist
[10/19/17, 7:21:35 AM] <chaoticloony> Just remember that although many of the hosts of the channel are attractive, there's much more to them than that. For example, Becca is also incredibly evil.
[10/19/17, 7:21:42 AM] <Davecom3> I thought the sheriff was just trying to stop the robbers.
[10/19/17, 7:21:50 AM] <EmceeZackLA> that was funny
