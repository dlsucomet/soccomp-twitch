[10/19/17, 10:09:03 AM] <Slippydude> PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Taliesin TAL (like Tal'dorei) I.E. SIN (cause its Taliesin, there's obviously sin in there)
[10/19/17, 10:09:10 AM] <MeggieMay328> I'm not counting on them being able to make it and that's very very cool (weddings are big huge engery drains, among other things)
[10/19/17, 10:09:15 AM] <Chucky_Larms> I've LARPed VtM. But does the tabletop roll dice or is it paper rock scissors?
[10/19/17, 10:09:16 AM] <Kol_Drake> Taliesin was Goth before it got to be a 'thing'.

[10/19/17, 10:11:33 AM] <halfaringcircus> Matt. This is not a Strange episode.

[10/19/17, 10:12:19 AM] <owifig> Amy's gauge for table usefulness is "Can you reach the M&M's?"
[10/19/17, 10:12:19 AM] <CorwinC73> but is he the best man or a bridesmaid? :)
[10/19/17, 10:12:43 AM] <orlliie> Tal is officiating the wedding

[10/19/17, 10:12:49 AM] <Kol_Drake> @owifig your gauge isn't all about M&Ms?
[10/19/17, 10:12:51 AM] <halfaringcircus> @japenrose Someone needs to call him on it. Get your own spinoff Dr. Strange. Stop hogging the main show.
[10/19/17, 10:12:54 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION (that they'll no doubt get to): What Hellboy do we start with

[10/19/17, 10:14:12 AM] <Slippydude> I'm pretty sure that Comixology is lowkey tuning in to WC and setting sales on their comics
[10/19/17, 10:14:18 AM] <cinphoria> that's what this show is for, Liam ;)
[10/19/17, 10:14:18 AM] <jherchin12345> go, ramble!

[10/19/17, 10:14:34 AM] <chiplickin> DO SO, LIAM
[10/19/17, 10:14:42 AM] <Noahlikespie> Glanderson booper
[10/19/17, 10:14:43 AM] <Kol_Drake> Obviously, Liam didn't watch when Hector came on and 'rambled like a fanboi'.
[10/19/17, 10:14:45 AM] <stargazer1977> Lol, Liam is so self depreciating, he's worried about doing what he was brought on the show to do. :)
[10/19/17, 10:14:48 AM] <wizardofsouls> glanderson booper!
[10/19/17, 10:14:50 AM] <Chovexani> Delightful Rambling is very on brand for TWC

[10/19/17, 10:14:55 AM] <CorwinC73> hahaha... I wonder what Marisha has Liam wearing as a bridemaid... elegant dress? Or a dress that makes herself look better" :P
[10/19/17, 10:14:56 AM] <Kol_Drake> Most excellent arts.
[10/19/17, 10:15:00 AM] <SharkyShocker> Is that chalk?!? :o
[10/19/17, 10:15:01 AM] <darkhalfelf284> You guys should talk about Inhumans or Gifted one day, since the TV shows are out now.
[10/19/17, 10:15:02 AM] <cinphoria> did he just say "de Rolo" the conversation?
[10/19/17, 10:15:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> You know, Liam does such a great job on Critical Role, that it's easy to forget he's just a big ol' geek like us. <3

[10/19/17, 10:19:23 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @misssunflower94 The first movie adapts a lot of elements from different comic (especially the first book "Seed of Destruction") The second film is "mostly it's own story and doesn't really adapt anything from the comics except for one or two characters :)
[10/19/17, 10:19:23 AM] <RMutt1917> @Kol_Drake there has been a lot of subsequent collections, since the original, by many other comics authors
