[10/24/17, 10:11:02 AM] <DANfan69> Since we can't see you, is Sam gonna keep count on how many times she breaks a pencil?
[10/24/17, 10:11:02 AM] <Salbastro> @WormholeXtreme9 it should be ready tomorrow :P
[10/24/17, 10:11:03 AM] <stargazer1977> They are not normally this late, but they are missing 2 cast and 1 other is having a really difficult time getting there.
[10/24/17, 10:11:08 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> now an entire tv show based on the mirror universe. that'd be interesting

[10/24/17, 10:13:45 AM] <Cadmandu2000> After following on Twitter, I am surprised both Library Bards made it.
[10/24/17, 10:13:45 AM] <EricaTheStrange> just like sheldon that's your spot @DeLevely
[10/24/17, 10:13:54 AM] <DeLevely> @Chovexani I like that interpretation
[10/24/17, 10:13:54 AM] <highvoltage988> @Paladin356 not really, Xander's uniform isn't from the same source I believe so it's not quite the same tone
[10/24/17, 10:13:56 AM] <SynapticWanderer> sto with sot! sweet! :)
[10/24/17, 10:13:58 AM] <allenshock1> Sam, are you excited?

[10/24/17, 10:14:56 AM] <Vance1982> Eric's pips not in proper postition
[10/24/17, 10:14:58 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> 1st season TNG uniforms must have been the most confomrtable
[10/24/17, 10:14:58 AM] <Mishoniko> Who got the WDYWTDT?
[10/24/17, 10:14:59 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Okay, I'm not one to understand, but rolling initiative on vows? That's pretty great. XD
[10/24/17, 10:15:00 AM] <HalfDonut> I friggin love the uniforms.
[10/24/17, 10:15:02 AM] <DeLevely> I adore the uniforms tho
[10/24/17, 10:15:03 AM] <NitemarePhoenix> someone let Eric know his pips have nearly jumped ship...
[10/24/17, 10:15:08 AM] <Nightbot> Don't forget to visit Star Trek Online and support Shield of Tomorrow! www.StarTrekOnline.com/ShieldofTomorrow
[10/24/17, 10:15:10 AM] <Trekkie313> They don';t make sense in the timeline :(
[10/24/17, 10:15:10 AM] <HalfDonut> I want to buy one of the uniforms, but it's 500 dollars
[10/24/17, 10:15:14 AM] <Trekkie313> TIMELINE

[10/24/17, 10:15:20 AM] <allenshock1> Tilly rocks
[10/24/17, 10:15:32 AM] <starpilotsix> I was pleased to see Wilson Cruz as the doctor, I loved My So-Called Life when I was younger.
[10/24/17, 10:15:33 AM] <dangerouswonder417> Xander!!!
[10/24/17, 10:15:36 AM] <Salbastro> Hey Eric: Did the one presiding over the wedding ask "How Do You Wanna Do This?"
[10/24/17, 10:15:37 AM] <highvoltage988> @WormholeXtreme9 actually one of the reasons they changed it for Season 3 is it was giving the cast back problems
[10/24/17, 10:15:40 AM] <enca24> wohoo!
[10/24/17, 10:15:48 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> vieHype Captain Martinez vieHype

[10/24/17, 10:16:10 AM] <Chovexani> I'm upset I can't see Discovery .. I don't have -anymore- entertainment money after Netflix, Twitch, Alpha and Hulu
[10/24/17, 10:16:11 AM] <stargazer1977> @DeLevely sadly I'm not a fan of Discovery, it's just not what I want out of Star Trek. But that makes me even more thankful for your show. It is exactly what I want and makes me not nearly as disappointed in the other. So thank you for that. <3
[10/24/17, 10:16:13 AM] <Glimjii> Console? Like Xbox? :D PlayStation? :D
[10/24/17, 10:16:15 AM] <enca24> @eric ok sam has ther epencils we can start properly now

[10/24/17, 10:16:25 AM] <highvoltage988> @WormholeXtreme9 ah okay makes sense now :D
[10/24/17, 10:16:28 AM] <MrPingn> Many pencils were harmed in the making of this show
[10/24/17, 10:16:39 AM] <Salbastro> @RJLadyA That doesnt answer the important question there :P
[10/24/17, 10:16:42 AM] <JeffM0307> DANG

[10/24/17, 10:16:50 AM] <DeLevely> @HalfDonut waaaaaaaant! but they don't make uniforms smol enough for me :D
[10/24/17, 10:16:54 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> being disturbed is a good sign
[10/24/17, 10:16:55 AM] <DANfan69> So Metal \m/

[10/24/17, 10:17:16 AM] <RJLadyA> @salbastro lol true but it was their day so i dont want to know.
[10/24/17, 10:17:20 AM] <HalfDonut> @DeLevely Same, but I need a larger size, and the price is kinda out of my range :( Which is a shame, because I totally want one.
[10/24/17, 10:17:21 AM] <Vance1982> I use Hotspot Shield VPN
[10/24/17, 10:17:24 AM] <Themaddanielz> best Halloween indeed
[10/24/17, 10:17:41 AM] <gogt200> I feel Bonnie and Xander's pain. Myself and one of my partners took a bus to and from Iowa to Seattle. 36 hours there, 42 back. It suuuuucked. Especially when you have agoraphobia. XD
[10/24/17, 10:17:42 AM] <Salbastro> I wanna know! I want them to share all their wedding photos! (if they want to)
[10/24/17, 10:17:44 AM] <JeffM0307> That looks like Jenga :P
[10/24/17, 10:17:55 AM] <FlavahText> we are missing some people...
[10/24/17, 10:17:56 AM] <JustinT1977> So pumped for Stranger Things Season 2 on Friday
[10/24/17, 10:17:58 AM] <DeLevely> Aliza is too amazing. It's a problem
[10/24/17, 10:17:58 AM] <stom02> I don't think there is a Fleet on PS4
[10/24/17, 10:18:01 AM] <Trekkie313> Comic Con? She means next year right
[10/24/17, 10:18:02 AM] <Paladin356> So during break, I'm going to jump onto pS4 STO and try to get the fleet jump started
[10/24/17, 10:18:04 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> Dr Crusher isn't there? :(
[10/24/17, 10:18:09 AM] <hellocommanderstone> thats rough, everything good always overlaps at Comic Cons
[10/24/17, 10:18:14 AM] <starpilotsix> I believed a well-timed transporter malfunction can help you with this problem.
[10/24/17, 10:18:16 AM] <Paladin356> stormthrooper im trying to get it jump started
[10/24/17, 10:18:16 AM] <Cloud_Rise> gandsHR gandsHR gandsHR gandsHR gandsHR gandsHR

[10/24/17, 10:21:22 AM] <rijaxbloodmore> Admiral knows all
[10/24/17, 10:21:23 AM] <tomservo544> Oh hai Xander
[10/24/17, 10:21:26 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @DeLevely I shouldn't be encouraging this, but just in case any pencils get snapped by you tonight, you should post Twittter pics of them. Everyone needs to know the price of what happens when they upset you when you're not there ;)
[10/24/17, 10:21:27 AM] <Echo__12> Good GMs know all
[10/24/17, 10:21:29 AM] <catseye91> Puppy cuddles <3
[10/24/17, 10:21:33 AM] <highvoltage988> @DeLevely the GM is all-knowing, of course!
[10/24/17, 10:21:34 AM] <Glimjii> @DeLevely Eric is just that damn good of a GM ;)
[10/24/17, 10:21:39 AM] <FlavahText> I just have to be willing to widen the invite list...
[10/24/17, 10:21:39 AM] <Echo__12> That's why I don't know nothing!
[10/24/17, 10:21:40 AM] <RJLadyA> @ricky_galletti yes!
[10/24/17, 10:21:43 AM] <CyBearRedPanda> Sam also has the support of her fans... that is like spinach!
[10/24/17, 10:21:48 AM] <talahar> gosh darn scifi zombies.
[10/24/17, 10:21:51 AM] <DeLevely> @Ricky_Galletti They are on standby, and I will do that for the sake of SoT stats
[10/24/17, 10:21:54 AM] <Crikeuh_> wtf is this
[10/24/17, 10:21:56 AM] <HalfDonut> @DeLevely Tristian's took your spot next to your Captain. How does Rue feel about people in their seat?

[10/24/17, 10:22:01 AM] <allenshock1> my wife was talking about Rue, asked me if she was a Tribble. ..she meant Trill
[10/24/17, 10:22:04 AM] <derekleeketchum> @cybearredpanda their* fans
[10/24/17, 10:22:04 AM] <Cloud_Rise> I've always said Eric is Q. How else would you explain his omniscience?
[10/24/17, 10:22:07 AM] <EricaTheStrange> GM's are supposed to be all knowing @DeLevely
[10/24/17, 10:22:13 AM] <JeffM0307> The Trekking Dead happened
[10/24/17, 10:22:13 AM] <Themaddanielz> thanks sam
[10/24/17, 10:22:16 AM] <CyBearRedPanda> oops sorry.
[10/24/17, 10:22:18 AM] <DeLevely> @HalfDonut They don't sit when they're on the bridge, they stand, so I don't think they feel partial
[10/24/17, 10:22:18 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> Eric is John?
[10/24/17, 10:22:19 AM] <Vance1982> *They
