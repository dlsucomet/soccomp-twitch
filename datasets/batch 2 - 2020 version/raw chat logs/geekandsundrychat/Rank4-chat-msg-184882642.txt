[10/25/17, 9:51:57 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role will continue airing on Thursdays at the regular time. There will be one-shots and other fun things until the end of the year, and then in January a new campaign will begin, set 20 years after the story of Vox Machina. Don't worry, Critters, the show isn't going anywhere. ❤

[10/25/17, 9:55:54 AM] <stargazer1977> Matt and Marisha are still on their honeymoon. I wouldn't plan on the complete wrap up until possibly the week after the final Battle Royale. They will be talking about the Taliesin 1 shot this week, and probably next week as well. It makes logical sense.

[10/25/17, 9:58:15 AM] <cookingdaddy> @AkemixPanda We play on roll 20, and I spend many hours a week creating a world for them to explore and do things in. And half of them dont seem interested in it. They seem more interested in "shipping" their characters with eachother. One tried to demand more magical items for themself
[10/25/17, 9:58:15 AM] <McLurkey> I'm assuming their early departure last week was part of the plan.

[10/25/17, 9:58:52 AM] <KarraChr000> In Taliesin's defense, "stanima" is not just a commonly misspoken word, but is often intentionally spoken like that.

[10/25/17, 10:00:18 AM] <RogueKittenCrafter> @Hydroplainbagel Ouch... I think maybe you can try and throwing them into a dungeon that has magical items but make it so hard that i is nearly impossible to get them. And the shipping i would say create a STD like thing that will prevent it from happening if you want to prevent it but idk just a suggestion
