[10/31/17, 10:17:50 AM] <Liselle129> Good evening, all! I need to go to bed soon, but I wanted to say hello.
[10/31/17, 10:17:52 AM] <cinphoria> better give it to someone who'll be SUPER EXCITED
[10/31/17, 10:17:55 AM] <damocles_74> thats the Code of Acquisition!

[10/31/17, 10:18:12 AM] <talahar> having a lifetime sub in STO is also really rad. I bought the lifetime sub back in beta, and ever since I get a handful of c-points/zen every month
[10/31/17, 10:18:16 AM] <dndjester> @ShandraVdeG Mirror Universe oneshot incoming in a future week
[10/31/17, 10:18:32 AM] <Trekkie313> So why is Sam absent>
[10/31/17, 10:18:33 AM] <MrPingn> @chiplickin I bet whoever it is will do more than forgetting where they put a star system
[10/31/17, 10:18:35 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> Gina certainly seems to :D And for the record, I do love's me folks in uniform!
[10/31/17, 10:18:39 AM] <Zismarith> Sam has NO idea what we're talking about. *snap*

[10/31/17, 10:19:31 AM] <Blizzard36> Yeah, I love my STO lifetime sub. They effectively pay ME when I log in now.
[10/31/17, 10:19:50 AM] <rickbudd> @ricky_galletti Can neither confirm nor deny.
[10/31/17, 10:19:56 AM] <gogt200> @CiaraTheBraid Yup! Exactly what I said. :3
[10/31/17, 10:19:56 AM] <Glimjii> Well done. *claps*
[10/31/17, 10:19:59 AM] <dndjester> I should have gotten lifetime. It would have saved me money...

[10/31/17, 10:21:21 AM] <gogt200> @CiaraTheBraid A lot of people have no idea what "top surgery" refers to. It differs a lot from person to person. My top surgery for instance would be different from Sam's top surgery.
[10/31/17, 10:21:23 AM] <amnotr2> that's Character Sheets: The Next Generation

[10/31/17, 10:22:11 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> @gogt200 They don't really need to know the details, and saying "top surgery" avoids potentially dysphoria-inducing words. So... the phrasing is important.
