[11/3/17, 7:04:57 AM] <GrimScience> His tie knots are always amazing.
[11/3/17, 7:06:46 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> Also most comic book stores are locally owned and you're supporting the person behind the counter
[11/3/17, 7:06:53 AM] <vassagovine> dat couch tho
[11/3/17, 7:07:32 AM] <vassagovine> ðŸ‘Œ matching shirt? dope
[11/3/17, 7:07:40 AM] <Chovexani> Sooo are we naming that dope goth couch?
[11/3/17, 7:08:03 AM] <Chovexani> Seetin Von Couch?
[11/3/17, 7:08:11 AM] <BillyKidd007> instead of forcing diversity into comics, I think Marvel could get a resurgence, if they reboot their universe and have the characters, die, and pass on the mantle to next generation
[11/3/17, 7:08:38 AM] <vassagovine> Brian Wayne Futon
[11/3/17, 7:08:42 AM] <DEATHlikescats> this new set is a perfect intermediary for this and AYBGF
[11/3/17, 7:08:44 AM] <BillyKidd007> *age, die and pass on
[11/3/17, 7:09:00 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> Is G & S revamping all their sets?
[11/3/17, 7:09:37 AM] <DocoRock> Meltdown comics is a great space.
[11/3/17, 7:09:41 AM] <The_Lich_DM> is Travis DMing tonight?
[11/3/17, 7:09:47 AM] <vassagovine> #alphamoney
[11/3/17, 7:09:58 AM] <Zismarith> @Chovexani Executivecouch?
[11/3/17, 7:10:01 AM] <starpilotsix> @The_Lich_DM No, Grog is
[11/3/17, 7:10:01 AM] <BillyKidd007> yes Lich
[11/3/17, 7:10:04 AM] <skerrman> @The_Lich_DM yes
[11/3/17, 7:10:13 AM] <wizardsquestion> yup
[11/3/17, 7:10:14 AM] <The_Lich_DM> nice thanks
[11/3/17, 7:10:38 AM] <Chovexani> BillyKidd007: instead of forcing diversity into comics, I think Marvel could get a resurgence, if they reboot their universe and have the characters, die, and pass on the mantle to next generation [ That feels like if you're into rebooting so long as the majority of the characters stay white men ? ]
[11/3/17, 7:10:42 AM] <Danoba> @WormholeXtreme9 This new set is the last of the sets as far as I know.
[11/3/17, 7:10:53 AM] <Quizzical_Haddock> lol alphamoney
[11/3/17, 7:10:57 AM] <vassagovine> Style so strong
[11/3/17, 7:11:19 AM] <Chovexani> @Zismarith I'm kinda into it but Executivecouch sounds like.. a place where 'casting' is done
[11/3/17, 7:11:21 AM] <balthazar2234> Grog is dming tonight? Oh God this is gonna be good
[11/3/17, 7:11:23 AM] <chuckytheclown11> hey guys
[11/3/17, 7:11:28 AM] <balthazar2234> Hello
[11/3/17, 7:11:29 AM] <Quizzical_Haddock> @WormholeXtreme9 lol I just watched ep "200" tonight
[11/3/17, 7:11:33 AM] <BillyKidd007> @Chovexani not at all. there are plenty of pocs and ladies in the marvel universe
[11/3/17, 7:12:08 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> @quizzical_haddock a grat classic if I do say so myself
[11/3/17, 7:12:12 AM] <vassagovine> I hope AYBGF comes back pretty similarly. Great chemistry, just keep adding
[11/3/17, 7:12:15 AM] <Zismarith> @Chovexani Hmm. I guess you would have to know the moniker "executivegoth" to get it. Otherwise it might get wasted.
[11/3/17, 7:12:16 AM] <Chovexani> plenty? the only hispanic one I could find just a couple of years ago was Wind Dancer @BillyKidd007
[11/3/17, 7:12:47 AM] <Quizzical_Haddock> @WormholeXtreme9 apparently it performed well on dvd
[11/3/17, 7:12:49 AM] <CrusaderNero> im depressed and I feel so alone and lost in life
[11/3/17, 7:13:03 AM] <BillyKidd007> couple years ago? America Chavez? One of the most OP characters in Marvel.
[11/3/17, 7:13:11 AM] <WormholeXtreme9> There is a lot more diversity with the comic book writers and artists today. It's just a matter of time before it becomes diverse organically
[11/3/17, 7:13:39 AM] <nennoh20> That's so cool.
[11/3/17, 7:13:39 AM] <vassagovine> crusadernero, hang in there, reach out for help if you need to
[11/3/17, 7:13:46 AM] <stargazer1977> That shop owner is a legend.
[11/3/17, 7:13:47 AM] <Chovexani> >.> Where is B.Dave I need someone who knows more comic stuff ... also America Chavez is one of the 'forced diversity' characters to a whole big boatload of people
