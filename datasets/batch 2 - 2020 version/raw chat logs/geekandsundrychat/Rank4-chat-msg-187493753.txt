[11/4/17, 10:04:05 AM] <starpilotsix> @WOMStv I don't follow the Alpha Twitter, but this was G&S twitter reblogging one of the cast so I thought maybe it might be accurate.

[11/4/17, 10:16:43 AM] <harberst> I sneeze multiple times consecutively every time.... it is sooooo not any percent of orgasm.
[11/4/17, 10:16:44 AM] <Bookgal12> Sneezing does not equal orgasm in my experience
[11/4/17, 10:16:57 AM] <Rocketsoup> If you sneeze with your eyes open you get snot in your eye

[11/4/17, 10:18:06 AM] <harberst> The only reason people hate monopoly is because they play it wrong. That's also the only reason monopoly lasts so wrong. Play by the rules and it's a short game.
