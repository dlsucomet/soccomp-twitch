[11/4/17, 12:03:22 PM] <Apodyopsis_> So what is the plan for critical role now? Are they just going to continue with one shots or is there a new campaign that is going to happen? (Just finished the last episode)

[11/4/17, 12:03:35 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi Kelly and players!
[11/4/17, 12:03:36 PM] <Nemisar> !critrole
[11/4/17, 12:03:36 PM] <Nightbot> Critical Role will continue airing on Thursdays at the regular time. There will be one-shots and other fun things until the end of the year, and then in January a new campaign will begin, set 20 years after the story of Vox Machina. Don't worry, Critters, the show isn't going anywhere. ❤
