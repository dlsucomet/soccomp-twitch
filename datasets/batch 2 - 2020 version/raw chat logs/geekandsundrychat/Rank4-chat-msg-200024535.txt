[11/10/17, 8:02:03 AM] <claybwell> my first post on here and I get yelled at by the chat keeper hehehe - bad bad bad
[11/10/17, 8:02:11 AM] <Dum8kid> @Shippygem While I want to be excited, the fact that they announced it with almost nothing to show for it, makes me think they just did it because they knew Battle for Azeroth was going to be underwhelmingly received.
[11/10/17, 8:02:13 AM] <uberbaldy> Hey Ryan. XD

[11/10/17, 8:03:22 AM] <stargazer1977> WoW wasn't my first MMORPG, Star Wars Galaxies was. But it was foundational and kept me into the genre.
[11/10/17, 8:03:22 AM] <Danoba> Volume was just adjusted.
[11/10/17, 8:03:23 AM] <PupGames> Can barely hear ; o;

[11/10/17, 8:04:49 AM] <stargazer1977> Elf had the best starting area, and those epic dances. :)
[11/10/17, 8:04:56 AM] <tempest_darkness> @danoba could we get a straw poll for horde or alliance
[11/10/17, 8:04:58 AM] <Sangert> vanilla gnomelock ftw

[11/10/17, 8:05:13 AM] <Dum8kid> Undead best starting zone
[11/10/17, 8:05:14 AM] <Graywolves> SMOrc Horde!
[11/10/17, 8:05:21 AM] <tempest_darkness> @danoba yes sir
[11/10/17, 8:05:42 AM] <MrNY2Cali> I haven't played WoW in sooo long, it's changed so much since before Cataclysm days

[11/10/17, 8:07:16 AM] <gingersnaps05> I started WoW because of Hearthstone. I didn't get much past the like tutorial. I'm wanting to get back into it, though.
[11/10/17, 8:07:33 AM] <stargazer1977> All the "cool kids" are the horde players, but I don't care. I prefer Alliance.
[11/10/17, 8:07:51 AM] <talahar> @Danoba I play both, poll is broken :p
[11/10/17, 8:07:55 AM] <ZachHall> Never really gotten too far into playing WoW, think I never leveled before 40 or so.
[11/10/17, 8:07:55 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub HYPE!!!
[11/10/17, 8:08:04 AM] <Graywolves> Tauren, Orcs, and Trolls can be in my Horde
[11/10/17, 8:08:07 AM] <Danoba> @talahar Damn, that's a good point because I do the same.
[11/10/17, 8:08:10 AM] <MrNY2Cali> ahh the days were there was lvl 40 mounts and then lvl 60 epic mounts that were hard as shit to attain

[11/10/17, 8:12:07 AM] <simbini2011> was this a blizzard thing or something extra on top of the game?

[11/10/17, 8:12:51 AM] <BillyKidd007> they aren't criminials, just misunderstood
[11/10/17, 8:13:01 AM] <talahar> well, i can't afford WoW right now, but i sitll have great fun with the free edition right now. trying chars from 1 to 20 that i probably wouldn't play any further (and some that i would) but i really looking forward to get back into it
[11/10/17, 8:13:21 AM] <Osiris_slim> ok shit, honey heist looks really good
[11/10/17, 8:13:24 AM] <simbini2011> the story you're talking about with your group; was that a story that you made or was it a blizzard sanction event sort of thing?
[11/10/17, 8:13:29 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Panaria, yea I stopped before Pandas
[11/10/17, 8:13:47 AM] <The_TBoyce> I feel like I'm biased in the Horde vs. Alliance debate. I play Jaina in Hearthstone. :)
[11/10/17, 8:13:48 AM] <ShippyGem> My hunter got her wolf by getting the the boat to menethil harbour running through the the wet lands at lvl 11
[11/10/17, 8:13:51 AM] <CapnCrsy> I mean that cinematic was damn cool
[11/10/17, 8:13:55 AM] <tempest_darkness> @simbini2011 he is taking about rp servers where you live in the game as you toon not just play as them
[11/10/17, 8:14:02 AM] <RuzgofDI> Lets be honest. Before the end of Battle for Azeroth, both sides will end up fighting some third enemy again.
[11/10/17, 8:14:05 AM] <PupGames> YAAAS THE TRAILER
[11/10/17, 8:14:12 AM] <FinnBear> the way he's sitting has me constantly thinking he has a quest but he doesn't right?
[11/10/17, 8:14:13 AM] <GrimScience> Sylvanas... The Banshee Queen. So cool.
[11/10/17, 8:14:13 AM] <Lefty79> The Cinematic was better than the announcement trailer.
[11/10/17, 8:14:17 AM] <simbini2011> @tempest_darkness ah kk cheers
[11/10/17, 8:14:20 AM] <Danoba> I may have watched this a bunch of times already.
[11/10/17, 8:14:25 AM] <Vaeku> I'm not a huge fan of the premise for this expansion tbh, but I loved the cinematic and I felt such Alliance pride
[11/10/17, 8:14:26 AM] <crthemighty> SURE i'll watch this again
[11/10/17, 8:14:27 AM] <Danoba> With reactions.
[11/10/17, 8:14:32 AM] <queenjuliana> FOR THE HORDE! But I also like my Alliance Druid ;)
[11/10/17, 8:14:37 AM] <tempest_darkness> @ginquisitor we would hold it against you as long as its not quest
[11/10/17, 8:14:40 AM] <Danoba> @PaleGreenRider Yes, so much so.
[11/10/17, 8:14:45 AM] <CapnCrsy> Blizzard has basically nailed every cinematic they've ever made
[11/10/17, 8:14:45 AM] <crthemighty> 3rd war, ryan
[11/10/17, 8:14:48 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I felt let down when my shaman didn't sprinkle dust into the wind like in the intro vid
[11/10/17, 8:14:50 AM] <PupGames> @RuzgofDI The battle for Azeroth would be against the old gods towards the end, I guaranteeit
[11/10/17, 8:14:53 AM] <The_TBoyce> I didn't get a chance to go to BlizzCon this year, so this is my first time seeing it!
[11/10/17, 8:14:54 AM] <tempest_darkness> @ginquisitor won't

[11/10/17, 8:15:32 AM] <crthemighty> once upon a time, i wanted to work at blizz soley because their cinematics are so great
[11/10/17, 8:15:42 AM] <filip97x> To be honest we don't know much about Battle for Azeroth as we just found out Sylvanas has something to do with burning one of the Night Elf world trees before the attack on Lorderon.... And No it was in warcraft 3 as Arthas took it over for the scurge not the forsaken, the forsaken did not exist yet !!!!!!!!!
[11/10/17, 8:15:51 AM] <JT_Jag> blizz cinematics and music are really good
