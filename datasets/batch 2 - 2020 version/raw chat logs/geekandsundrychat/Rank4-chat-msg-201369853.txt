[11/15/17, 8:04:16 AM] <Nightbot> There are no grills in the studio. There are girls, although they usually prefer to be called skull crushing immortals. If you are seeing grills where none exist, you should see a doctor. However, Ryan did put a grill in the back of the studio for when he wants to cook vegetable fajitas so that one is okay.
[11/15/17, 8:04:24 AM] <cinphoria> maow
[11/15/17, 8:04:29 AM] <FuffyButt> no agreed with me Miss pac man

[11/15/17, 8:04:59 AM] <JeffM0307> Hello, folks
[11/15/17, 8:05:00 AM] <stargazer1977> I like the Yuna in X-2 more than X, but she's still a good choice.
[11/15/17, 8:05:01 AM] <Zismarith> OMG Erika 3 games for you to finish in 2 week winter break!!
[11/15/17, 8:05:12 AM] <stargazer1977> FemShep is definitely Shep, I agree.

[11/15/17, 8:05:37 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Hitman hype!
[11/15/17, 8:05:39 AM] <Zismarith> @xBullish The hosts don't like it, the crew doesn't like it, and the moderators don't like it. Not gonna win that fight.
[11/15/17, 8:05:39 AM] <VividReeder> When is talks on?
[11/15/17, 8:05:46 AM] <Danoba> !whenistm
[11/15/17, 8:05:47 AM] <Nightbot> Talks Machina is on at 7 PM PST, it is currently 4:05 PM PST. There is 2 Hours, 54 Minutes, 14 Seconds until the next episode of Talks Machina. This has command has been run 93 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[11/15/17, 8:05:49 AM] <stargazer1977> I have beaten FFX-2 4 times, yes.
[11/15/17, 8:06:13 AM] <cinphoria> Y'all I just sent a pup tent to G&S for puppies to be in. If you don't use it Sam and I'll be very disappointed
[11/15/17, 8:06:22 AM] <Compel_Bast> hi people
[11/15/17, 8:06:32 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> episodic worked for the game, it can work for tv.
[11/15/17, 8:06:34 AM] <Zismarith> Hey Compel
[11/15/17, 8:06:43 AM] <Compel_Bast> allo
[11/15/17, 8:07:10 AM] <stargazer1977> Battlefield 2 had an... interesting weekend.
[11/15/17, 8:07:13 AM] <GeekTheNoble> what if somepne produces a choose your own adventure tv series based on a game...
[11/15/17, 8:07:24 AM] <FuffyButt> i kind of like the hood
[11/15/17, 8:07:33 AM] <Compel_Bast> I heard something like EA have lost like 5% of their stock price in the last day or so
[11/15/17, 8:07:55 AM] <stargazer1977> You need to grind for about 40 hours each for Vader and Luke. That's an issue.
[11/15/17, 8:07:59 AM] <baxorn> you now have to call a representative if you want a battlefront 2 refund lol
[11/15/17, 8:08:04 AM] <stargazer1977> By average.
[11/15/17, 8:08:09 AM] <Addendums> People need to vote with their wallets. EA continues to be successful despite all of the negative backlash
[11/15/17, 8:08:22 AM] <Zismarith> By a factor of like 12x.
[11/15/17, 8:09:04 AM] <Zismarith> gandsSubHype gandsSubHype
[11/15/17, 8:09:10 AM] <dayntee> Oh, we're talking about EA. D:
[11/15/17, 8:09:22 AM] <stargazer1977> It's not like Vader and Luke are added characters, they are in the promotional materials and trailers.
[11/15/17, 8:09:22 AM] <Danoba> Oh hey @dayntee
[11/15/17, 8:09:32 AM] <dayntee> Oh hey, @Danoba
[11/15/17, 8:09:50 AM] <RiskyPixels> yeah, I figured this would be a topic today :P
[11/15/17, 8:09:58 AM] <Lefty79> Ohai @Danoba !
[11/15/17, 8:10:05 AM] <Danoba> Oh hey @Lefty79
[11/15/17, 8:10:12 AM] <Cerebral_emesis> Hi Shish and Erica! shishWW tinytatoHugs gandsSubHype
[11/15/17, 8:10:12 AM] <sdelcastillo1> EA loves their microtransactions
[11/15/17, 8:10:26 AM] <Zismarith> Yeah, they do . . .
[11/15/17, 8:10:29 AM] <Saraphys> Yes... but they DROPPED the amount of rewards, too!
[11/15/17, 8:10:33 AM] <dayntee> They have dropped the credits required, but I've also understood they dropped the rate of acquisition as well.
[11/15/17, 8:10:35 AM] <Comiccover> another main negative point is they removed the ability to refund your preorder
[11/15/17, 8:10:35 AM] <stargazer1977> That was announced yesterday, but the game officially came out today, so it probably just happened.
[11/15/17, 8:10:39 AM] <LizForkin> Mircotransactions trigger me
[11/15/17, 8:10:40 AM] <RiskyPixels> they have also removed the refund button from their website though...
[11/15/17, 8:10:41 AM] <mixyourfeelings> thats rude
[11/15/17, 8:10:44 AM] <Droid_Sensei> they dropped the amount you earn each match also so effectivly they did nothing
[11/15/17, 8:10:46 AM] <Laboons_beard> They Dropped the Credits it costs but they Also dropped the Reward payout
[11/15/17, 8:10:58 AM] <bunnyhaker> hi
[11/15/17, 8:11:17 AM] <T_K_421> Well, come on, Leia got shot in Star Wars and in Return of the Jedi. 4Head
[11/15/17, 8:11:21 AM] <stargazer1977> @Chix_with_Joystix microtransactions overall don't trigger me, although I find them slightly predatory, but microtransactions in a full priced game REALLY trigger me.
[11/15/17, 8:11:21 AM] <Comiccover> they stopped the ability to refund your preorder because of mass-refunds
[11/15/17, 8:11:21 AM] <omenu> all hero's should be the same price.
[11/15/17, 8:11:33 AM] <MalekBlitz> THEY DIDNT RESPOND ! they lowered REWARDS !!!!
[11/15/17, 8:11:38 AM] <Zismarith> Yes, if your Reddit post is 10x more unpopular than the next most downvoted post and your stock goes down, they'll respond very quickly :)
[11/15/17, 8:11:39 AM] <bunnyhaker> hi
[11/15/17, 8:11:42 AM] <Ezii_SH> at least it doesnt look like trash like....Marvel vs Capcom Infinite
[11/15/17, 8:11:57 AM] <Lone_Hobbit> that is why i avoid multiplayer games
[11/15/17, 8:11:58 AM] <Sapho_Addict> ramaLurk ramaHype
[11/15/17, 8:12:01 AM] <baxorn> @chix_with_joystix did you see how they are able to refund battlefront 2 lol
[11/15/17, 8:12:11 AM] <baxorn> changed*
[11/15/17, 8:12:13 AM] <King_Wataba> especially since the next most downvoted comment was defending hitler
[11/15/17, 8:12:21 AM] <chuckytheclown11> hey guys
[11/15/17, 8:12:30 AM] <Danoba> Hey @chuckytheclown11
[11/15/17, 8:12:37 AM] <dayntee> Who's in Hufflepuff with me?!
[11/15/17, 8:12:49 AM] <LizForkin> I'll still buy the game...I love Star Wars and battlefront too much
[11/15/17, 8:12:58 AM] <AsheHeartthrob> me! i'm a hufflepuff
[11/15/17, 8:13:03 AM] <warrlorrd> yup
[11/15/17, 8:13:03 AM] <cinphoria> love you 'Puffs. You're the softest. gotta go be back soon
[11/15/17, 8:13:03 AM] <VahnQuish> Hufflepufff... FailFish ... Kappa
[11/15/17, 8:13:05 AM] <Therealwyldride> Harimon Go?!?
[11/15/17, 8:13:07 AM] <RuzgofDI> And it's Niantic, so they probably know as much about what they're doing as we do.
[11/15/17, 8:13:08 AM] <cinphoria> ssssssss
[11/15/17, 8:13:09 AM] <RiskyPixels> I want this to be great, but I'm so skeptical after pokemon go
[11/15/17, 8:13:11 AM] <dayntee> Ingress and PokemonGo are basically the same thing. >>
[11/15/17, 8:13:20 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> not me Im a muggle
[11/15/17, 8:13:21 AM] <Compel_Bast> Guys at work were obsessed with Ingress
[11/15/17, 8:13:29 AM] <Saraphys> NO! Not "good on them"... thats not a win, thats a nothing! EA wont change, and will just keep doing this, as long as people keep buying into this method. You have to protest with your wallet, and just NOT buy their, and all other "Games as a Service" games! Period!
[11/15/17, 8:13:41 AM] <sdelcastillo1> Niantic so it will be released only half finished and mostly unplayable?
[11/15/17, 8:13:47 AM] <chuckytheclown11> battlefront 2 is still a great game no one is force u too buy any of the micotrans action stuff in the game
[11/15/17, 8:13:55 AM] <RuzgofDI> @sdelcastillo1 more or less
[11/15/17, 8:13:59 AM] <Addendums> @Zismarith I'm not sure if it is going to hurt them in the grand scheme of things though. These type of responses towards EAs decisions with their games has been going on for awhile, they continue to be successful.
[11/15/17, 8:14:01 AM] <Comiccover> hopefully they transfer the servers
[11/15/17, 8:14:07 AM] <FinFinFoo> lol
[11/15/17, 8:14:25 AM] <Comiccover> I spent so much money that was wasted on crashed games with items used
[11/15/17, 8:14:28 AM] <RuzgofDI> There was a time (the first week)
[11/15/17, 8:14:31 AM] <dayntee> Pokemon Go actually did help me go out and breathe fresh air. That's insane.
[11/15/17, 8:14:33 AM] <RiskyPixels> I also hope they don't just reuse the same landmarks that they used for pokemon :/
[11/15/17, 8:14:36 AM] <LonewolfOfSD> For one month and one month only. lol
[11/15/17, 8:14:36 AM] <Laboons_beard> If you live in a City maybe
[11/15/17, 8:14:53 AM] <Compel_Bast> A lot of the Pokemon Go gym and pokestop locations were based on the data gathered in Ingress I think
[11/15/17, 8:14:54 AM] <Danoba> @dayntee Same, went on longer walks and such too because of it.
[11/15/17, 8:14:56 AM] <dayntee> If I can go wander around my neighborhood wearing a "Pokemon Trainer" tee and get a high five and not a giant wedgie, it's a win.
[11/15/17, 8:15:00 AM] <RiskyPixels> We are all taking about in past tense for a reason though
