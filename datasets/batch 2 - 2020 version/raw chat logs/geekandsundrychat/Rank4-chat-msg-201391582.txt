[11/15/17, 1:17:50 PM] <Therealwyldride> Mr. Frieze: Batman villain who has a very specific design esthetic. I think maybe there's columns involved. I'm not sure. Character still needs work.

[11/15/17, 1:19:49 PM] <ShadracMould> no body sounds like James Earl Jones
[11/15/17, 1:20:08 PM] <Therealwyldride> The key to playing Luke Skywalker is the lightsaber repair. If you can get the lightsaber repair aspect down, you can nail it.
