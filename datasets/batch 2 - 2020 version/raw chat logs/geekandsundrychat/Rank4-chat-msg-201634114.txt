[11/16/17, 11:09:52 AM] <stargazer1977> Yeah, I came to G&S for CR, always been a D&D nerd since the red box in the early 80's. But watched more and more shows on here, and watching it now more than ever because this has been my favorite show lineup since I started watching this channel.

[11/16/17, 11:17:55 AM] <NeverwinterFool> @cinphoria Ah, gotcha. :D
[11/16/17, 11:17:59 AM] <montanabilly> Job Bluth
[11/16/17, 11:18:04 AM] <stargazer1977> Matt is always too pure for this world, in life and in fantasy.
[11/16/17, 11:18:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> "It's pronounced 'joblin'." Somewhere, Matt Mercer just shouted, "I will f**king fight you!"
[11/16/17, 11:18:10 AM] <halfaringcircus> Is that Vision on the blackboard?
[11/16/17, 11:18:12 AM] <ToonEzon> Goblins is a comic?
[11/16/17, 11:18:17 AM] <phoenixgoth> Matt is absolutely too pure
[11/16/17, 11:18:18 AM] <AnActualManitee> Phil is their Kevin bacon
[11/16/17, 11:18:21 AM] <KBTibbs> He's a Nerd Social Nexus
[11/16/17, 11:18:25 AM] <cinphoria> @GInquisitor I just pictured that in my head and It Is Good
[11/16/17, 11:18:28 AM] <talahar> yesterday the indiegogo was at 8%, today it's 18% <-- so awesome!
[11/16/17, 11:18:28 AM] <The_TBoyce> I donated to Goblins Animated: I highly recommend this Indiegogo project!
[11/16/17, 11:18:29 AM] <artistsomeday> adorbs
[11/16/17, 11:18:29 AM] <highvoltage988> Phil LaMarr is literally the center of the geek universe <3
[11/16/17, 11:18:35 AM] <crthemighty> 6 degrees of phil lamar
[11/16/17, 11:18:37 AM] <phoenixgoth> I think that is Vision.
[11/16/17, 11:18:38 AM] <Chovexani> it's a webcomic @ToonEzon
[11/16/17, 11:18:41 AM] <cinphoria> Me too, Phil!
[11/16/17, 11:18:47 AM] <DANfan69> Phil LaMarr has done everything
[11/16/17, 11:18:49 AM] <ToonEzon> ah\
[11/16/17, 11:18:49 AM] <HyperHalfling> woo, thanks, Ginquistador!
[11/16/17, 11:18:52 AM] <artistsomeday> same
[11/16/17, 11:18:54 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> dang me and phil got into comics/reading the same way
[11/16/17, 11:19:03 AM] <harberst> So the geeky version of 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon is 6 degrees of Phil LaMarr?
[11/16/17, 11:19:04 AM] <HyperHalfling> oh, I misspelled you. I apologise
[11/16/17, 11:19:11 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> Wow!
[11/16/17, 11:19:13 AM] <tortugadelmar> I first heard of Phil through MadTV if y'all know what that is
[11/16/17, 11:19:25 AM] <ToonEzon> i'm still having trouble diving into comics, especially considering how deep the dive is
[11/16/17, 11:19:25 AM] <The_TBoyce> Technically, my first comic was Spider-Man, but what really got me into comics was Star Wars. Thanks, Dark Horse! <3
[11/16/17, 11:19:28 AM] <WelshAndyT> mmmmmm Bacon
[11/16/17, 11:19:36 AM] <MeggieMay328> we didn't have the channel at the time but I've heard of MadTV
[11/16/17, 11:19:36 AM] <ToonEzon> i mean that's at least partly why i watch this show
[11/16/17, 11:19:38 AM] <stargazer1977> I first saw him in "Pulp Fiction"... but I'm old, I saw that in theaters, lol.
[11/16/17, 11:19:39 AM] <DANfan69> Phil LaMarr, a former MAD TV Alum collected MAD magazines? Mind Blown
[11/16/17, 11:19:43 AM] <crthemighty> i saw phil on castle back in the day. and then i realized he voices All The Things
[11/16/17, 11:19:44 AM] <Cymmetri> Pulp Fiction, Samaraui Jack, Justice League(s), Static Shock...
[11/16/17, 11:19:48 AM] <highvoltage988> @tortugadelmar same, I was shocked when I learned the UPS guy from MadTV was a voice in Futurama and Justice League
[11/16/17, 11:20:03 AM] <ToonEzon> @tortugadelmar ooh ooh i do i do
[11/16/17, 11:20:03 AM] <Cymmetri> ...Futurama, Spiderman 2...
[11/16/17, 11:20:07 AM] <ToonEzon> lol
[11/16/17, 11:20:10 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> @halfaringcircus No. That's Iron Man on the board I believe
[11/16/17, 11:20:15 AM] <stargazer1977> His role in Pulp Fiction is super iconic, lol. Marvin.
[11/16/17, 11:20:16 AM] <Chovexani> MATT IS BIG EARS YESSSSSS <3 <3 <3
[11/16/17, 11:20:20 AM] <AromiaFlyce> Boom! Backed!
[11/16/17, 11:20:24 AM] <WelshAndyT> Technically my first comic was the Dandy, but that's not a super hero comic, that's a traditional, comic, with a collection of kids cartoons
[11/16/17, 11:20:25 AM] <DANfan69> Phil is also Samurai Jack and Vamp from Metal Gear 2
[11/16/17, 11:20:25 AM] <Chovexani> he's my favorite
[11/16/17, 11:20:29 AM] <ToonEzon> yea i used to watch madTV all the time as a kid
[11/16/17, 11:20:29 AM] <tortugadelmar> @highvoltage988 don't forget samurai jack
[11/16/17, 11:20:30 AM] <japenrose> @highvoltage988 Don't forget Samurai Jack!
[11/16/17, 11:20:41 AM] <misssunflower94> metaphorssss
[11/16/17, 11:20:47 AM] <HyperHalfling> thanks, @aromiaflyce !
[11/16/17, 11:20:55 AM] <DreamingOfAWolf> I'm hoping there might be some cameos from the 'To The Poop' goblins... That would be kinda hilarious!
[11/16/17, 11:20:56 AM] <The_TBoyce> BTW, I just want to say really quickly that it was such a privilege to talk comics with Taliesin at "This Freakin' Circus". A lot of great conversations on everything from the Defenders to female Captain America.
[11/16/17, 11:21:08 AM] <AromiaFlyce> @HyperHalfling I am super excited about it and super happy to support it! <3
[11/16/17, 11:21:10 AM] <stargazer1977> Poor Phil, always has his head blown off by John Travolta.
[11/16/17, 11:21:18 AM] <LegottiWorks> This makes me want a Webcomic Wednesday Club
[11/16/17, 11:21:20 AM] <highvoltage988> I'm gonna be sacreligious here, but I never watched Samurai Jack as a kid *hide*
[11/16/17, 11:21:23 AM] <HyperHalfling> Yay! :D
[11/16/17, 11:21:34 AM] <LegottiWorks> Megas XLR was more fun
[11/16/17, 11:21:38 AM] <cinphoria> OH WOW THAT WAS MATT KEY'S VOICE
[11/16/17, 11:21:40 AM] <Cymmetri> I've refreshed a dozen times! Dangit Twitch!
