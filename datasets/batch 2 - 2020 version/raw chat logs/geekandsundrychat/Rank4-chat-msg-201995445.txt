[11/17/17, 8:02:54 AM] <The_TBoyce> "Lore in Music" is a great topic. I can't help but think of the Chant of Light in "Dragon Age", "The Song of the Dragonborn" in Skyrim, etc.
[11/17/17, 8:03:04 AM] <ElRoboRick> OMG it is @maris_lyn :D
[11/17/17, 8:03:11 AM] <stargazer1977> If you love stories in music, definitely listen to Prog Rock and Prog Metal. Great stories and themes.

[11/17/17, 8:03:23 AM] <The_TBoyce> That's very true: the Odyssey, one of the greatest epic poems, was sung. Same with Beowulf.

[11/17/17, 8:03:35 AM] <GreenishPtero> Glorious hair: the show
[11/17/17, 8:03:43 AM] <The_TBoyce> I wouldn't be surprised if the myth of Gilgamesh had been sung by bards too.

[11/17/17, 8:04:57 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> Oh, please PLEASE talk about The Moldau. One of the best symphonic works that tells a full story without words.
[11/17/17, 8:04:57 AM] <stargazer1977> Gilgamesh was an oral tradition, like most epics. We know for sure that parts of it were sung in both the Sumerian version and in the Babylonian version of the same story. The cuneiform shows parts were set to music.

[11/17/17, 8:06:31 AM] <The_TBoyce> I'm curious how many in-universe songs everyone knows? Anyone know "The Journey Begins" from Ace Combat? "The Dawn Will Come" from Dragon Age?
[11/17/17, 8:06:43 AM] <rasnac_khan> I just tuned in and I see Erika Ishii, so it will be a great day. :)
[11/17/17, 8:07:00 AM] <The_TBoyce> I'm sure everyone already knows "The Rains of Castamere" from Game of Thrones.
[11/17/17, 8:07:02 AM] <ElRoboRick> I love Geoff!
[11/17/17, 8:07:08 AM] <dewvoltage88> when comes to stress and life ive been listening to linkin park and nirvana
[11/17/17, 8:07:20 AM] <chaoticloony> Goregasm is a fabulous name
[11/17/17, 8:07:33 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I... didn't expect a name like that.
[11/17/17, 8:07:37 AM] <EricaTheStrange> DAI ftw that's a great song @GInquisitor

[11/17/17, 8:08:23 AM] <The_TBoyce> I really want to hear that song, Geoff!
[11/17/17, 8:08:26 AM] <WelshAndyT> Have we had enough discussion about how great Erika's jacket is?
[11/17/17, 8:09:18 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> I remember that mini series
[11/17/17, 8:09:45 AM] <The_TBoyce> When we read Beowulf in high school, after we finished the story, we got to watch it performed in song, in the original Old English.
[11/17/17, 8:09:46 AM] <Breeaii> The oneshot is set for 8PM right?

[11/17/17, 8:10:18 AM] <maris_lyn> Hey @Danoba :)
[11/17/17, 8:10:19 AM] <stargazer1977> Wagner was also one of the composers who influenced metal the most.
[11/17/17, 8:10:30 AM] <Danoba> Hey @maris_lyn
[11/17/17, 8:10:41 AM] <The_TBoyce> @MrNY2CALI "Ride of the Valkyries" is some of the most epic questing music. I love when my DM uses it for our games.
[11/17/17, 8:10:51 AM] <stargazer1977> Surprisingly heavy metal is one of the modern music forms that is most inspired by classical composers.
[11/17/17, 8:11:14 AM] <harberst> slightly disappointed they weren't referencing "O Brother Where Art Thou" when they started talking about movies based on "The Odyssey" :P
[11/17/17, 8:11:18 AM] <dewvoltage88> @GeekandSundry for ryan .. me more of the misty mountain cold songs like that .. that are relaxing and calming help me with everything with life or gelet the song from dr. disrespect
[11/17/17, 8:11:28 AM] <chaoticloony> My favorite songs are probably Goblin Gold, 307 Ale, The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, and Roll on Mississippi!
[11/17/17, 8:11:28 AM] <stargazer1977> The Flower Duet is beautiful.
[11/17/17, 8:11:38 AM] <ElRoboRick> @Danoba :D
[11/17/17, 8:11:39 AM] <The_TBoyce> @stargazer1977 Something interesting I found interesting was that quite a few metal bands take their names from Tolkien. For example, "Gorgoroth".
[11/17/17, 8:11:49 AM] <MrNY2Cali> flower duet was a commerical standard for years
[11/17/17, 8:12:11 AM] <The_TBoyce> I know the aria you're talking about, Erika. And actually, you sounded pretty good. You have a good ear for music.
[11/17/17, 8:12:31 AM] <ThatGamerGrl> That's an amazing aria. Really great for testing breath control.
[11/17/17, 8:12:36 AM] <stargazer1977> Amon Amarth is my favorite black metal band, the only band I truly love that growls vocals, and that's a Tolkien name, and they also sing several songs set in Middle Earth. @GInquisitor
[11/17/17, 8:13:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> @stargazer1977 I should check them out, then!
[11/17/17, 8:13:14 AM] <stargazer1977> Iced Earth is great.
