[11/21/17, 8:03:31 AM] <starpilotsix> To create a pumpkin pie from scratch you must first invent the universe.
[11/21/17, 8:03:41 AM] <chaoticloony> @DeLevely So very true!

[11/21/17, 8:04:56 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I strongly favor episodes that aren't annoyingly kid friendly. :D
[11/21/17, 8:04:56 AM] <starpilotsix> It's got fairy tale characters in it, so it must be kid-appropriate, right?

[11/21/17, 8:05:11 AM] <Compel_Bast> So was CR a repeat of the A2M gather your party?
[11/21/17, 8:05:17 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Hello all

[11/21/17, 8:05:32 AM] <chaoticloony> You did really good on Critical Role, Stef!
[11/21/17, 8:05:35 AM] <JJ_Dane> The one shot was cool. Good casting choices all around
[11/21/17, 8:05:36 AM] <djwho> Stef, was that your very first rpg experience, really?

[11/21/17, 8:05:59 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub HYPE!!!
[11/21/17, 8:06:01 AM] <Critternation3000> @stargazer1977 she loved her tiny men
[11/21/17, 8:06:05 AM] <dylandovale> I believe Jeff Goldblum would have given it 10 out of 10 Goldblum's for glitter fabulousness
[11/21/17, 8:06:08 AM] <DeLevely> This is CR, we kill the children and the old people
[11/21/17, 8:06:09 AM] <djwho> Stef stole from the Scarecow's stomach.
[11/21/17, 8:06:12 AM] <Compel_Bast> Gina's right, it's important to clarify these things when both D&D, or Stef is involved
[11/21/17, 8:06:13 AM] <djwho> @Zismarith Thanks
[11/21/17, 8:06:14 AM] <stargazer1977> And I loved her for it.
[11/21/17, 8:06:17 AM] <Losile> Tinym'n!
[11/21/17, 8:06:28 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Its not a critrole episode unless a child is killed
[11/21/17, 8:06:30 AM] <stargazer1977> Bonnie's chest.
[11/21/17, 8:06:52 AM] <DeLevely> "I had a large canvas" diplomatic af

[11/21/17, 8:07:34 AM] <Ozai75> That's because Stef's a robot, Amy. You should know that by now. :D
[11/21/17, 8:07:35 AM] <Critternation3000> LUL that stomach theft was the best part
[11/21/17, 8:07:36 AM] <djwho> It was hilarious
[11/21/17, 8:07:36 AM] <DeLevely> MnC has the very best "What I've done this week" report EVER! <3
[11/21/17, 8:07:40 AM] <TheraExplorer> It was amazing
[11/21/17, 8:07:41 AM] <Highfarm73> Stef did a reverse chestburster on a poor scarecrow :D
[11/21/17, 8:07:43 AM] <Compel_Bast> Stef's brain: "And this is when I sound like a lunatic."
[11/21/17, 8:07:48 AM] <stargazer1977> He did offer that she go through the other orifice, then she shocked him, so they thought. Normal DnD.

[11/21/17, 8:11:04 AM] <Leigh574> hello everyone <3
[11/21/17, 8:11:05 AM] <DeLevely> Gina is excited! <3

[11/21/17, 8:11:44 AM] <JJ_Dane> Maybe slightly less determination now, all things considered...?
[11/21/17, 8:11:47 AM] <JeffM0307> DETERMINATION!
[11/21/17, 8:11:48 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> macarons are overrated though
[11/21/17, 8:11:51 AM] <djwho> @Shadowstorm_ Undertaile reference
[11/21/17, 8:12:00 AM] <DanManMtn> lol
[11/21/17, 8:12:04 AM] <stargazer1977> Macarons are underrated.
[11/21/17, 8:12:06 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Gina has all the excitement
[11/21/17, 8:12:07 AM] <TheraExplorer> lol Gina's eyes
[11/21/17, 8:12:14 AM] <chaoticloony> I am loving this already!
[11/21/17, 8:12:15 AM] <djwho> Are macarons sweet or savory? Or both?
[11/21/17, 8:12:17 AM] <JeffM0307> Poor blurred-out-face guy
[11/21/17, 8:12:25 AM] <Ozai75> Sweet
[11/21/17, 8:12:25 AM] <bluelinnet> gandsLessthanthree
[11/21/17, 8:12:26 AM] <meaningofnightt> I need like 900 hours of this
[11/21/17, 8:12:28 AM] <DeLevely> Amy's face is always all of us always?
[11/21/17, 8:12:29 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> @Jzalias Lol i know the question mark was accidental haha
[11/21/17, 8:12:30 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Back room? Don't you mean Macron?
[11/21/17, 8:12:39 AM] <FuffyButt> nitro? does drinking that turn you into a bomb? is gina going to explode
[11/21/17, 8:12:42 AM] <Ozai75> and @stargazer1977 you're a blashphemer! :p
[11/21/17, 8:12:42 AM] <DeLevely> Amy is also excited! I am pleased by all the excitement
[11/21/17, 8:12:45 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Terrible...ha ha
[11/21/17, 8:12:46 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> did you see Stef's face in response to that cat plushie
[11/21/17, 8:12:47 AM] <JeffM0307> LOL
[11/21/17, 8:12:54 AM] <stargazer1977> They are sweet, but come in hundreds of different flavors. Some can be a bit salty, if you choose to flavor them that way. But they aren't really savory. Just not overly sweet.
[11/21/17, 8:12:55 AM] <Graydonsmith> this should be a weekly series
[11/21/17, 8:12:59 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> This place is so cute???!!!!
[11/21/17, 8:12:59 AM] <Ozai75> oh my god look at those!
[11/21/17, 8:13:06 AM] <djwho> Well, however it's spelled. I don't like sweets or salty
[11/21/17, 8:13:10 AM] <davidflegel> @JeffM0307 the blurred out guy was probably once Stef's boyfriend. I don't feel bad for him at all
[11/21/17, 8:13:14 AM] <DeLevely> Stef really nailing documentary style for her debut—props!
[11/21/17, 8:13:18 AM] <DanManMtn> we need square Minecraft Macarons!
[11/21/17, 8:13:31 AM] <djwho> This is really good
[11/21/17, 8:13:42 AM] <JeffM0307> @davidflegel Neither do I
[11/21/17, 8:13:48 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> cubed macrons
[11/21/17, 8:14:00 AM] <Ahbrando> What's the craft tonight
[11/21/17, 8:14:00 AM] <Critternation3000> @davidflegel he's probably in Seattle now tho
[11/21/17, 8:14:04 AM] <bluelinnet> chemistry + art should be right in the G&S wheelhouse
[11/21/17, 8:14:12 AM] <Danoba> I really wish I had decided to order macarons for today.
[11/21/17, 8:14:16 AM] <Penumant> Imagine if this was a horror movie
[11/21/17, 8:14:17 AM] <davidflegel> @Critternation3000 It would be worth it
[11/21/17, 8:14:19 AM] <DeLevely> @Danoba +1, ngl
[11/21/17, 8:14:22 AM] <stargazer1977> You need really fine almond flower for them.
[11/21/17, 8:14:28 AM] <stargazer1977> Not just regular store bought.
[11/21/17, 8:14:31 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Ive never actually eaten macarons
[11/21/17, 8:14:37 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> many people added art to STEM to make STEAM
[11/21/17, 8:14:38 AM] <Rocketsoup> I don't understand. That's not a crafting bench.
[11/21/17, 8:14:44 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> me neither
[11/21/17, 8:14:45 AM] <bluelinnet> i have cinnamon pumpkin macarons, but i'd have to walk to the kitchen to get them

[11/21/17, 8:14:58 AM] <DeLevely> I think the last time I had them was with Jody at SDCC, which I guess is also macaron+nerdiness?
[11/21/17, 8:14:59 AM] <meaningofnightt> I had one really nasty experience with one and havent had any sense
[11/21/17, 8:14:59 AM] <DanManMtn> can i lick the bowl?
[11/21/17, 8:15:02 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> This is going to go all Sweeney Todd at the end, right?

[11/21/17, 8:15:09 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> kind of reminds me of watching "How It's Made" but with more dramatic music
[11/21/17, 8:15:10 AM] <stargazer1977> The music in this is hilarious.
