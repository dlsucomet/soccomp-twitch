[11/22/17, 8:04:13 AM] <Zismarith> He's the best at what he does. And what he does is pretty sweeeeeeet.
[11/22/17, 8:04:22 AM] <WelshAndyT> you didn't call him your precious
[11/22/17, 8:04:40 AM] <LizForkin> Andy Serkis was simply amazing and I'm amazed I didn't turn into a puddle when we met him

[11/22/17, 8:06:32 AM] <ItsPandarr> don't tell people Animal Crossing is out until the end of the show... now half the people are leaving to play it!
[11/22/17, 8:06:36 AM] <Mama_Succubus> Where the sword. Shwing
[11/22/17, 8:07:06 AM] <ItsPandarr> she was friends with everybody in Animal Crossing, but nobody in the dorm. :(
[11/22/17, 8:07:19 AM] <Ghost_of_Dividion> i have like a years worth of crit role to watch almost...fuuuuuuu
[11/22/17, 8:08:01 AM] <Critternation3000> @ghost_of_dividion there's always the podcast
[11/22/17, 8:08:15 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Ghost_of_Dividion if you are watching on the youtube channel, don't forget you can watch at 1.5x speed or faster
[11/22/17, 8:08:15 AM] <Marb_04> VC is one of my favorite games
[11/22/17, 8:08:49 AM] <WelshAndyT> Federation vs Imperial forces, so Star Trek meets Star Wars lol
[11/22/17, 8:09:16 AM] <Zismarith> I love SRPGS! I'm just really, really awful at them.
[11/22/17, 8:09:23 AM] <BillyKidd007> what are they playing as on crit role this week?
[11/22/17, 8:09:33 AM] <BlackwaterXe_> what game was that? it looked like valkyria chronicles
[11/22/17, 8:09:53 AM] <Wraithe42> Who needed sleep anyhow?
[11/22/17, 8:09:53 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm with Trish, I love turn based SRPGs. I'm good at them, but that's not why I love them. The Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics series are my favorites, but Disgaea is up there as well.
[11/22/17, 8:09:54 AM] <ItsPandarr> can you date the tanks?
[11/22/17, 8:10:06 AM] <stargazer1977> It's Valkyria Chronicles 4.
[11/22/17, 8:10:06 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @BillyKidd007 they are probably playing as Thanksgiving revelers as there will be no Crit Role this week
[11/22/17, 8:10:14 AM] <Lacedmushroom> Its a really hard game. I love them
[11/22/17, 8:10:17 AM] <BillyKidd007> but aren't they in hollywood, where everybody hates thanksgiving and wants it to be indigenous peoples day?
[11/22/17, 8:10:23 AM] <JitzB0mb> Oh my gawd it's Trisha Hersberger
[11/22/17, 8:10:30 AM] <BlvckYaksha> cmonBruh cmonBruh
[11/22/17, 8:10:49 AM] <stargazer1977> They are still going to spend time with their family, whether you celebrate Thanksgiving or not.
[11/22/17, 8:10:52 AM] <Compel_Bast> Think X-Com's revival has helped with this?
[11/22/17, 8:10:57 AM] <Marb_04> edelweiss is super hot
[11/22/17, 8:10:59 AM] <boone_faustus> Turn based rpgs will always be the best.
[11/22/17, 8:11:32 AM] <CPfalken> M&B banner lord has to be good or i'm fucking ending it
[11/22/17, 8:11:36 AM] <Compel_Bast> Oh man, I loved Mount & Blade but I was so, so, so, sooooo awful at the combat
[11/22/17, 8:11:37 AM] <stargazer1977> X-Com is not that similar, and they are Japanese developers, I seriously doubt it moved the needle on the decision at all.
[11/22/17, 8:12:02 AM] <Danoba> @Compel_Bast Always been a big fan of the series as well. Interesting to see where it goes.
[11/22/17, 8:12:05 AM] <YapperGodschild> thats bullcrap
[11/22/17, 8:12:43 AM] <civicpride> sometimes you just wanna play a beat em up
