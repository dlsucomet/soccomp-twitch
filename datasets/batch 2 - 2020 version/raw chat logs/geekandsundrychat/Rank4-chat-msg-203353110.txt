[11/22/17, 11:04:38 AM] <AuroraeEagle> @BladeEdge93 @Miltonite It's a d20 based system, which only uses d20 within the game. It's roll above, where the GM sets a target number, and the player can spend points to decrease by increments of 3.
[11/22/17, 11:04:39 AM] <eolhterr0r> GMs don't roll dice!

[11/22/17, 11:11:30 AM] <ThreeRaccoonsInACoat> @avidwanderer_ But the technology involved can do some very, very 'magical' things.
[11/22/17, 11:11:40 AM] <taliahklei> wouldn't know. im on my THIRD ad!
[11/22/17, 11:11:54 AM] <artistsomeday> I like that the social media guy is so soft spoken. Like he would never use the cap lock. :D
