[11/28/17, 8:02:44 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Did Curie screw up the time continuum or something?
[11/28/17, 8:02:45 AM] <teh_spikey> Amy is right
[11/28/17, 8:02:45 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Chiving_On_KCCO
[11/28/17, 8:02:47 AM] <eTron000> That's Go!
[11/28/17, 8:02:48 AM] <postdataest> cheer1000 Viking bits!
[11/28/17, 8:02:50 AM] <TheDiMono> Go is the game with black and white stones where you need to close in areas in order to score
[11/28/17, 8:02:52 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub HYPE!!!
[11/28/17, 8:02:54 AM] <starpilotsix> You're thinking of Monopoly.
[11/28/17, 8:02:56 AM] <FuffyButt> black and white stones
[11/28/17, 8:03:02 AM] <starpilotsix> Monopoly is the game you're describing.
[11/28/17, 8:03:03 AM] <zathyr> It's different from othello, but sort of similar
[11/28/17, 8:03:04 AM] <yodastien> Go is a little more complex than othello
[11/28/17, 8:03:05 AM] <djwho> I will be there!
[11/28/17, 8:03:06 AM] <bloody_albatross> go is much harder than chess and only recently the first program managed to beat a go master

[11/28/17, 8:03:16 AM] <harberst> My understanding is it's a bit like chinese checkers mixed with chess. But I could be way off.
[11/28/17, 8:03:16 AM] <chiplickin> I don't know either, so....
[11/28/17, 8:03:20 AM] <Critternation3000> WHAT WHAT WHAT

[11/28/17, 8:03:31 AM] <bloodscribs> Japanese strategy game where you make zones with black or white stones to capture your opponents stones
[11/28/17, 8:03:46 AM] <harberst> Hey @chiplickin
[11/28/17, 8:03:50 AM] <lark7911> !!!
[11/28/17, 8:03:52 AM] <Zismarith> The pillow, while colorful, looks like it might be bad for the digestive tract.
[11/28/17, 8:03:58 AM] <ppson10> mind sweep?
[11/28/17, 8:04:04 AM] <djwho> Thank you for stopping by Heather.
[11/28/17, 8:04:12 AM] <stargazer1977> Mathematicians have long been fascinated with Go.
[11/28/17, 8:04:15 AM] <WelshAndyT> This isn't a phrase that gets used often, but "Amy was right", so remember this day
[11/28/17, 8:04:23 AM] <JeffM0307> Kiseido?
[11/28/17, 8:04:24 AM] <zathyr> Hey I had a dream a couple of weeks ago where I was snacking on pillows. Weird thing is, when I woke up all my marshmallows were gone.
[11/28/17, 8:04:26 AM] <JJ_Dane> Nice seque
[11/28/17, 8:04:29 AM] <chiplickin> @stargazer1977 hey there!
[11/28/17, 8:04:32 AM] <djwho> How was your ladies Thanksiving!
[11/28/17, 8:04:40 AM] <stargazer1977> Hello.
[11/28/17, 8:04:42 AM] <VahnQuish> holy mods batman! I saw @Danoba on the stream and now he's in the chat! :o VaultBoy
[11/28/17, 8:04:43 AM] <harberst> Don't eat the pillow, Amy!
[11/28/17, 8:04:51 AM] <chaoticloony> The original Godfather board game was like that!
[11/28/17, 8:04:53 AM] <djwho> And Gina, why are you the best? LOL
[11/28/17, 8:05:06 AM] <bloody_albatross> pizza pillow?
[11/28/17, 8:05:07 AM] <Danoba> @VahnQuish Haha, yup.
[11/28/17, 8:05:07 AM] <starpilotsix> I believe another name for Othello is Reversi in some places.
[11/28/17, 8:05:07 AM] <EricaTheStrange> soft food?
[11/28/17, 8:05:08 AM] <Zismarith> Medically speaking, I cannot recommend the consumption of pillows created by whimsical gods.
[11/28/17, 8:05:12 AM] <bloody_albatross> ah thats a pie
[11/28/17, 8:05:13 AM] <FuffyButt> i had stones, took a while but they eventually passed
[11/28/17, 8:05:16 AM] <Rogue_13> heh, if only Lady Gaga had known you a few years ago Gina
[11/28/17, 8:05:16 AM] <Saraphys> Hi Doctor and Chief! You're all awesome! :)
[11/28/17, 8:05:17 AM] <djwho> Heather, please guest on SOT?
[11/28/17, 8:05:23 AM] <chaoticloony> Gina and "Butt Pies"?
[11/28/17, 8:05:24 AM] <VahnQuish> you ever go to eat those by accident Gina?
[11/28/17, 8:05:25 AM] <teh_spikey> Go was in the cultural zeitgeist for a while about a year or two ago. Google made an AI to play it and there was a big competition or something where it went up against the best players
[11/28/17, 8:05:41 AM] <minimarker> Totally works
[11/28/17, 8:05:45 AM] <JJ_Dane> Soup pillows ftw
[11/28/17, 8:05:52 AM] <teh_spikey> I didn't follow it but my wife is a googler so she was following it
[11/28/17, 8:05:53 AM] <VahnQuish> who would Heather be on SOT though?
[11/28/17, 8:05:56 AM] <harberst> Pancake earmuffs
[11/28/17, 8:06:01 AM] <JeffM0307> Pancake Princess Leia!
[11/28/17, 8:06:05 AM] <WelshAndyT> The trail of thought was "Gina was eating pop tarts while making things, she put 2 and 2 together and came up with Craft fun fun times"
[11/28/17, 8:06:06 AM] <lookatmetoyadee> hmmm
[11/28/17, 8:06:13 AM] <chiplickin> @zismarith lol PogChamp
[11/28/17, 8:06:17 AM] <EricaTheStrange> her awesome self @VahnQuish
[11/28/17, 8:06:19 AM] <djwho> Amy, how much do you love your gloves? Glove kniuckles?
[11/28/17, 8:06:20 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub HYPE!!!
[11/28/17, 8:06:24 AM] <Zismarith> If she can play a Viking, she can play a Klingon.
[11/28/17, 8:06:38 AM] <stargazer1977> @teh_spikey the Darren Aranofsky movie, "Pi" got me into it about 20 years ago.

[11/28/17, 8:07:03 AM] <djwho> And Amy, so looking forward to seeing you on Sirens of Rea;lm. Everyoyone watch the glorious Amy Dallen.

[11/28/17, 8:07:49 AM] <djwho> Sirens, Amy, get Jodi. So many talented people
[11/28/17, 8:07:54 AM] <WelshAndyT> I'm sorry is Amy going to be using hot glue?, wasn't there an intervention about this?
[11/28/17, 8:08:12 AM] <teh_spikey> @stargazer1977 Oh cool. Yeah I hadn't heard about it before and probably still wouldn't have if my wife wasn't watching the streams of the AI games
[11/28/17, 8:08:43 AM] <harberst> In the words of Mercer, "You can try"
[11/28/17, 8:08:46 AM] <chaoticloony> Re Sub HYPE!!!
[11/28/17, 8:08:55 AM] <ThatCallisto> iâ€™m just imagining the characters from future girl doing arts and crafts now
[11/28/17, 8:09:01 AM] <talahar> I watched some older TV show today: drive with nathan fillion, and lo and behold, there was an Amy Dallen in it, for about five seconds.
[11/28/17, 8:09:02 AM] <WelshAndyT> pre glue is a real issue
[11/28/17, 8:09:07 AM] <teh_spikey> @stargazer1977 I thought it was a large version of Reversi at first and wondered why they bothered lol
[11/28/17, 8:09:09 AM] <minimarker> The hot glue gun is just trying to be helpful.
[11/28/17, 8:09:09 AM] <meaningofnightt> I like how Gina doesnâ€™t exactly say no to Amy
[11/28/17, 8:09:10 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Do we have a first aid kit on standby
[11/28/17, 8:09:23 AM] <Zismarith> 2.
[11/28/17, 8:09:35 AM] <djwho> Thank you you all for sharing your genius.
[11/28/17, 8:09:36 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehehheheh, you ladies are so fabulous!
[11/28/17, 8:09:36 AM] <FuffyButt> viking bits cereal
[11/28/17, 8:09:37 AM] <VahnQuish> Gina hurts every time she has to deny Amy :(
[11/28/17, 8:09:41 AM] <stargazer1977> @teh_spikey yeah, definitely a lot more complex than that.
[11/28/17, 8:09:54 AM] <Critternation3000> Vikings bits HSWP
[11/28/17, 8:10:10 AM] <harberst> To be fair, who wouldn't find it painful to say no to Amy?
[11/28/17, 8:10:18 AM] <FuffyButt> viking bits cereal with real marshmallow axes and severed heads
[11/28/17, 8:10:22 AM] <WelshAndyT> Heather that was a lovely Drunken Australian, English, Irish, American, Alien accent
[11/28/17, 8:10:23 AM] <chaoticloony> @meaningofnightt After seeing Amy chase after people with an ax, i wouldn't say no to Amy either!
[11/28/17, 8:10:27 AM] <djwho> How was your holidays/
[11/28/17, 8:10:27 AM] <VahnQuish> indeed
[11/28/17, 8:10:28 AM] <teh_spikey> @stargazer1977 Yes I quickly realised that lol
[11/28/17, 8:10:58 AM] <djwho> Some of my favorite ladies.
[11/28/17, 8:11:16 AM] <chaoticloony> I love that this show turns adults into children!
[11/28/17, 8:11:31 AM] <chiplickin> @chaoticloony *nods*
[11/28/17, 8:11:34 AM] <WelshAndyT> Gina is just a good mom,keeping an eye on the kids playing with pointy things
[11/28/17, 8:11:35 AM] <minimarker> It's the CIRCLE OF LIFE!!!
[11/28/17, 8:11:38 AM] <JeffM0307> The Pop-tart of life
[11/28/17, 8:12:02 AM] <chiplickin> Come back from an ad, get Lion King #seemslegit
[11/28/17, 8:12:23 AM] <djwho> Cinnamon is the only pop tart I like.
[11/28/17, 8:12:23 AM] <Highfarm73> poptarts is not a thing here
[11/28/17, 8:12:32 AM] <jpcguy89> Brown Sugar and Strawberry. I'm OG.
[11/28/17, 8:12:33 AM] <Starblaiz> You're a wizard, Simba! =^.^=
[11/28/17, 8:12:34 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> They were definitely a rarity in my home. And we only had strawberry cause my siblings hated chocolate like losers
[11/28/17, 8:12:36 AM] <FuffyButt> smores pop tarts
[11/28/17, 8:12:39 AM] <teh_spikey> Gina, you could make a chocolate and peanut butter one with the paler brown as frosting
[11/28/17, 8:12:39 AM] <jpcguy89> OMG. gandsLessthanthree
[11/28/17, 8:12:43 AM] <talahar> i haven't had pop-tarts yet.
[11/28/17, 8:12:44 AM] <jpcguy89> We're so similar
[11/28/17, 8:12:48 AM] <stargazer1977> If I was Amy and Gina, I would have a difficult time even concentrating on crafting while waiting to get back into Shield of Tomorrow to pick up that story arc. I would have been obsessed thinking about it all week. I'm not good at waiting on my D&D games to continue, especially after a cliff hanger.
[11/28/17, 8:12:50 AM] <chaoticloony> Apple Pop Tarts are the best with blueberry and chocolate coming in 2nd!
[11/28/17, 8:13:02 AM] <chiplickin> Wildberry!
