[11/29/17, 8:15:08 AM] <hubbs40> im waiting for TellTales : Tales from the Beccaland with Oshibots
[11/29/17, 8:15:14 AM] <xenonde> the only reason that EA is the worst american publisher is that Ubisoft is french
[11/29/17, 8:15:40 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Dogs having toy controllers might backfire, it could encourage them the real controllers are chew toys... despite chew toy controllers sound adorable.
[11/29/17, 8:15:58 AM] <talahar> problem with hype is when the game doesn't deliver
[11/29/17, 8:15:59 AM] <MrNY2Cali> sometimes they do release & hype at same time if there was already E3, PAX or other gameshow hype already

[11/29/17, 8:18:11 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Taking a gamer to court is some REALLY terrible behavior by a game company.
[11/29/17, 8:18:24 AM] <MrNY2Cali> And this is why as a PS4 user we can't get cross-platform gameplay with our PC friends
[11/29/17, 8:18:31 AM] <CharlotteOfHall> I can‚Äôt even think that far ahead, I‚Äôm still trying to save up for horizon :p
