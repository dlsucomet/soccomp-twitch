[11/30/17, 11:02:17 AM] <stargazer1977> This topic is the least interesting to me since I don't have kids (or grandkids, at my age). But even if I did I would let them read any comic book and just answer any questions they had about things they didn't understand. I would probably make a bad parent, lol.
[11/30/17, 11:02:19 AM] <misssunflower94> hi y'all!

[11/30/17, 11:04:44 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> Yeah 'The Pull' was gone before DC 'Rebirth' happened so Ashley couldn't have been on for that topic :(
[11/30/17, 11:04:45 AM] <halfaringcircus> Then they get into the Terry Moore and Joss Whedon stuff. Losers.
[11/30/17, 11:04:45 AM] <Deacontaylor> runaways.. soo good. the first episode almost mirrored the first original issue. only read the first issue of the new run
[11/30/17, 11:04:46 AM] <angry_ace> Real impressed with Runaways TV show, adding depth to the Pride.

[11/30/17, 11:05:22 AM] <chaoticloony> QUESTION: Amy did you meet Squirrel Girl?
[11/30/17, 11:05:24 AM] <Fatty_Melt> omg BONE is on the table! :D
[11/30/17, 11:05:24 AM] <RonTheRBDM> OMG Amy is wearing a Squirrel Girl shirt and Milana Vayntrub was on Game the Game earlier! Did Amy and Milana meet and did the universe explode with all the awesomeness?

[11/30/17, 11:05:56 AM] <stargazer1977> I have that copy of Bone, have to be careful with it because there are way too many pages for it's binding.

[11/30/17, 11:06:21 AM] <Capefoxalix> I realised recently that segue is not spelled as 'segway' . It was very awkward >.>
[11/30/17, 11:06:21 AM] <sebulasenathun> I like you chief.
[11/30/17, 11:06:25 AM] <japenrose> @Danoba Definitely interesting and lively with my cousins, but fun nonetheless. Glad you got to relax! You all work so hard!
[11/30/17, 11:06:26 AM] <RMutt1917> @chaoticloony between the two of us, we will get an answer
[11/30/17, 11:06:27 AM] <misssunflower94> I love you chief
[11/30/17, 11:06:43 AM] <mathemagician_> @Capefoxalix what it's not...
[11/30/17, 11:06:50 AM] <RonTheRBDM> I loaned out my copy of Bone to a friend and never got it back and I'm so sad... I need to rebuy it
[11/30/17, 11:06:54 AM] <halfaringcircus> Legit, Runaways brought me back to American comics after years away. The library had it over with the manga.
[11/30/17, 11:06:58 AM] <misssunflower94> are those pillow poptarts behind amy and matt
[11/30/17, 11:07:01 AM] <chaoticloony> @RMutt1917 Damn right, inquiring minds want to know!
[11/30/17, 11:07:05 AM] <stargazer1977> I just wish I could have seen Matt watch the Infinity War trailer for the first time. Seeing him react to Dr Strange.

[11/30/17, 11:07:19 AM] <japenrose> Cool!
[11/30/17, 11:07:21 AM] <TheTimkins> Someone bring up Power Pack. The original run was genuinely wonderful. And it's more relevant than almost everything else they're probably talking about.
[11/30/17, 11:07:24 AM] <JeffM0307> YEAHHHHH!
[11/30/17, 11:07:24 AM] <stargazer1977> @misssunflower94 yes, they made them on Mines & Crafts Monday.

[11/30/17, 11:07:59 AM] <RMutt1917> The next MnC, they should make those pillows into Nyan Cat Kappa
[11/30/17, 11:08:01 AM] <misssunflower94> I like that they say 'all ages' and not just 'for kids'
[11/30/17, 11:08:06 AM] <lixyewup> I can't relate to those pillows. I only eat unfrosted Poptarts.
[11/30/17, 11:08:12 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> Oh my gods Chief! You're right! That's way too much time Matt took to mention Doctor Strange tonight! It should've happened sooner...My heart is broken :(

[11/30/17, 11:10:42 AM] <japenrose> @ArKhanAztronn That sounds terrifying
[11/30/17, 11:10:43 AM] <stargazer1977> I only had limited experience with YA books. I was reading Shakespeare and Philip K Dick and such in 5th grade. So I just migrated over to the Adult library before I reached Middle School age. Also, back in the late 80's YA wasn't as big of a thing.
[11/30/17, 11:10:55 AM] <AromiaFlyce> i loved that series. I had every one. I cried so hard reading that
[11/30/17, 11:10:55 AM] <Cymmetri> So TORN. 3 streams I want to watch going on at once
[11/30/17, 11:10:58 AM] <Naialana> @meaningofnightt I owned every book of hers at one point, the best
[11/30/17, 11:11:00 AM] <JeffM0307> There was also a late '80s version
[11/30/17, 11:11:06 AM] <lixyewup> I dunno man. I read Cujo in middle school. That make sit YA?
[11/30/17, 11:11:06 AM] <Capefoxalix> I still have my animorph books, I cant get rid of them
[11/30/17, 11:11:06 AM] <japenrose> Will do!
[11/30/17, 11:11:09 AM] <BoardtoSeth87> I grew up on Don Delillo and Cormac McCarthy. No I didn't. That's a lie. Forgive me.
[11/30/17, 11:11:11 AM] <Anachrontopian> right? Sally Fields on Fire!
[11/30/17, 11:11:17 AM] <japenrose> I saw it advertised somewhere and it looked cool
