[12/1/17, 8:07:10 AM] <Sylien_> Hello people!
[12/1/17, 8:07:11 AM] <Injekce> why all of this for few viewers
[12/1/17, 8:07:22 AM] <Shadowner> its IVAN and RYAN yay
[12/1/17, 8:07:25 AM] <harberst> All of what?
[12/1/17, 8:07:26 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @ImSylien
[12/1/17, 8:07:27 AM] <BillyKidd007> to get to the other side
[12/1/17, 8:07:38 AM] <JJ_Dane> Because the few viewers love it
[12/1/17, 8:07:51 AM] <stargazer1977> This channel was really good when I started watching Critical Role here. But this channel has gotten amazing. I literally love and watch this channel more than I do any TV channel or even Netflix.
[12/1/17, 8:08:02 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[12/1/17, 8:08:22 AM] <chaoticloony> @stargazer1977 Same here
[12/1/17, 8:08:23 AM] <vassagovine> all ze subs
[12/1/17, 8:09:24 AM] <BillyKidd007> lies. My SPECIAL has 6 luck
[12/1/17, 8:09:24 AM] <Shadowner> experience is great for someone troubleshooting tech problems though
[12/1/17, 8:09:27 AM] <harberst> Or as the saying goes "Luck is when hard work and opportunity intersect"
[12/1/17, 8:09:28 AM] <GreenishPtero> Well, you now have SOME hosting experience Ryan
[12/1/17, 8:09:56 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype
[12/1/17, 8:10:01 AM] <vassagovine> Ryan is a natural ðŸ‘Œ
[12/1/17, 8:10:06 AM] <wizardsquestion> Experience seems to out weigh education these days
[12/1/17, 8:10:12 AM] <stargazer1977> Well there are also negative circumstances that will reduce your opportunities, particularly for some people who are not afforded quite so many opportunities due to several social or economic circumstances. So that is still not luck, but it swings in both directions.
[12/1/17, 8:10:18 AM] <FenrirExcalibur> critical role tonight right
[12/1/17, 8:10:28 AM] <GreenishPtero> yep
[12/1/17, 8:10:38 AM] <wizardsquestion> yes @demonhoundwolf
[12/1/17, 8:10:40 AM] <vassagovine> 3 hrs-ish, demon
[12/1/17, 8:10:43 AM] <FenrirExcalibur> Time
[12/1/17, 8:10:59 AM] <perturbulance> marketing is easy, you have product, just increase market by new media ie tv sets
[12/1/17, 8:11:15 AM] <Shadowner> ...like a production manager?
[12/1/17, 8:11:23 AM] <Aureha> 2 hours and 48 minutes. I don't have the countdown open, no, lol
[12/1/17, 8:11:27 AM] <perturbulance> 30k people cared, just get twitch on tv like netflicks
[12/1/17, 8:11:42 AM] <BillyKidd007> Thanks for bringing up marketing, I forgot to grab a gallon of orange juice
[12/1/17, 8:12:07 AM] <stargazer1977> A lot of people already watch Twitch on their TV, through modern consoles.
[12/1/17, 8:12:39 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Diet Coke is better :D
[12/1/17, 8:12:42 AM] <perturbulance> well when i turn on my tv it does not have twitch as an option, don't know what you watch
[12/1/17, 8:12:42 AM] <harberst> -cough product placement cough-
[12/1/17, 8:12:44 AM] <vassagovine> <== Xbox one watcher
[12/1/17, 8:12:45 AM] <BillyKidd007> Studies show coke is preferred more by conservatives and pepsi to liberals
[12/1/17, 8:12:56 AM] <Shadowner> the GNS community were drawn in for a variety of reasons
[12/1/17, 8:13:18 AM] <Daameer> it's why every time it's near december i want to drink cola
[12/1/17, 8:13:20 AM] <stargazer1977> My PlayStation 4 has Twitch and my TV also has Twitch as an app directly on it.
[12/1/17, 8:13:26 AM] <Shadowner> red & white like The original logo
[12/1/17, 8:13:39 AM] <Tellowyn> Diamonds as engagement rings is another example of good marketing
[12/1/17, 8:13:55 AM] <harberst> @rodc06 Most modern game consoles have internet connection which allows the twitch app to run on your tv. Or there's streaming boxes/smart tvs.
[12/1/17, 8:13:56 AM] <GreenishPtero> ryan looks so happy to hear this lol
[12/1/17, 8:13:57 AM] <perturbulance> get away from the lefty liberal stance and fucous on bums on seats, new markets
[12/1/17, 8:14:05 AM] <Splattercatt> I'm watching on PC, but my PC is hooked up to a 60" screen. :P
[12/1/17, 8:14:13 AM] <perturbulance> nice first step done
[12/1/17, 8:14:16 AM] <super390> @Daameer Otherwise winter would be Coke's slow season. So they doubled down on getting you to think of them when you weren't actually hot or thristy.
[12/1/17, 8:14:16 AM] <AwesomeStump> look at freakin apple
[12/1/17, 8:14:31 AM] <vassagovine> Lobsters used to be relegated to convict food
[12/1/17, 8:14:36 AM] <sar_casm> Or use a raspi and connect it to your tv
[12/1/17, 8:14:54 AM] <Daameer> super390 but i don't drink it in other periods of the year... damn marketing and food/gifts and cola... every freaking year
[12/1/17, 8:14:59 AM] <Daameer> yeah ryan just said it
