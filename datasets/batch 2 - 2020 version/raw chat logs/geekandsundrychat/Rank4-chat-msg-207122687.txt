[12/6/17, 8:04:38 AM] <Paladin356> wait...no one liked Justin Bailey?!
[12/6/17, 8:04:42 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I liked that code, @GeekandSundry Erika
[12/6/17, 8:04:53 AM] <Paladin356> Justin Bailey ------ ------
[12/6/17, 8:05:36 AM] <Paladin356> i liked it too...but i didn't know about the code
[12/6/17, 8:05:39 AM] <vanwagoner> what's with your camera? It's not 1080p. Get a damn new camera. You guys are rich enough, for god's sake!
[12/6/17, 8:05:54 AM] <Paladin356> gandsGandsModAlert
[12/6/17, 8:06:09 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I feel weird about choosing favorites, lol. @GeekandSundry
[12/6/17, 8:06:10 AM] <stiffcamel> I like the money cheat in gta
[12/6/17, 8:06:10 AM] <Gkgamerfan> ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA
[12/6/17, 8:06:11 AM] <steelneko> The classic code's gotta win.
[12/6/17, 8:06:25 AM] <Biohybrid> I must be a cruddy nerd. I can't exactly remember the whole code. I keep forgetting it
[12/6/17, 8:06:36 AM] <Paladin356> just...dont use the Konami Code in Gradius 3, cause it'll cause your ship to explode
[12/6/17, 8:06:38 AM] <Zismarith> I'm getting 1080. Not that it matters. And they're as rich as the company that bought them tells them they are.
[12/6/17, 8:06:56 AM] <Tekitoumei> Megaman~~~~~
[12/6/17, 8:07:17 AM] <Paladin356> i hope that they're going to be good ports of hte X games
[12/6/17, 8:07:25 AM] <WelshAndyT> "pepperonipizza" "Woodstock" "Coinage" "quarry" were the Age of Empires resource cheats I used to use
[12/6/17, 8:07:31 AM] <vanwagoner> The resolution is digitally enhanced, not optically, @Zismarith . :P
[12/6/17, 8:07:37 AM] <TalaTag> Megachild
[12/6/17, 8:07:39 AM] <Tekitoumei> Such a long wait
[12/6/17, 8:07:43 AM] <Paladin356> what about "It is a good day to die" from warcraft 2
[12/6/17, 8:08:12 AM] <Paladin356> honestly, im more excited about this style than the style that they used in MM9 and 10
[12/6/17, 8:08:17 AM] <Paladin356> i hope Proto Man is coming back
[12/6/17, 8:08:22 AM] <Zismarith> I can't tell the difference, frankly 720 and 1080 look identical no matter how carefully I look. @vanwagoner
[12/6/17, 8:08:48 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> I had always hoped to see a mega man game with a bunch of different playable characters. Kinda like Mario 2 but even more players
[12/6/17, 8:08:53 AM] <vanwagoner> @Zismarith There is screen tear.
[12/6/17, 8:09:25 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Zismarith did you say Frankie in 720 looks identical with Frankie in 1080p?
[12/6/17, 8:09:26 AM] <Zismarith> I got nothing.
[12/6/17, 8:09:32 AM] <TalaTag> 28o in the Crucible? Pfft.
[12/6/17, 8:09:41 AM] <stiffcamel> just in time for christmas
[12/6/17, 8:09:42 AM] <Paladin356> aww, i can't pair this with the alexa at my job
[12/6/17, 8:09:43 AM] <MrNY2Cali> and combine voice control with VR/AR and the future is now
[12/6/17, 8:09:45 AM] <MajorCheri> using a legendary rocket launcher on goblins? pff
[12/6/17, 8:10:01 AM] <WelshAndyT> If you're going to do a game with voice commands, then it has to be Star Trek, seeing as the ships have voice command controls on the shows, so you'd REALLY feel like a captain
[12/6/17, 8:10:02 AM] <stargazer1977> seaman
[12/6/17, 8:10:03 AM] <Tekitoumei> dreamcast?
[12/6/17, 8:10:07 AM] <MajorCheri> sea man or something
[12/6/17, 8:10:08 AM] <Biohybrid> I remember that Saints Row IV's Xbox One port had voice commands too
[12/6/17, 8:10:08 AM] <MattTaylor512> Seaman?
[12/6/17, 8:10:08 AM] <ArtofBartlett> SEAMAN!
[12/6/17, 8:10:09 AM] <Marb_04> that wsa a ps1 or ps2 game]
[12/6/17, 8:10:10 AM] <Zismarith> Sorry, whomever spoke to me right there with an orange name, I refreshed at that exact moment.
[12/6/17, 8:10:12 AM] <theshadowsstrike> seaman
[12/6/17, 8:10:14 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Destiny 2 free for its trial, its a good time to test it out
[12/6/17, 8:10:17 AM] <TalaTag> Seaman!
[12/6/17, 8:10:18 AM] <Paladin356> Seaman
[12/6/17, 8:10:22 AM] <Paladin356> dont forget Hey You Pikachu!
[12/6/17, 8:10:27 AM] <kadsreal> who calls a game seaman
[12/6/17, 8:10:28 AM] <Paladin356> there was Lifeline on PS2
[12/6/17, 8:10:33 AM] <TalaTag> Seaman on the Dreamcast
[12/6/17, 8:10:35 AM] <Tekitoumei> sea man on dreamcast with leonard nimoy as the fish?
[12/6/17, 8:10:37 AM] <mlm_490> Seaman on dreamcast
[12/6/17, 8:10:43 AM] <Paladin356> TalaTag Sega Apparently
[12/6/17, 8:10:53 AM] <kadsreal> apparently so
[12/6/17, 8:10:56 AM] <Critternation3000> jcvimHi erika jcvimHi trisha
[12/6/17, 8:11:07 AM] <Paladin356> i mean, this IS the same company who made a game where a guy keeps looking for Sailors
[12/6/17, 8:11:15 AM] <gigglingwarlock> pretty sure elite 3 has voice integration too
[12/6/17, 8:11:24 AM] <MrNY2Cali> and get Insteon sensors and you won't even have to use your voice
[12/6/17, 8:11:26 AM] <kadsreal> it all makes sense then
[12/6/17, 8:11:50 AM] <TalaTag> Also Odama on the Gamecube used the mic.
[12/6/17, 8:11:55 AM] <Biohybrid> I can see Erika muttering like a caveman trying to shut the light off manually. IDK why I find that funny. Sorry Erika!
[12/6/17, 8:12:26 AM] <Paladin356> that looks like Jennifer Lawrence
[12/6/17, 8:12:30 AM] <Tekitoumei> Short sketch idea: Erika yelling at lightswitches to turn off and on like a madwoman
[12/6/17, 8:12:32 AM] <TalaTag> Odama, created by the same dude as Seaman, fact-fans.
[12/6/17, 8:13:42 AM] <MajorCheri> Y'all expecting this game to be good when it's by the same dude who made Omikron and Indigo Prophecy. Do not believe the lies.
[12/6/17, 8:13:43 AM] <stargazer1977> No, if this is an art form, it has to address uncomfortable subjects. If you don't like it, don't play it. But you don't get to censor.
[12/6/17, 8:14:05 AM] <Tekitoumei> ....is this kind of stuff not in movies and tv too?
[12/6/17, 8:14:14 AM] <treemoss> Wife Beater 2k19
[12/6/17, 8:14:17 AM] <gigglingwarlock> agreed @stargazer1977
[12/6/17, 8:14:18 AM] <Ezii_SH> ^
[12/6/17, 8:14:31 AM] <Biohybrid> But the game brings the aspect of Domestic Violence to light. It makes it an issue like this to a forefront. If we leave it in the shadows, it never gets fixed!
[12/6/17, 8:14:53 AM] <littelnemo> WAIT if they are going after that should we go after all the xman movies and cartoon and comics
[12/6/17, 8:14:59 AM] <stargazer1977> We already self censor games way too much, it will never reach the peaks of literature at this rate. Books have long addressed uncomfortable subjects, and that's a large reason why it's considered peak art.

[12/6/17, 8:15:07 AM] <gigasplit> Representatives so out of touch
[12/6/17, 8:15:07 AM] <danaclay> but... domestic abuse happens? I'd have to see the full context. if it's being made light of, not cool. if not... how does it make it trivial?
[12/6/17, 8:15:11 AM] <WelshAndyT> Well think about games like Grand Theft Auto, you beat hookers to steal their money and you shoot cops and run over kids, it's not normalizing anything and hasn't lead to an increase in violence
[12/6/17, 8:15:11 AM] <Zentiseon> The same argument can be said for TYV shows and movies, but do they pull those off the air? No. They see it as a platform. Why can't "games" do the same.
[12/6/17, 8:15:14 AM] <Ezii_SH> sounds like old fashioned thinking
[12/6/17, 8:15:18 AM] <zeldandroid> Its not seen in a positive light and why is that wrong but killing in games is okay?
[12/6/17, 8:15:31 AM] <cedon> its just like comic books are only for children, same argument
[12/6/17, 8:15:35 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> Games have evolved. To make a complex and engaging story sometimes you have to use complex and controversial themes.
[12/6/17, 8:15:38 AM] <stargazer1977> Domestic violence is already in movies, I can list up many of them. They just aren't usually put out by Hollywood.
[12/6/17, 8:15:39 AM] <animusMR> don't really have much faith in David Cage to do a good job with this, but saying it should be pulled is ridiculous
[12/6/17, 8:15:49 AM] <Zentiseon> It's not like they're making "Domestic Abuse Simulator"
[12/6/17, 8:15:53 AM] <limpcrust> We keep censoring stuff, developers creativity is going to be narrowed.

[12/6/17, 8:16:06 AM] <TDotTerror> Ye ol' Manhunt.
[12/6/17, 8:16:09 AM] <Zismarith> Hatred?
[12/6/17, 8:16:10 AM] <WelshAndyT> If you're a parent and you buy your 12 year old a 18 rated game, then that's on you and not the game industry
[12/6/17, 8:16:12 AM] <littelnemo> how many disneys movies do we have to bann now
[12/6/17, 8:16:14 AM] <MrNY2Cali> I say if it fits with what the Director is trying to convey in the story scene then I would say its fine.
[12/6/17, 8:16:16 AM] <Paladin356> itst like when Night Trap came out, people were claiming it was glorifying killing women
[12/6/17, 8:16:17 AM] <Dredstryde> @GeekandSundry These quotes are just people who haven't come to terms with video games as a legitimate artistic medium.
[12/6/17, 8:16:33 AM] <Gkgamerfan> Right, what Erika was saying. There are a lot of traumatic movies that deal with serious issues, you "could" say that it "trivializes" them by putting them in a movie for "entertainment". It all depends on how it's done.
[12/6/17, 8:16:38 AM] <gungadi> I am alright with this. From both a person who suffered through child abuse and to have a means of even if fictional to interact and put a stop to it.. Or if it empowers and gives someone the idea of stepping in on when they know about it, and take actiopn it might stop a child from having to live with that.
[12/6/17, 8:16:55 AM] <Akeeba1st> I'm rather old, over 40. However, I agree that games as story-tellers can be productive depending on the outcome intended and available.
[12/6/17, 8:17:10 AM] <Grading> gandsSubHype gandsSubHype
[12/6/17, 8:17:22 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> It's a game geared at an older audience. This isn't Mario abusing toad to further a shallow story.
[12/6/17, 8:17:31 AM] <Ezii_SH> isnt Liam the one that always says "Art should make you feel uncomfrotable"??
[12/6/17, 8:17:41 AM] <stargazer1977> I personally love David Cage games, Heavy Rain is my favorite, but I love Beyond: Two Souls as well. I really don't care that they aren't popular or well loved, you shouldn't be making games by committee for everyone to love anyway.
[12/6/17, 8:17:42 AM] <potterboi111> Games are the best way to bring some current events to a new audience in a different and less conflicting way whilst not glorifying the issue at hand
[12/6/17, 8:17:57 AM] <Gkgamerfan> Yeah.. forgetting atrocities only makes us more likely to repeat that history.
[12/6/17, 8:18:08 AM] <Trophyscars89> Hello just curious what will be playing in talks machinas spot tonight?
[12/6/17, 8:18:13 AM] <blackmarketbingo> Was that Liam testing his mic?
[12/6/17, 8:18:20 AM] <SprlngheelJack> Topics like this have been brought up concerning creative works time and time again. We've been having this conversation for as long as we've had the ability to tell stories. As long as it isn't portraying violence like this in a positive light, it should stay.
[12/6/17, 8:18:25 AM] <Zentiseon> testing testing
[12/6/17, 8:18:26 AM] <PrincessQuill> hi liam
