[12/7/17, 8:09:47 AM] <Andyinsomnia> "I don't have a catchphrase" is a very good catchphrase
[12/7/17, 8:09:57 AM] <Zismarith> I think that's already Becca's motto.
[12/7/17, 8:10:01 AM] <Critternation3000> @danoba quick to the prop closet hats for all LUL
[12/7/17, 8:10:22 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I didn't have a catchphrase before not having a catchphrase was cool
[12/7/17, 8:10:34 AM] <Danoba> @Critternation3000 That needed to happen about 10 minutes ago, haha.
[12/7/17, 8:11:24 AM] <chaoticloony> I encourage Crazy!

[12/7/17, 8:12:57 AM] <harberst> @Zismarith I would've thought Becca's motto was more along the lines of "I always win"
[12/7/17, 8:13:06 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Is that an Oshi Ocus token?
[12/7/17, 8:13:15 AM] <chaoticloony> Orcus tokens would be cooler!

[12/7/17, 8:17:28 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> what does being Winter mean? no Sowing?
[12/7/17, 8:17:35 AM] <starpilotsix> I really do like the design of the game, it definitely succeeds at seeming like an old-timey classic game from an alternate universe or something.
[12/7/17, 8:17:39 AM] <twogetherstudios> Correct
