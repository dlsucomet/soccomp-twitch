[12/7/17, 11:04:24 AM] <Sylien_> @misssunflower94 Woke up early, since I needed something nice like Taliesin crawling the walls from happiness, to help me with my sadness over breaking up with my now ex datemate.

[12/7/17, 11:05:14 AM] <mathemagician_> Taliesin ranting like a crazy person excites me
[12/7/17, 11:05:19 AM] <halfaringcircus> I already know this isn't my thing, but I'm still excited to witness the enthusiasm.
[12/7/17, 11:05:26 AM] <artistsomeday> Oooo! I have a sloth icon now! Yay!
[12/7/17, 11:05:28 AM] <SprlngheelJack> Taliesin said Glasgow corret
[12/7/17, 11:05:31 AM] <SprlngheelJack> *correct

[12/7/17, 11:05:49 AM] <owifig> Give us some william mcgonagall, taliesin
[12/7/17, 11:05:49 AM] <starpilotsix> Fun fact: Rime of the Ancient Mariner can be sung to the tune of the Gilligan's Island Theme song.
[12/7/17, 11:05:56 AM] <warlord_82> cool art

[12/7/17, 11:06:13 AM] <rasnac_khan> @knhaw Moscow?
[12/7/17, 11:06:20 AM] <RuzgofDI> QUESTION: If you're using Morrison this year, what are you saving for a "We're tired, here's one of us ranting for 2 hours" topic for next December?
[12/7/17, 11:06:21 AM] <crthemighty> that's neat, but i still hate rime of the ancient mariner :D
[12/7/17, 11:06:33 AM] <tortugadelmar> Lol. "which universe?"
[12/7/17, 11:06:34 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype ramaHype gandsSubHype
[12/7/17, 11:06:37 AM] <igilboa1> Grant Morrison being Taliesin's dad is Tal's headcanon.
[12/7/17, 11:06:42 AM] <halfaringcircus> Tradition requires you fight to the death. He's your dad, after all.
[12/7/17, 11:06:44 AM] <Sylien_> Good to know that while we imagine Taliesin adopting us, Taliesin imagines being adopted by Grant Morrison
[12/7/17, 11:06:45 AM] <misssunflower94> we're less than five minutes in and he's just the most fangirl
[12/7/17, 11:06:48 AM] <phoenixgoth> Good evening, Taliesin and Amy and Matt!
[12/7/17, 11:06:50 AM] <Leigh574> oh wow
[12/7/17, 11:06:51 AM] <rasnac_khan> Unpopular opinion: Grant Morrison is discount Alan Moore.
[12/7/17, 11:06:56 AM] <phoenixgoth> 10 cat Tal mood I think
[12/7/17, 11:07:00 AM] <tortugadelmar> That map is so useful
[12/7/17, 11:07:05 AM] <chiplickin> Whoaaaaa!
[12/7/17, 11:07:08 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> :D
[12/7/17, 11:07:08 AM] <misssunflower94> Grant Morrison is Goth Dad's Dad
[12/7/17, 11:07:10 AM] <Sylien_> Definitely 10 cat mood
[12/7/17, 11:07:15 AM] <Sylien_> broke the cat mood scale
[12/7/17, 11:07:16 AM] <owifig> @starpilotsix Oh my god... amazing
[12/7/17, 11:07:20 AM] <Sylien_> 10/9 cats
[12/7/17, 11:07:20 AM] <Leigh574> lol tired taliesin is so fun
[12/7/17, 11:07:24 AM] <CharacterStigma> PogChamp So glad I could catch this episode
[12/7/17, 11:07:26 AM] <artistsomeday> @phoenixgoth Easily ten cats. He's gonna go to eleven
[12/7/17, 11:07:28 AM] <ModernChow> Matt Key aka Darin Depaul Handler
[12/7/17, 11:07:33 AM] <101deadpool1017> @rasnac_khan burn the heretic!
[12/7/17, 11:07:36 AM] <ladyamphy> He may go to 15 cat
[12/7/17, 11:07:41 AM] <mathemagician_> This delights me
[12/7/17, 11:07:57 AM] <Sylien_> I think we'll see him increase in cats throughout the episode.
[12/7/17, 11:08:05 AM] <m121akuma> Even More Unpopular Opinion: Final Crisis is the best Event Comic of all time
[12/7/17, 11:08:08 AM] <Henchman2121> @rasnac_khan Alan Moore is my hero.
[12/7/17, 11:08:08 AM] <japenrose> @ImSylien So he gained an extra life?
[12/7/17, 11:08:12 AM] <ToonEzon> my twitch is going all slow and shitty, I hate that I'm missing this
[12/7/17, 11:08:14 AM] <misssunflower94> I'm just picturing a dial that we keep turning up
[12/7/17, 11:08:20 AM] <herladykrow> Giggling Taliesin is best Taliesin
[12/7/17, 11:08:26 AM] <artistsomeday> I'm 8 cats just watching his cat level rise
[12/7/17, 11:08:43 AM] <halafell> do they have a bunch of pop tart pillows?
[12/7/17, 11:08:44 AM] <Sylien_> @japenrose possibly? I mean, it there's anyone who could give you an extra life, it's grant morrison
[12/7/17, 11:08:44 AM] <misssunflower94> watching Amy watch Taliesin like #same
[12/7/17, 11:08:52 AM] <super390> Wait, which sun can a vampire Superman get his power from?

[12/7/17, 11:09:02 AM] <japenrose> @ImSylien Definitely true, definitely true
[12/7/17, 11:09:06 AM] <markthedavies75> Wonder if Taliesen will mention 2000AD
[12/7/17, 11:09:20 AM] <lark7911> pot tart pillows were made on mines and crafts last week
[12/7/17, 11:09:24 AM] <misssunflower94> Taliesin, dear, Ily but we've already gotten REALLY deep
[12/7/17, 11:09:26 AM] <101deadpool1017> It's Great!
[12/7/17, 11:09:27 AM] <Leigh574> it's grrrrreat ;)

[12/7/17, 11:09:33 AM] <Sylien_> @phoenixgoth same, after breaking up with my now ex, I was at like, 2. This is helping a lot.
[12/7/17, 11:09:36 AM] <JeffM0307> DC-Frosted Flakes crossver :P
[12/7/17, 11:09:36 AM] <Henchman2121> Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Alex Ross...my top 3
[12/7/17, 11:09:37 AM] <Ricky_Galletti> The scary thing is Amy could totally steal the show from Taliesin and secretly turn this into a X-Men episode by just talking about 'New X-Men' by Grant Morrison arguing that it fits in the "context" of the episode. Keep an eye on Amy everyone, she's a tricky one when it comes to the X-men lol :D
[12/7/17, 11:09:40 AM] <JC_Wijma> Taliesin has a lot of books in his bathroom.
[12/7/17, 11:09:41 AM] <halafell> thanks @lark7911
[12/7/17, 11:09:42 AM] <japenrose> I now REALLY want to see Tony the Tiger in comics
[12/7/17, 11:09:43 AM] <CharacterStigma> Keepo They're Great
[12/7/17, 11:09:47 AM] <JeffM0307> *crossover
[12/7/17, 11:09:54 AM] <halfaringcircus> I was also wondering when Warner Brothers bought a cereal company.
[12/7/17, 11:09:57 AM] <super390> Tony is Talky's illegitimate son. There was a brothel in Toon Town.
[12/7/17, 11:10:21 AM] <halafell> man, now i want poptarts though. I haven't had them in like 2 years.
[12/7/17, 11:10:24 AM] <KineticNoetic> Sometimes I wonder if Amy is just 3 kittens and 2 puppies in a human suit
[12/7/17, 11:10:25 AM] <Sylien_> Blue periods? like women in feminine hygiene product commercials?
[12/7/17, 11:10:33 AM] <youareivan> all star superman was amazing
[12/7/17, 11:10:40 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @halfaringcircus well they do have a water tower so owning a cereal company is a good move
[12/7/17, 11:10:46 AM] <artistsomeday> @ImSylien Noooooo
[12/7/17, 11:11:16 AM] <Sylien_> @animavisionary I'm not even sorry
[12/7/17, 11:11:19 AM] <super390> @KineticNoetic I'm thinking it's more like Power Ranger Zords.
[12/7/17, 11:11:22 AM] <MeggieMay328> Blue period like art - I can't explain this but there are 1800s artiest who have blue periods
[12/7/17, 11:11:24 AM] <halfaringcircus> @Deathstar_Taco But only if they change it to a refrigerated milk tower.
[12/7/17, 11:11:32 AM] <super390> Piloted by kittens and puppies.
[12/7/17, 11:11:35 AM] <SprlngheelJack> He's from Glasgow, ofcourse he's a politicaly edgy, its sort of our thing
[12/7/17, 11:11:37 AM] <artistsomeday> @ImSylien Oh I'm sure you're not ;)
[12/7/17, 11:11:46 AM] <japenrose> Oh no, the fanboy streams are crossing!
[12/7/17, 11:11:53 AM] <CharacterStigma> BlessRNG
[12/7/17, 11:12:04 AM] <phoenixgoth> ... absurdist supervillain group, that's interesting.
[12/7/17, 11:12:06 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @halfaringcircus unless they own powered milk company... but we all know that isn't preferred
[12/7/17, 11:12:06 AM] <chiplickin> #forthoseofyouwhodontknow
[12/7/17, 11:12:17 AM] <youareivan> we3 was also awesome
[12/7/17, 11:12:17 AM] <SprlngheelJack> Memes are Dada
[12/7/17, 11:12:24 AM] <misssunflower94> take a drink
[12/7/17, 11:12:30 AM] <Tacotownindustries> Dadaismus
[12/7/17, 11:12:30 AM] <phoenixgoth> Pffffft
[12/7/17, 11:12:34 AM] <Sylien_> I love the Brotherhood of Dada
[12/7/17, 11:12:43 AM] <KineticNoetic> @super390 I'd say it's cannon. Amy is a Zord for cute baby animals
[12/7/17, 11:12:43 AM] <artistsomeday> I am so enjoying this
[12/7/17, 11:12:48 AM] <ToonEzon> god I hat that I missed so much

[12/7/17, 11:13:35 AM] <japenrose> What?
[12/7/17, 11:13:39 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Won't somebody think of the children?!

[12/7/17, 11:13:59 AM] <Sylien_> QUESTION: Taliesin, Taliesin, I know you're fanboying like crazy, and while that's adorable, could you please start from the beginning?
[12/7/17, 11:14:06 AM] <rasnac_khan> As an art historian, I really dig all the modern art references :)
[12/7/17, 11:14:08 AM] <knhaw> built like a brutalist brick house
[12/7/17, 11:14:21 AM] <artistsomeday> Great question Syl
[12/7/17, 11:14:23 AM] <chiplickin> ... Looking up brutalist architecture....
