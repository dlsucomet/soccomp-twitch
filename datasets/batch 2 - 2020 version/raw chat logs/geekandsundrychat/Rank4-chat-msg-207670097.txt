[12/8/17, 8:08:42 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi Amy and Raiders
[12/8/17, 8:08:43 AM] <starpilotsix> I wasn't a huge Christopher Pike reader, but I did remember reading an loving "Remember Me?" which was from the perspective of the ghost of a murdered girl which blew my mind as a kid and now that I think of it might have set a pattern for things that I've liked.

[12/8/17, 8:09:08 AM] <Leigh574> I was at a thrift store looking at books and saw "OH vampire series" so grabbed it. (forget which one it was, it was a while ago)
[12/8/17, 8:09:10 AM] <cinphoria> that was not supposed to be quite THAT effusive. Sorry mods
[12/8/17, 8:09:17 AM] <teh_spikey> Oh dang, I love Jody's hair
[12/8/17, 8:09:19 AM] <the_dismuke> Question from the peanut gallery - for those of who might not know, who is Christopher Pike? Besides an author of presumably vampire novels.
[12/8/17, 8:09:23 AM] <TheBurningFist> happy birthday aliza doogBirthday doogBirthday

[12/8/17, 8:12:17 AM] <derekleeketchum> oh gosh, I remember B. Dalton's
[12/8/17, 8:12:25 AM] <philosoph0001> !wtfisthis
[12/8/17, 8:12:25 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green and a guest spend 90 minutes going deeper into a fandom then you may have thought possible. From Magic: The Gathering to Street Fighter we’re examining the stories and worldbuilding that makes these properties so enchanting. The guests and subjects are as varied as can be but the one thing that brings them together is passion. Today Jody and Aliza steal the show!
[12/8/17, 8:12:28 AM] <doomguide> Snow in Austin. Strange times
[12/8/17, 8:12:57 AM] <FuffyButt> back in my day you could get 3 books for ten dollars
[12/8/17, 8:13:05 AM] <super390> I remember buying Peanuts paperback collections new at newstands for 35 cents. I remember it because once I got a silver war nickel in change.
[12/8/17, 8:13:11 AM] <Zismarith> B.Dalton's. Crown Books. Star Books. Border's. All gone. Only B&N remains.
[12/8/17, 8:13:56 AM] <starpilotsix> Do they say "hello fellow human teenagers" because that's a dead giveaway usually.
[12/8/17, 8:14:18 AM] <doomguide> There are a still a few good local stores depending where you are
[12/8/17, 8:14:53 AM] <chaoticloony> The only time i payed attention to the YA section of the book store was to find the CYOA style game books!

[12/8/17, 8:15:03 AM] <crthemighty> i remember skipping from youth group to read star wars books at b. daltons
[12/8/17, 8:15:05 AM] <vankeet> my Pike books came from a salvation army book crate
[12/8/17, 8:15:25 AM] <starpilotsix> Remember Me is the only Pike one I remember reading, although I probably read a few of the others

[12/8/17, 8:17:35 AM] <teh_spikey> When I was a teen I used to avoid Christopher Pike, due to being too obsessed with RL Stine (before Goosebumps came out when he was just doing YA) and I had this impression that Stine was somehow "better"
[12/8/17, 8:17:35 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> yeah airbending is cool :) firebending is fun too :)
