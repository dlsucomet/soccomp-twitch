[12/9/17, 8:12:13 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Danoba also "Dick & Johnson have to do a Totally Different Morning Show"
[12/9/17, 8:12:24 AM] <FuffyButt> that is not how physics works,
[12/9/17, 8:12:29 AM] <Danoba> @Deathstar_Taco Yes and it's not in the morning either.

[12/9/17, 8:13:28 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Danoba maybe call it "Filmed when it is Convenient"
[12/9/17, 8:13:36 AM] <tsmith64> Naturs is way better
[12/9/17, 8:13:50 AM] <Critternation3000> was The SOT episode Dick&Johnson canon? and in the wiki
[12/9/17, 8:13:57 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype ramaHype
[12/9/17, 8:13:58 AM] <salty_penguin_54> Wait I got here late. What exactly is going on?
[12/9/17, 8:14:20 AM] <tsmith64> I think they said it's part of D&J canon but not SOT canon.
[12/9/17, 8:14:36 AM] <Danoba> @Deathstar_Taco That could be the episode title.
[12/9/17, 8:14:39 AM] <Danoba> @TheDiMono Also true.
[12/9/17, 8:15:18 AM] <Critternation3000> @tsmith64 SeemsGood
[12/9/17, 8:15:32 AM] <shidareAKI> @Critternation3000 it is D&J canon, yes.
[12/9/17, 8:15:32 AM] <ThePoshPanda> over yonder in time
[12/9/17, 8:15:51 AM] <shidareAKI> And it was meant to be added to the wiki.

[12/9/17, 8:16:02 AM] <super390> During the Sailing Era, you could of course have powered a ship using a donkey and a treadmill, and that would not have been a Tall Ship. If you used a giraffe, on the other hand...
[12/9/17, 8:16:16 AM] <lizardbreath27> this explains so much!

[12/9/17, 8:20:06 AM] <tsmith64> Shouldn't they be playing Fist Gator Missile?
[12/9/17, 8:20:26 AM] <super390> @shidareAKI I was at Kadena Air Base '69-73, and Futenma Housing Area '76-79. I was born at an army hospital there in '64.
[12/9/17, 8:20:54 AM] <FuffyButt> the car is powered by a panda in a giant hamster wheel
[12/9/17, 8:21:01 AM] <shidareAKI> That's amazing @super390! I lived in Kadena from 87-94.

[12/9/17, 8:21:53 AM] <super390> @shidareAKI Well, by then all the USAF people were at Kadena. There used to be other air bases on Okinawa. And army bases.
[12/9/17, 8:22:33 AM] <shidareAKI> Yup, Dad was AF. But yeah, I admittedly have never seen Tokyo Drift all the way through XD
