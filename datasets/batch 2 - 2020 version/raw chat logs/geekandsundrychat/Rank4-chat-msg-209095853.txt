[12/13/17, 10:48:42 AM] <DuhMinja> I'd say, one on one, druid for the win.....but it really depends on who the rest of the people team up on (or don't team up on).
[12/13/17, 10:48:44 AM] <Altair_Saosin> And they don't stop comin' and they don't stop comin' and they don't stop comin'...

[12/13/17, 10:49:21 AM] <Altair_Saosin> This is a man who knows how to threaten. I like.
[12/13/17, 10:49:23 AM] <badger1k2> ...You know Chris, you make a very good point there with that sword.
[12/13/17, 10:49:24 AM] <SnazzySora> what can a warlock and artificer do at lvl 20?
[12/13/17, 10:49:44 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> I see intimidation but no bribery...
[12/13/17, 10:49:47 AM] <Altair_Saosin> Damn, there's the seduction tactic.

[12/13/17, 10:49:59 AM] <ladysanrio> The whole crew rocks.
[12/13/17, 10:50:11 AM] <jeffrey_lindsey> We saw how powerful a Druid could be. But I'm curious what a Wizard and Warlock would be like at level 20.
[12/13/17, 10:50:14 AM] <pyromanicfeline> depends on if she's a moon druid
[12/13/17, 10:50:15 AM] <Tulililli> yeah druid is the only option here, as we learned
[12/13/17, 10:50:19 AM] <Dragonchrome> #ThanksCrew<3

[12/13/17, 10:50:40 AM] <SprlngheelJack> warlock might be in witth a chance depending on how well its played
[12/13/17, 10:50:44 AM] <Zevorous> Lvl 20 clerics Divine intervention just works.
[12/13/17, 10:50:47 AM] <SpeedDemonStar> @GeekandSundry the one who bribes chat wins... so where's my food?
[12/13/17, 10:50:47 AM] <Bellandora> The fact that the crew is doing this makes me happy.

[12/13/17, 10:50:56 AM] <Khreegor> I don't see a strawpoll
[12/13/17, 10:50:59 AM] <raijunkain> depending on if they let them choose magic items, the artificer can attune to 6 at level 20 :O
[12/13/17, 10:51:04 AM] <Altair_Saosin> Oh shit.
[12/13/17, 10:51:05 AM] <Sir_Shark_Dude> LUL
