[12/13/17, 8:02:38 AM] <dayntee> I feel like Trishika actually sounds like a name. Erikish sounds like the definition of something "Erika-like"

[12/13/17, 8:07:44 AM] <jamm_jars> yeah, definite camel toe in PUBG, it was weird
[12/13/17, 8:07:45 AM] <Intyalle> I was wondering whatthe huge deal about saying lamia was

[12/13/17, 8:08:25 AM] <Wayticus> Yes I saw the change when Vana was playing the other day thanks to her no pants.
[12/13/17, 8:08:25 AM] <dayntee> To be honest, if I'm being shot at, a wedgie is the last thing I'm worrying about.
[12/13/17, 8:08:28 AM] <KBTibbs> I didn't know PUBG was going in that direction.
[12/13/17, 8:08:36 AM] <chiplickin> Work that out before you run in, you know?

[12/13/17, 8:14:10 AM] <consuela3> oh, now they are shy about saying it
[12/13/17, 8:14:21 AM] <Ezii_SH> should have saved Death Stranding for PSX instead of game awards
[12/13/17, 8:14:30 AM] <Compel_Bast> To be honest, the best part of the Game Awards was the orchestra. I'd rather have watched 3 hours of them playing...
[12/13/17, 8:14:39 AM] <Little_Tito> Hi @consuela3 !
[12/13/17, 8:14:50 AM] <djregular> One big thing that didn't work was the fact that so many of the award announcements were sort of blown through at a rapid pace. You'd get time taken away from the awards for what amounted to advertising, then they'd blow through like three or four award winners with no real fanfare.

[12/13/17, 8:16:52 AM] <djregular> @dayntee Oh I know, but it was especially egregious here. Plus in Oscars/Grammys, you aren't getting basically adverts in place of those awards.
[12/13/17, 8:17:00 AM] <Little_Tito> The art style is unique
