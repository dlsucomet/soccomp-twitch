[12/13/17, 1:14:08 PM] <Nightbot> There are no grills in the studio. There are girls, although they usually prefer to be called skull crushing immortals. If you are seeing grills where none exist, you should see a doctor. However, Ryan did put a grill in the back of the studio for when he wants to cook vegetable fajitas so that one is okay.
[12/13/17, 1:14:17 PM] <CripplingStudentDebt> HE is only Senator because of the terrible Trump Bump

[12/13/17, 1:14:32 PM] <Chovexani> Where's Dragonchromes sword at this point?
[12/13/17, 1:14:47 PM] <CripplingStudentDebt> @Fu4ow absolutely
[12/13/17, 1:14:50 PM] <The_TBoyce> And if FCC Chairman Ajit Pai does repeal Net Neutrality, Congress can still vote to reinstate Title II regulations through new legislation, so it is important to call your Representatives and Senators too.
[12/13/17, 1:14:52 PM] <Fu4ow> @Andyinsomnia did* DID oppose net neutrality

[12/13/17, 1:17:40 PM] <The_TBoyce> Ajit Pai was at this dinner in DC with all these ISP corporate executives, and he made a joke about being a corporate plant by Verizon. He then showed a 14 year-old video of him (back when he was a Verizon employee) where he is straight-up declaring his intent to repeal Net Neutrality someday. Pai thought this was a "joke".
