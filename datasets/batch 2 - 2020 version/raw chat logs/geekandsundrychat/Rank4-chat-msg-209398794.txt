[12/14/17, 11:03:19 AM] <Capefoxalix> it looks like it dissolved the flesh around the candy bone..
[12/14/17, 11:03:19 AM] <tomservo544> Mint is a terrible flavor for candy and ice cream
[12/14/17, 11:03:20 AM] <NeverwinterFool> Taliesin has a #StayTurnt shirt! I thought I was the only one.

[12/14/17, 11:04:56 AM] <louislelion> @talahar @John_Sparks_Jr yeah, there's no doubt that d&d 5e is a good compromise between an old school game, a simulationist one and the new simplified ones
[12/14/17, 11:05:06 AM] <super390> I will put in a plug here for two comic specials written by Bob Burden in the '90s; "Gumby Summer Fun Special" and "Gumby Winter Fun Special."

[12/14/17, 11:05:17 AM] <misssunflower94> oh god Taliesin what are you doing
[12/14/17, 11:05:18 AM] <Factorofunknowns> @cinphoria Right. Also, I still haven't come up with any activities for TJFC that aren't absurdly stupid. I'm still working on it. (I'm hiddengoth)

[12/14/17, 11:05:46 AM] <dervish3> I'm trying to imagine Taliesin festive.
[12/14/17, 11:05:47 AM] <m121akuma> Jerry Siegel wrote it? Continuing the traditions of the Jewish people creating Christmas popular culture in America. You're welcome!
[12/14/17, 11:05:49 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @louislelion Yeah, the only thing I'm awaiting is more unique class schematics. There was a few in 3.5 that were a bit specialized that I loved.
[12/14/17, 11:05:51 AM] <misssunflower94> hot topic is grown up hot topic imo

[12/14/17, 11:08:30 AM] <louislelion> @John_Sparks_Jr well, i haven't seen anything like it yet, but I guess wizard's policy is now to leave more space to the community (since it's OGC) to bring such classes and subclasses, that's clever to them, they' assured that the game will remain pretty much alive and fed
[12/14/17, 11:08:44 AM] <japenrose> @tomservo544 You are in spirit if not in discord!
