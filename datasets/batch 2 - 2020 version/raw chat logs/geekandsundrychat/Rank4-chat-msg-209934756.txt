[12/16/17, 8:05:44 AM] <super390> For the fight scenes, we should switch over to that video game where you get image-captured and then the image fights hordes of cultists in masks.

[12/16/17, 8:06:46 AM] <postdataest> !notdnd
[12/16/17, 8:06:46 AM] <Nightbot> Twitch doesn't have a generic RPG tag, so all RPGs get identified as D&D. It is a limitation of the platform.
[12/16/17, 8:06:52 AM] <zhetty> :D
[12/16/17, 8:07:05 AM] <postdataest> !bubblegum
[12/16/17, 8:07:05 AM] <Nightbot> You came here to chew Bubblegum and watch an RPG. Check out the rules for Dick & Johnson's RPG system here, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2e00cd265c8628d4fb13

[12/16/17, 8:07:51 AM] <Critternation3000> WHO SENT THESE CARTOONS?
[12/16/17, 8:08:01 AM] <starpilotsix> It's dungeons and dragons, but the dungeon is named Dick, and the dragon is named Johnson. Or maybe it's the other way around.
[12/16/17, 8:08:04 AM] <16bitEric> "OPEN YOUR EYES ABOUT IT"
[12/16/17, 8:08:05 AM] <littelnemo> this is great!
[12/16/17, 8:08:31 AM] <DangerDuckofDoom> I think the chief should be the dragon and Dick and Johnson can be themselves
[12/16/17, 8:08:32 AM] <super390> does Chief have facepalm capability?
[12/16/17, 8:08:37 AM] <Lprether> I hope he doesn‚Äôt do that at the school lol
