[12/16/17, 1:13:44 PM] <mathemagician_> The jokes are meant to be bad becuase then everyone agrees they're terrible, instead of dividing the room
[12/16/17, 1:13:50 PM] <LavenderTownsGhost> @hail_wuzzle It's basically a bunch of friends hanging out and we pretend that we're hanging out with them
[12/16/17, 1:13:53 PM] <misssunflower94> Erika how hot is it in that hat?
