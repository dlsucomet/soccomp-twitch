[12/19/17, 11:03:03 AM] <tomservo544> I'm not excited about the new schedule but I have faith it'll get better
[12/19/17, 11:03:04 AM] <Bitgod> I gotta wonder if moving to Friday's means less Bonnie, cuz that may affect her going out of town for the Bards
[12/19/17, 11:03:06 AM] <that_bjorn_guy> Guess no JCVIM
[12/19/17, 11:03:07 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @megjane42 @Mishoniko

[12/19/17, 11:04:09 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> For the record, Bonnie's Mrs. Claus rewrote my whole childhood earlier this weekend :O
[12/19/17, 11:04:16 AM] <Everyclass> Yay!!!
[12/19/17, 11:04:26 AM] <WhiteNekoKnight> CBS giving this show the OK has increased my respect for them greatly.
[12/19/17, 11:04:30 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Blessings, i hope you got my picture I sent. :) <3
[12/19/17, 11:04:30 AM] ** shidareAKI We understand that people have feelings and opinions about the new schedule. We encourage everyone to be gentle with our crew/hosts throughout this transition.
[12/19/17, 11:04:31 AM] <talahar> ironically, bonnie is singing "no tribbles!" in the library bards song "all about that space"
[12/19/17, 11:04:33 AM] <chiplickin> Do we get an installment of Sam Loses Their Shit?!!
[12/19/17, 11:04:37 AM] <cinphoria> HI YALL
[12/19/17, 11:04:44 AM] <Zismarith> @WhiteNekoKnight Yeap.

[12/19/17, 11:05:09 AM] <dilandau87> They look so professional in their outfits!
[12/19/17, 11:05:10 AM] <darkofnate> Suggestion for a new Shield of Tomorrow drinking game: take a drink anytime Eric describes something as "rad".
[12/19/17, 11:05:11 AM] <WhiteNekoKnight> Yay stuff!
[12/19/17, 11:05:24 AM] <Gryphon_oFH> lol @talahar indeed she is -- I hadn't even realized that :D
[12/19/17, 11:05:28 AM] <TheComicBookAddict> i cant watch watch after this ep live
[12/19/17, 11:05:39 AM] <MrPingn> @whitenekoknight Might have been an olive branch as well as a subtle means of easing off the rules a little (hopefully)
[12/19/17, 11:05:48 AM] <Kiranova> is there a way i can go back and watch from the begining?
[12/19/17, 11:05:53 AM] <JeffM0307> Double doctor mugs for double coffee!
[12/19/17, 11:05:55 AM] <Kiranova> new to the show

[12/19/17, 11:07:24 AM] <WhiteNekoKnight> @MrPingn They might have also just assumed this won't be that popular so they don't worry about it.
[12/19/17, 11:07:25 AM] <harberst> @cljedi New schedule moves SoT to Fridays, if that was what you were asking.
[12/19/17, 11:07:26 AM] <cinphoria> @Vance1982 doesn't not being able to watch live mean MORE reason to keep your sub, cuz VODs?
[12/19/17, 11:07:30 AM] <darkofnate> @Vance1982 Why would you need to sub to watch live? I sub so I can watch VOD.
[12/19/17, 11:07:34 AM] <NitemarePhoenix> this buffering is killing me
