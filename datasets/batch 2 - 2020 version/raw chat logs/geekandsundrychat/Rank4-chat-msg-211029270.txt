[12/20/17, 8:09:16 AM] <stargazer1977> Back when I played vanilla WoW we had a lot of sound effect mods for our raids. Used movie quotes for situations.
[12/20/17, 8:09:29 AM] <AzureColossus> RuleFive
[12/20/17, 8:09:38 AM] <MrNY2Cali> It will effect Mobile games, and game downloads.
[12/20/17, 8:09:59 AM] <harberst> It'll effect pretty much everything
[12/20/17, 8:10:25 AM] <Dragonchrome> Hosts Erika Ishii twitter.com/erikaishii , Trisha Hershberger twitter.com/thatgrltrish
[12/20/17, 8:10:49 AM] <jammino> hi trisha!
[12/20/17, 8:11:13 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> It will effect head to head gaming as well if they decide they can make $ creating a special tier access for gaming.
[12/20/17, 8:11:25 AM] <jamesisdrunk> Hi
[12/20/17, 8:11:31 AM] <Gkgamerfan> I'm worried about the effect losing Net Neutrality will have streamers that already struggle with poor internet
[12/20/17, 8:11:37 AM] <FuffyButt> also cat videos will be harder to find
[12/20/17, 8:11:57 AM] <MrNY2Cali> hosting costs will most like increase, or some games may be more region locked to cut down on global streaming server costs
[12/20/17, 8:12:18 AM] <Leigh574> lol
[12/20/17, 8:12:30 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Erika Sales hype!

[12/20/17, 8:14:42 AM] <Triamas> there are some games for free in Ubi store right now for PC gamers, including Assassin's Creed Black Flag
[12/20/17, 8:14:52 AM] <MrNY2Cali> believe Playstation is doing their holiday sale also
[12/20/17, 8:14:56 AM] <stargazer1977> Get them Doki Doki Literature Club... it's free, and it will blow their little minds.

[12/20/17, 8:17:13 AM] <Shadowner> Erika still has night terrors
[12/20/17, 8:17:18 AM] <Dragonchrome> !girl
[12/20/17, 8:17:18 AM] <Nightbot> There are no grills in the studio. There are girls, although they usually prefer to be called skull crushing immortals. If you are seeing grills where none exist, you should see a doctor. However, Ryan did put a grill in the back of the studio for when he wants to cook vegetable fajitas so that one is okay.
