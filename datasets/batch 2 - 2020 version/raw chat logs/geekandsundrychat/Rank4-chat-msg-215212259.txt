[01/4/18, 8:09:32 AM] <Danoba> Hey @Mr_Pistol_80
[01/4/18, 8:09:45 AM] <ModernChow> To think people missed out on when bizarre states went to do on location shoots. It’s great stuff! :)
[01/4/18, 8:09:55 AM] <Horror_Guy> @PauladinWon Gotta fill it in. haha
[01/4/18, 8:10:10 AM] <Highfarm73> Well if he didn't know what it was at the time, it was a UFO
[01/4/18, 8:10:16 AM] <Chayat> escapistDrink
[01/4/18, 8:10:17 AM] <Waglagon> Anyone has a UFO story to tell?
[01/4/18, 8:10:19 AM] <Leigh574> @ModernChow their location shows is what got me hooked on their podcast shows
[01/4/18, 8:10:33 AM] <ShandraVdeG> This is actually my first Bizarre States... Yes, I"m late to the party. lol.
[01/4/18, 8:10:44 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> "Looked like crap" does.... this count as a poop story? >_>
[01/4/18, 8:10:50 AM] <Zismarith> @ShandraVdeG Yeah, no me too.
[01/4/18, 8:11:01 AM] <Danoba> @ShandraVdeG Same here.
[01/4/18, 8:11:10 AM] <vexelghost> No UFO, mostly OBE moments.
[01/4/18, 8:11:11 AM] <shidareAKI> All in the same boat
[01/4/18, 8:11:13 AM] <Highfarm73> I've seen UFO's a lot of the time, but took a wild guess it was planes going from one country to another....
[01/4/18, 8:11:16 AM] <shidareAKI> Yay for new things!
[01/4/18, 8:11:20 AM] <diazdragon> @shandravdeg same
[01/4/18, 8:12:18 AM] <Leigh574> Twitter went NUTS when that happened lol
[01/4/18, 8:12:20 AM] <masterloos77> If aliens were smart and wanted to remain low key they could so easily just make all their spacecraft look like our airplanes...
[01/4/18, 8:12:24 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehehe
[01/4/18, 8:12:36 AM] <DrivingMeSpare> heh
[01/4/18, 8:13:06 AM] <Danoba> @masterloos77 I mean they totally could have already.
[01/4/18, 8:13:08 AM] <vexelghost> It's obvious aliens would be all Skrulls and do a Secret Invasion.
[01/4/18, 8:13:18 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype ramaHype
[01/4/18, 8:13:22 AM] <bluelinnet> even if they hadn't put out an alert, they had a duty to notify law enforcement
[01/4/18, 8:13:24 AM] <masterloos77> @Danoba Exactly... O.O
[01/4/18, 8:13:26 AM] <Highfarm73> don't worry, USA has been in a nuclear war before
[01/4/18, 8:13:29 AM] <bluelinnet> so if anyone called they could tell them
[01/4/18, 8:13:36 AM] <ModernChow> @leigh574 nice!
