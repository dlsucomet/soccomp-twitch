[01/5/18, 8:04:38 AM] <Brooster> Borrowed straight from D&D

[01/5/18, 8:05:02 AM] <ohGr> Lore FeelsGoodMan
[01/5/18, 8:05:19 AM] <Kol_Drake> Walked like Egyptians... ðŸŽ¶
[01/5/18, 8:05:36 AM] <YebbaDebba> haha nice @Kol_Drake :D
[01/5/18, 8:05:41 AM] <Brooster> When two titans love each other very much...
[01/5/18, 8:06:09 AM] <YebbaDebba> oh boy, that's another type of educational content O.o
[01/5/18, 8:06:13 AM] <Zismarith> Heh
[01/5/18, 8:06:18 AM] <talahar> loremasters would also make an excellent podcast.
[01/5/18, 8:07:14 AM] <Rasshidan> Fel could be put as CE and Void for LE.
[01/5/18, 8:07:49 AM] <aurice_heartly> has loremasters ever done the lore of Vox Machina???
[01/5/18, 8:07:58 AM] <Kol_Drake> modified HP Lovecraft critters...
[01/5/18, 8:08:05 AM] <steelneko> Are all these old gods based on Lovecraftian monsters?
[01/5/18, 8:08:07 AM] <Zismarith> C'thun Flakes. Part of this nutritious breakfast with toast, juice and milk.
[01/5/18, 8:08:11 AM] <Safdocter> @aurice_heartly that would be kool
[01/5/18, 8:08:13 AM] <Zismarith> Yes.
[01/5/18, 8:08:17 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype ramaHype x2
[01/5/18, 8:08:21 AM] <Brooster> Y'sharrj
[01/5/18, 8:08:22 AM] <ohGr> A lot of Lovecraft influence, yes
[01/5/18, 8:08:28 AM] <ohGr> they have tentacles
[01/5/18, 8:08:34 AM] <Reneliel> As Day9 says, Y-Shar-Jay! lol
[01/5/18, 8:08:36 AM] <Obito_13> @aurice_heartly No, but I don't really see why we would need it, imo.
[01/5/18, 8:08:36 AM] <Highfarm73> Fel reavers were terrifying in wow
[01/5/18, 8:08:40 AM] <Weirdz33> Cthulu F'tauguhn
[01/5/18, 8:08:45 AM] <Highfarm73> Y jar Ar jay :D
[01/5/18, 8:08:52 AM] <stargazer1977> Matt is still building his world, once he's done I have no doubts that Ryan will be interested in doing some Loremaster on it.
[01/5/18, 8:08:52 AM] <Kol_Drake> ðŸŽ¶ Under the sea.... under the sea.... ðŸŽ¶
[01/5/18, 8:09:04 AM] <talahar> i miss world of warcraft. can't play it anymore, as my main laptop died, and they changed the min sys reqs, and they won't let it run on my backup lappy
[01/5/18, 8:09:08 AM] <talahar> bastards
[01/5/18, 8:09:08 AM] <Compel_Bast> I'm kinda surprised warcraft was this complicated. Warhammer feels more straightforward compared to this, at least before "Age of Sigmar" happened
[01/5/18, 8:09:14 AM] <Ossborn> Awwwww..... thuluFAIL thuluFEELSMAN
[01/5/18, 8:09:19 AM] <Obito_13> Yea
[01/5/18, 8:09:33 AM] <Highfarm73> Reneliel haha yeah, I was trying to type how he says it
[01/5/18, 8:09:33 AM] <ohGr> funny enough the first Warcraft game (RTS) was suppose to be a Warhammer game
[01/5/18, 8:09:44 AM] <chaoticloony> hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype ramaHype
[01/5/18, 8:09:49 AM] <YebbaDebba> Tagline 'This is super nerdy, and I love it."
[01/5/18, 8:09:54 AM] <stratoria> is their critical role tonight?
[01/5/18, 8:10:03 AM] <Reneliel> @Highfarm73 it's was hilarious when I heard him say it, so it must be true =P
[01/5/18, 8:10:05 AM] <ohGr> Oh I am all about Warcraft Lore here LUL
[01/5/18, 8:10:06 AM] <stargazer1977> There is a Q&A tonight.
[01/5/18, 8:10:15 AM] <stratoria> Thanks!
[01/5/18, 8:10:17 AM] <chaoticloony> @stratoria it is a Q&A, game starts next week
[01/5/18, 8:10:20 AM] <Obito_13> @stratoria Not the beginning of the new campaign but a Q&A
[01/5/18, 8:10:25 AM] <YebbaDebba> There is! The new campaign does not start until next week but there is a Q&A @stratoria
[01/5/18, 8:10:29 AM] <stratoria> neat-o cheeto
[01/5/18, 8:10:47 AM] <SerMonstein> I am the only one more excited for this show then the CritRole QnA tonight?
[01/5/18, 8:10:48 AM] <ohGr> There was another Old God. But I'll leave it to him to talka bout if he brings it up
[01/5/18, 8:10:49 AM] <Kol_Drake> Taking the time to create a 'living game world history' allows for creative advancement AND growth instead of using a 'two line' reason for being.
[01/5/18, 8:10:50 AM] <miros7821> bow down before the god of death
[01/5/18, 8:10:50 AM] <chaoticloony> RE hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype ramaHype
[01/5/18, 8:10:51 AM] <Compel_Bast> @ohGr Yeah, from what I've been told blizzard made the game, then asked GW, who said, "err... Nope, shoulda asked us first." So they just retweaked it and created warcraft
[01/5/18, 8:11:02 AM] <Zismarith> Never did quite beat Yogg Saron's final phase.
[01/5/18, 8:11:07 AM] <ohGr> Yeah basically Comp
[01/5/18, 8:11:09 AM] <chaoticloony> hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype ramaHype !
[01/5/18, 8:11:11 AM] <YebbaDebba> not at all @sermonstein !! ::fangirl clapping::
[01/5/18, 8:11:23 AM] <Obito_13> @sermonstein Honestly no, I like Critical role, but I have other interests on the channel
[01/5/18, 8:11:26 AM] <Compel_Bast> it might have been because GW had already made a deal with the "Shadow of the Horned Rat" people
