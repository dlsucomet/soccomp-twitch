[01/6/18, 8:03:52 AM] <WhiteNekoKnight> I thought they covered the time displacement part rather well a few times. Warp doesn't cause time displacement because you remove yourself from regular space. If you traveled around at near lightspeed at impulse you would feel the effects.

[01/6/18, 8:05:33 AM] <Fu4ow> the new schedule is weird. Strange watching when it's still light out
[01/6/18, 8:05:47 AM] <Vance1982> No Aliza tonight?
[01/6/18, 8:06:03 AM] <shidareAKI> She’s going to be late

[01/6/18, 8:06:57 AM] <Chovexani> a plant shuttle? :o
[01/6/18, 8:06:58 AM] <SynapticWanderer> @swiftfingers does scruffiness affect one's ability to herd nerf?
[01/6/18, 8:07:03 AM] <JundlandBanshee> Nope
[01/6/18, 8:07:06 AM] <LibrarianLizz> she's going to be late

[01/6/18, 8:07:30 AM] <JundlandBanshee> It's a byproduct of herding nerfs
[01/6/18, 8:07:34 AM] <Vance1982> Aliza is probably stuck in LA traffic, just like Scanlan
[01/6/18, 8:07:39 AM] <Navy_DM> lego has a programmable computer for robotics

[01/6/18, 8:11:59 AM] <starpilotsix> It was a few hundred stardates?
[01/6/18, 8:12:02 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> She's invisible right now
[01/6/18, 8:12:06 AM] <Dashiva7> Maybe it has been answered, but why isn't there any shows on mondays?

[01/6/18, 8:12:40 AM] <Whirlwound> Whose is better though - Russell Watson's or Rod Stewart's?
[01/6/18, 8:12:44 AM] <starpilotsix> Looking for T'Lan when T'lan is late, is illogical.
[01/6/18, 8:12:47 AM] <Dashiva7> Thank you
[01/6/18, 8:12:48 AM] <D4N73P7> omg I just find out that this existed... hyped

[01/6/18, 8:13:09 AM] <DJPheonyx> Watson's, but Stewart's is the original
[01/6/18, 8:13:09 AM] <megjane42> previously on shield of tomorrow: sentient plans, section 13, stupid sexy zazrit, Q!, aggressive bending of starfleet rules, klingons, zombies, and asteroids.
[01/6/18, 8:13:10 AM] <chaoticloony> @D4N73P7 Glad you could join us
[01/6/18, 8:13:13 AM] <Chovexani> awww Bonnie we love you for coming to play wit us
[01/6/18, 8:13:13 AM] <EricaTheStrange> how about a high five or a fist bump or a jaunty head nod :D @gogt200
[01/6/18, 8:13:16 AM] <CiaraTheBraid> @D4N73P7 If you have the time, you might wanna try checking out the backlog of the first season <3

[01/6/18, 8:13:34 AM] <Lefty79> T'Lan is busy at work in her Science Lab, and will be on the bridge when she's done.
[01/6/18, 8:13:39 AM] <Whirlwound> Ah - even then, Watson's original, or the more acoustic one?
[01/6/18, 8:13:44 AM] <tomservo544> @chaoticloony Congrats on sword! Looks good on ya
[01/6/18, 8:13:58 AM] <gogt200> @PipersTwin I will take a jaunty head nod or cuddles with plushies! :3
[01/6/18, 8:14:02 AM] <DANfan69> Bonnie hasn't missed a show so far, although she almost missed one
[01/6/18, 8:14:07 AM] <chaoticloony> @tomservo544 Thank you.
