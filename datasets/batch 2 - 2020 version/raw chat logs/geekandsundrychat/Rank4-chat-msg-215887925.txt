[01/6/18, 12:10:43 PM] <cinphoria> I do not think giving Erika a bottle of champagne for the first time on set was a good idea.
[01/6/18, 12:10:44 PM] <PAPerryman> And the Sparkles on AKI!
[01/6/18, 12:10:45 PM] <misssunflower94> oh look at this lovely cast!

[01/6/18, 12:18:03 PM] <Shadowner> pirates at a magicians hangout
[01/6/18, 12:18:11 PM] <phoenixgoth> Naw, a bit too flamboyant for Tal, I think
[01/6/18, 12:18:12 PM] <Chovexani> Sounds pretty funny
[01/6/18, 12:18:14 PM] <phoenixgoth> the smoky gray is perfect.
[01/6/18, 12:18:18 PM] <Compel_Bast> I think I'll be the judge of whether that was funny or not
[01/6/18, 12:18:23 PM] <jesta578> Rum gets you fast :P
[01/6/18, 12:18:28 PM] <harberst> Dressed like pirates for a magicians rum tasting? Sounds about right.
[01/6/18, 12:18:30 PM] <cinphoria> The SECOND time Vince dressed like a pirate because of G&S?
[01/6/18, 12:18:33 PM] <stargazer1977> Unless Tal is dressing up as the mayor of Tucson.
[01/6/18, 12:18:35 PM] <vexelghost> Next dress as magicians on a pirate ship. :p
[01/6/18, 12:18:42 PM] <Raidrith> @misssunflower94 you think maybe all Taliesin's bling is in his goth wardrobe?
[01/6/18, 12:18:47 PM] <Zismarith> AKI watch out, Vince kisses everyone! Have clips!
[01/6/18, 12:18:49 PM] <pagegirl34> as always Taliesin and Erika look wondeful, I am dazzled by tye beauty of this party
