[01/10/18, 8:01:03 AM] <stargazer1977> I finished off Xenoblade Chronicles 2, got all 38 blades, maxxed out all their skill trees, finished every side quest in the game, and defeated all the Superbosses in the post game. My save file is 491 hours. T.T
[01/10/18, 8:01:12 AM] <Smallish_Sam> Going to be playing Breath of the Wild as I watch this

[01/10/18, 8:01:31 AM] <BenLewis> Damn bruh! Iâ€™m still trying to push through Xenoblade. Been mostly playing Fire Emblem.

[01/10/18, 8:01:49 AM] <Andyinsomnia> the awesome twins
[01/10/18, 8:01:51 AM] <stargazer1977> Other than that, I just reviewed an indie game, and played through a press preview build on an indie sidescrolling brawler called "Way of the Passive Fist".
[01/10/18, 8:02:04 AM] <Zismarith> 99% no-fall rate!!
[01/10/18, 8:02:04 AM] <JeffM0307> Almost...ask Troy Baker
[01/10/18, 8:02:17 AM] <Andyinsomnia> It certainly never falls on major Voice Actors. Nope.
[01/10/18, 8:02:35 AM] <autisticcosplay> great music all!
[01/10/18, 8:02:36 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry We missed you all!!!!!

[01/10/18, 8:03:00 AM] <BenLewis> Itâ€™s so cold and it barely snowed. Crikey.
[01/10/18, 8:03:15 AM] <Compel_Bast> OMG its... Firefoxx!

[01/10/18, 8:04:19 AM] <BenLewis> Theyâ€™re very aggressive online with most games, lol.
[01/10/18, 8:04:43 AM] <Critternation3000> definitely spelt that wrong ramaFacepalm
[01/10/18, 8:04:48 AM] <Zismarith> Free is not the reason Getting Over It is not a good holiday gift . . . for family you LIKE.

[01/10/18, 8:06:16 AM] <Nightbot> Erika Ishii ( twitter.com/erikaishii ), and OMGitsfirefoxx ( twitter.com/OMGitsfirefoxx ).
[01/10/18, 8:06:18 AM] <PSWii2008> attkEddie Dabs for Sonja! attkEddie
[01/10/18, 8:06:19 AM] <Critternation3000> @chix_with_joystix feliciaYEAH
[01/10/18, 8:06:21 AM] <Zismarith> Before 2019!
[01/10/18, 8:06:24 AM] <Compel_Bast> The one thing I found weird with it was the ending was ridiculously short after all that.
[01/10/18, 8:06:27 AM] <stargazer1977> @Chix_with_Joystix well, try not to bean her with the set then. ;)

[01/10/18, 8:07:29 AM] <Compel_Bast> Reading a chat of that size is extremely difficult too...
[01/10/18, 8:07:31 AM] <Zismarith> 113,066 at the moment.
[01/10/18, 8:07:44 AM] <TheMellowDeviant> @Critternation3000 ohay boo attkAlex
[01/10/18, 8:07:56 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> $5 troll toll
[01/10/18, 8:07:57 AM] <Mr_Lemur_> what site they streaming on with all these viewers?
[01/10/18, 8:08:08 AM] <starpilotsix> Remember how much people gave to make you eat a spider. Some people will absolutely donate just to be negative. ;)
[01/10/18, 8:08:21 AM] <Shadowner> heck 30-50k for CritRole is hard
[01/10/18, 8:08:21 AM] <phirexZ> i subbed just so i could spam chat with memes
[01/10/18, 8:08:29 AM] <Teh_Weltschmerz> 1000k viewership is like a dinner bell for trolls. The sub only chat was a good idea.
[01/10/18, 8:08:33 AM] <Andyinsomnia> charging to talk in chat sounds bad but honestly at that size talking in chat is essentially impossible anyway and the money goes to charity
[01/10/18, 8:08:37 AM] <Critternation3000> @starpilotsix well played
[01/10/18, 8:08:42 AM] <FuffyButt> chat is always good, i will not have dismay the honorable name of chat
[01/10/18, 8:09:00 AM] <Fu4ow> as well, anyone can host and chat on the hosted channel
[01/10/18, 8:09:06 AM] <Fu4ow> or in other services
[01/10/18, 8:09:11 AM] <Trophyscars89> hola all!
[01/10/18, 8:09:30 AM] <Andyinsomnia> OK 5 seconds in and I'm sold
[01/10/18, 8:09:35 AM] <boss_nova_ice> what is sonja doing in a gamming show ?
[01/10/18, 8:09:38 AM] <Fu4ow> looks very VVVVVV
[01/10/18, 8:09:39 AM] <Stringer2355> i thought Austin Wintry was going to be on ?
[01/10/18, 8:09:40 AM] <BenLewis> I think they should keep the Â£5 toll. Itâ€™s not much and it helps with moderation. Plus it goes to charity.
[01/10/18, 8:09:44 AM] <Ossborn> ThatÂ´s the one thing which made me stop watzching Toitalbiscuit... his chat was always subscriber only, 100% of the time... didnt like itz, never returned after watcching it for2-3 days
[01/10/18, 8:09:44 AM] <Compel_Bast> reminds me of Speedrunners
[01/10/18, 8:10:01 AM] <stargazer1977> I play a lot of platformers, but I also review a lot of indie games. And platformers are very popular in the indie side of the industry.
[01/10/18, 8:10:03 AM] <jarradheath> hey
[01/10/18, 8:10:09 AM] <ghosthack159> omg, games I cant play! yay
[01/10/18, 8:10:18 AM] <Ossborn> Argh.... why do I keep hitting the z after typing a t?
[01/10/18, 8:10:18 AM] <ghosthack159> also, hey-yall
[01/10/18, 8:10:35 AM] <YebbaDebba> good afternoon @ghosthack159 !!
[01/10/18, 8:10:41 AM] <Fu4ow> @Stringer2355 guest segment is later on
[01/10/18, 8:10:44 AM] <Trophyscars89> is there a new Talks Machina on tonight?
[01/10/18, 8:10:48 AM] <postdataest> From the Geek and Sundry twitter >>> ..there will be NO #TalksMachina Tuesday night as the crew runs some state-of-the-art tests for this Thursday's big campaign kick-off on #CriticalRole.
[01/10/18, 8:10:53 AM] <ghosthack159> *shaka* sup brah
[01/10/18, 8:11:07 AM] <Trophyscars89> :)
[01/10/18, 8:11:08 AM] <Shadowner> crypt of the necrodancer was a nice rhythm style game
[01/10/18, 8:11:18 AM] <Stringer2355> thank you Fu4ow
[01/10/18, 8:11:32 AM] <Critternation3000> ask Sonja what it was like to act with the Rock?
[01/10/18, 8:11:35 AM] <ghosthack159> Erika, I do love indy platformers... but I'm over the 8-bit
[01/10/18, 8:11:38 AM] <EmxLBJ> I don
[01/10/18, 8:11:42 AM] <stargazer1977> Looks good, but I won't play it coop. Interesting concept though.
[01/10/18, 8:11:54 AM] <BenLewis> 8bit games were the best.
[01/10/18, 8:11:59 AM] <ponts777> what was the name of the cute game?
[01/10/18, 8:12:06 AM] <ghosthack159> 16 or 24 would be fine.... but the super nostalgia... isnt super nostalgiac for me :-/
[01/10/18, 8:12:09 AM] <BenLewis> Something kinda like Undertale in a sense yeah?
[01/10/18, 8:12:27 AM] <hiatusOW> OMEGALUL in the chat BOIS
[01/10/18, 8:12:43 AM] <EmxLBJ> 2018 and new Erika content is pretty much all I need this year. This girl is a star!
[01/10/18, 8:12:45 AM] <MadBraxGaming97> So what is this that I'm watching?
[01/10/18, 8:12:51 AM] <Ossborn> As long as the standard version finally gets affordable
[01/10/18, 8:12:56 AM] <ghosthack159> so... not a Vibe wireless adaptor...
[01/10/18, 8:13:02 AM] <postdataest> !wtfisthis
[01/10/18, 8:13:03 AM] <Nightbot> Welcome to #GameEngine! We'll be discussing the latest gaming news, showcasing new games, and interviewing people in the gaming industry!
[01/10/18, 8:13:24 AM] <Andyinsomnia> But without wires what will stop the destruction when Erika is spooped and throws the headset?
[01/10/18, 8:13:37 AM] <Simienne> lol
[01/10/18, 8:13:39 AM] <ghosthack159> Well SOME dog leashes... but, you know, not VR
[01/10/18, 8:13:39 AM] <BenLewis> Itâ€™s definitely gonna be expensive, LOL.
[01/10/18, 8:13:41 AM] <consuela3> Erika unleashed!
[01/10/18, 8:13:48 AM] <Zismarith> The pulleys have already saved the Vive a couple of times. Don't knock the pulleys!
[01/10/18, 8:13:56 AM] <FuffyButt> i was promised bells and whistles, i have heard no bells and have seen no whistles
[01/10/18, 8:13:58 AM] <BenLewis> Thatâ€™s gonna be like Â£800
[01/10/18, 8:14:39 AM] <stargazer1977> That sounds nice... until Erika plays a game like P.T. in AR.
[01/10/18, 8:14:44 AM] <LizForkin> They loves that VR
[01/10/18, 8:14:50 AM] <starpilotsix> You could try padding everything in the room
[01/10/18, 8:14:57 AM] <JeffM0307> Oh, yeah. Classic.
[01/10/18, 8:15:01 AM] <Paladin356> theres a youtube video of it
[01/10/18, 8:15:02 AM] <consuela3> needs the wiimote wrist strap
[01/10/18, 8:15:04 AM] <Compel_Bast> power pack in a belt? Best of both?
[01/10/18, 8:15:06 AM] <YebbaDebba> Velcro gloves so it just stays on your hands instead of going flying?
