[01/11/18, 11:07:03 AM] <LawsOnMe> The first letter that I ever wrote for a comics letter column was for Y: The Last Man. That series made me fall in love with the medium's storytelling possibilities.
[01/11/18, 11:07:05 AM] <Vance1982> Amy's enthusiasm is contagious
[01/11/18, 11:07:16 AM] <cinphoria> oh wow, that's amazing
