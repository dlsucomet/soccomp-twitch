[01/12/18, 8:00:20 AM] ** shidareAKI General note to all: PLEASE do not troll/tease people coming in to ask about Critical Role by saying things like "it's cancelled". You may mean it all in good fun, but this adds unnecessary confusion to the chat that makes it more difficult to dispense information.
[01/12/18, 8:00:23 AM] <RedCyclone84> @gangrenedollie thx I'll look into it, I think I'm reluctant because creature of habit and all that, but I will look into it. Do you recommend a certain way to go about it for someone new?

[01/12/18, 8:06:22 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I've heard a fair bit about this game, but it is a shame it was a XBOX exclusive.
[01/12/18, 8:06:23 AM] <GambiteMii> I want it to be 7pm PST now XD
[01/12/18, 8:06:25 AM] <Rozmere> @Leigh574 Oh No! That's scary, I'll reload

[01/12/18, 8:07:02 AM] <oCARRIONo> I haven't heard anyone talk about this before. I played it when I was in Jr. High or something and it blew my mind.
[01/12/18, 8:07:02 AM] <darKneXus23> i hope i can stay awake, 4am will be hard

[01/12/18, 8:07:17 AM] <MorgyD94> My clock was wrong not my math..surprisingly XD
[01/12/18, 8:07:17 AM] <chaoticloony> @Explode0matic CR brings the people in, but the other shows are also great
[01/12/18, 8:07:18 AM] <TFm8> Very true :)

[01/12/18, 8:07:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi Selina
[01/12/18, 8:07:28 AM] <slown137> it sounds fine to me
[01/12/18, 8:07:33 AM] <vexelghost> Never heard of Breakdown but your description sounds cool. I prefer proper first person gameplay that shows the hands doing everything. Much more immersive IMO.
[01/12/18, 8:07:35 AM] <Earthex4> When is CR boys ?
[01/12/18, 8:07:36 AM] <RiskyPixels> oh hey, that's Selina!
