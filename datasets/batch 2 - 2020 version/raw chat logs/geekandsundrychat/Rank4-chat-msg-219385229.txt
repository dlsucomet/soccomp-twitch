[01/17/18, 8:11:09 AM] <stargazer1977> Yes, he's at fault, but so is the US issue of police being militarized and shooting to kill in so many situations that it does not require it.

[01/17/18, 8:11:13 AM] <ghosthack159> it's a terrible thing to DO, and it was only a matter of time, before it went too far.

[01/17/18, 8:11:31 AM] <KingSundew> agreed @stargazer1977
[01/17/18, 8:11:33 AM] <MrNY2Cali> and swatting is 100x worse in the EU were its more popular
[01/17/18, 8:11:35 AM] <clancywonk> @critternation3000 I don't understand, but man I hope so
[01/17/18, 8:11:39 AM] <polarizingfold> @stargazer1977 Totally agree
[01/17/18, 8:11:43 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Its important to remember that altho this is the first human to be killed by Swatting there have also been many pets killed because of it
[01/17/18, 8:11:45 AM] <GamerBadger82> Yeah the American police seem very trigger happy so very dangerous
[01/17/18, 8:12:00 AM] <KBTibbs> oh, there's no chance the Cop will be punished in any way.
[01/17/18, 8:12:00 AM] <stargazer1977> This person also swatted a Canadian, that person did not get shot.

[01/17/18, 8:12:04 AM] <clancywonk> It's kind of a problem
[01/17/18, 8:12:19 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> U.S. police are SUPER trigger happy, they are trained that way with almost no de-escalation training.@GamerBadger82
[01/17/18, 8:12:23 AM] <GayBowtie> n
[01/17/18, 8:12:36 AM] <WeedVR> It doesn't matter, they have to come anyway.
[01/17/18, 8:12:53 AM] <WeedVR> They will always show up, but just not guns drawn.

[01/17/18, 8:13:25 AM] <byronburgerbarn> swatting is disgusting
[01/17/18, 8:13:25 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @Jim They're still trained for maximum force, shoot first. The raids used to be a few hundred a year. Now it's like 55,000+ annually.
