[01/18/18, 11:10:06 AM] <rasnac_khan> QUESTİON: Which of his many masterpieces is Alan Moore's magnum opus in your opinion, excluding Watchmen? I nominate The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
[01/18/18, 11:10:10 AM] <Salbastro> I played one D&D game with frankie. They were great
[01/18/18, 11:10:16 AM] <japenrose> There is a reason we have that long title for our reading group
[01/18/18, 11:10:18 AM] <rasnac_khan> Grant Morrison is discount Alan moore at best.
[01/18/18, 11:10:22 AM] <LizForkin> Tal and I have talked about Alan Moore so much. I'm excited for this one

[01/18/18, 11:10:39 AM] <stargazer1977> QUESTION: While I do love Alan Moore's more popular works like Watchmen and V, I actually love him best when he challenges in works like Promethea and Lost Girls. They aren't for everyone, but for the right person they are revolutionary. What is your opinion on art that pokes and prods and possibly even offends people?
[01/18/18, 11:10:40 AM] <creatorswhim> his hands always shake
