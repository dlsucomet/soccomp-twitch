[01/18/18, 1:43:36 PM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> safety dance involve holding a knife in one hand and scissors in the other hand, yes?
[01/18/18, 1:43:37 PM] <Slippydude> @rasnac_khan I brought this up last week, I am still not entirely convinced he did
[01/18/18, 1:43:40 PM] <cinphoria> !wtfisthis
[01/18/18, 1:43:40 PM] <Nightbot> This is Mines 'n' Crafts where Amy, Stef, and Gina do crafts and play Minecraft on the Sundrycraft server.
[01/18/18, 1:43:45 PM] <CelestialChickin> Hiiiiiiiiiii
[01/18/18, 1:43:50 PM] <stargazer1977> They really should have made Clue instead. The hint is Stef in the Studio with the Hammer.
[01/18/18, 1:43:53 PM] <cinphoria> hey spacebirb
[01/18/18, 1:44:05 PM] <yapyap92> hey @CelestialChickin
[01/18/18, 1:44:06 PM] <PFWScott> So we have paper, scissors...where's the rock?
[01/18/18, 1:44:10 PM] <Zismarith> Amy, with the scissors, in the studio.
[01/18/18, 1:44:11 PM] <LevDa> hammer: roll a saving throw to send someone to Seattle.
[01/18/18, 1:44:15 PM] <reverseaquamath> ....we need to make a GnS version of Clue now
[01/18/18, 1:44:16 PM] <chaoticloony> Hammer usually beats scissors!

[01/18/18, 1:44:24 PM] <Weelyfactoids> im imaging amy throwing the scissors at stef trying to send her to seattle
[01/18/18, 1:44:32 PM] <PFWScott> We couldn't see it, don't worry.
[01/18/18, 1:44:34 PM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> maybe the hammer will do @PFWScott
[01/18/18, 1:44:36 PM] <cabezadecervez> play a round of scissors hammer superglue
[01/18/18, 1:44:39 PM] <The33rd> If you make a Cluedo game with GnS, it's always Stef the murderess?
[01/18/18, 1:44:41 PM] <rasnac_khan> @Slippydude someone should ask Gina a question only Gina would know, to make sure.
[01/18/18, 1:44:41 PM] <JeffM0307> We didn't see a thing
[01/18/18, 1:44:42 PM] <PFWScott> It's too light to show on camera.
[01/18/18, 1:44:43 PM] <zathyr> That's the problem with a G&S Clue - it'd always be Stef ;)
