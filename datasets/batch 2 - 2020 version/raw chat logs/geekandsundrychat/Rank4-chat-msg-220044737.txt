[01/19/18, 9:41:55 AM] <down2chill> $1 dollar Bob
[01/19/18, 9:41:55 AM] ** ravensburgermaster I'm a Nintendo loyalist, and this is bullshit and overpriced
[01/19/18, 9:41:56 AM] <FluxElectro> We will definitely see many rip offs of these designs in the market afters
[01/19/18, 9:41:57 AM] <AngryDraco> Recycled unsold Wii U boxes, gotta make back those lost profits
[01/19/18, 9:42:00 AM] <DeusVenandi> For $69.99 you can enjoy all these gaming cardboards. and when you need to move out, you got all these boxes for free
[01/19/18, 9:42:04 AM] <Buford_Tea> anyone who has kids knows they will get 2 weekends of entertainment out of it before losing interest or it getting destroyed
[01/19/18, 9:42:04 AM] <vexelghost> It's clever augmented reality but overpriced.
[01/19/18, 9:42:05 AM] <XvShadow> $70?! D:
[01/19/18, 9:42:07 AM] <rhyatt63> Ok, so far we have 420 and $69. Nintendo is run by teenage stoners.
[01/19/18, 9:42:11 AM] <tomservo544> I’m guessing there must have been an update to the twitch mobile app.
[01/19/18, 9:42:11 AM] <Taurolyon> Should be $3
[01/19/18, 9:42:14 AM] <gaywormdog> 70 is as much as a lot of other AAA games...
[01/19/18, 9:42:16 AM] <XvShadow> mikebWTF
[01/19/18, 9:42:19 AM] <smalls____> LOL it a piece of cardboard
[01/19/18, 9:42:19 AM] <UndeadIrishGuy> 70 bucks... for cardboard people!?
[01/19/18, 9:42:20 AM] <brecreep> More like $10 for some bloody cardboard
[01/19/18, 9:42:23 AM] <VermillionCrimson> $70 for some precut cardboard? That's a fucking steal.
[01/19/18, 9:42:24 AM] <ghosthack159> It's completely consumerist and disposable.. you're gonna break that shit in like 4 hours and if you LIKE it, you'll have to buy more cardboard.
[01/19/18, 9:42:24 AM] <IcyWidowMaker> did i miss crit role?
[01/19/18, 9:42:26 AM] <TimesNewPwnin> it's expensive because it comes with games
[01/19/18, 9:42:27 AM] <FluxElectro> They should make it cheaper so people won't get the rip offs
[01/19/18, 9:42:28 AM] <TimesNewPwnin> not just cardbnoard
[01/19/18, 9:42:30 AM] <Rogues4Ever> exactly
[01/19/18, 9:42:30 AM] <KororoX> doesn't the 70 bucks include the game?
[01/19/18, 9:42:32 AM] <pSkinner> its BLOODY PAPER
[01/19/18, 9:42:33 AM] <FerosR1> even if it gets wrecked you can always just grab any cardboard box and cut out the shapes
[01/19/18, 9:42:33 AM] <NeonDeflector> 70 dollars for something that can be destroyed by a glass of water.....

[01/19/18, 9:43:14 AM] <MisterLoggans> so, 9 dollars?
[01/19/18, 9:43:20 AM] <DeusVenandi> it's finally thursday gandsSCANLAN
[01/19/18, 9:43:20 AM] <MasterSteel> cant you just watch that video and makeyour own cardboard keyboard?
[01/19/18, 9:43:27 AM] <APhanpy> Yeah it's like amazon already gives me more cardboard than I want
[01/19/18, 9:43:31 AM] <Jeebs92> its the game and the cardboard
[01/19/18, 9:43:39 AM] <DoOrDoNotThereIsNoTry> btw ...thank you to who ever decided to you tube live last weeks eoisode. awesome idea.
[01/19/18, 9:43:43 AM] <Rogues4Ever> why they not just sell the plans for cheap then you can get your own cardboard
[01/19/18, 9:43:43 AM] <MrFitz8897> the switch is great
[01/19/18, 9:43:47 AM] <OSpecterO> CR starts in like 20 mins right?
[01/19/18, 9:43:49 AM] <ImmatureRAGE> This is ep 2 of the new campaign right not ep 3?
[01/19/18, 9:43:50 AM] <EmxLBJ> The mind blowing part is could you imagine Nintendo's margins? They are probably spending 1.50$ to make it and selling it for 70.
[01/19/18, 9:43:51 AM] <ravensburgermaster> do they ship the cardboard in cardboard?
[01/19/18, 9:43:51 AM] <VermillionCrimson> You would could order a switch and the game and have enough cardboard to do everything.
[01/19/18, 9:43:57 AM] <MrFitz8897> !wheniscr
[01/19/18, 9:43:57 AM] <pSkinner> Cardboard for $70 thats how dumb we are now
[01/19/18, 9:43:59 AM] <Andyinsomnia> http://www.wheniscriticalrole.com/ <<< Countdown clock for live Critical Role.
[01/19/18, 9:44:01 AM] <kanakothesquirrel> Nintendo has said they will replace broken cardboard at no cost to us
[01/19/18, 9:44:01 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> micro transactions or petroleum products? that is a legit hard decision
[01/19/18, 9:44:02 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @ImmatureRAGE Yes.
[01/19/18, 9:44:03 AM] <GrandeurTheGrandest> Too bad the accessories are fuggin' expensive though D:
[01/19/18, 9:44:07 AM] <AngryDraco> Opening up IP's,,,,, and keeping their cardboard box
[01/19/18, 9:44:08 AM] <tomservo544> SNES is my favorite
[01/19/18, 9:44:11 AM] <ravenknightWWE> what time does Critical Role start?
[01/19/18, 9:44:15 AM] <walkietalkierobot> The game is next to the cardboard in the marketing, so I assume you’re paying $50-60 for the game and $10-20 for the cardboard.
[01/19/18, 9:44:17 AM] <OSpecterO> K thx
[01/19/18, 9:44:18 AM] <Planeswalkerpt> New switch games go for $60 usually so the cardboard accessories are actually decently priced
[01/19/18, 9:44:19 AM] <ImmatureRAGE> @VermillionCrimson bless ya
[01/19/18, 9:44:20 AM] <tomservo544> But I can’t wait to get a switch
[01/19/18, 9:44:23 AM] <PerthTegan> the only thing I want from Nintendo is a new Animal Crossing
[01/19/18, 9:44:28 AM] <VermillionCrimson> That foot pedal is gonna be the first thing to go.
[01/19/18, 9:44:29 AM] <TimesNewPwnin> @isaidnothankyou exactly
[01/19/18, 9:44:29 AM] <TrueBalance> $70 for a game fully developed...those bitches wanting to get paid for a new idea.
[01/19/18, 9:44:38 AM] <Rogues4Ever> it's JANK
[01/19/18, 9:44:41 AM] <KororoX> the 70$ version includes the game, so still expensive but not that much
