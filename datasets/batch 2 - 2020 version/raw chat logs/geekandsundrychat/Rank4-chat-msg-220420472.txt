[01/20/18, 12:18:17 PM] <ShoraiKiri> Josephine said she was going to a birthday party tonight? Is she gonna be here or is that something else?

[01/20/18, 12:19:47 PM] <VexedAndPerplexed> I'm making tea in about an hour because I'm lazy
[01/20/18, 12:19:47 PM] <Chovexani> they're so pretty but.. I question the tastiness?

[01/20/18, 12:19:57 PM] <stargazer1977> It's okay, Stevie, you are among nerdy friends. If I tell people half of my previous jobs or research projects their eyes just glaze over.
[01/20/18, 12:19:58 PM] <Critternation3000> what is that another spider?

[01/20/18, 12:21:30 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> When in Faerie or in Wonderland, never, not EVER, eat or Drink ANYTHING @Danoba -- so you be careful over in your little nook my man :)
[01/20/18, 12:21:31 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> @cinphoria that might turn out worse than when The Flash took Blue Paridise in the older tv show
[01/20/18, 12:21:35 PM] <acsylia> welp christmas tea it is :D
