[01/25/18, 11:06:56 AM] <The_TBoyce> "House of Demons", aka "The Residence of Taliesin Jaffe". LOL
[01/25/18, 11:06:57 AM] <harberst> Amy is on this show, we're used to someone randomly yelling into a mic. :P
[01/25/18, 11:06:59 AM] <sirfalsedawn> I feel that 'Age of Apocalypse' should get mentioned this episode.
[01/25/18, 11:07:00 AM] <cinphoria> This is, obviously, a HORROR MOVIE
[01/25/18, 11:07:02 AM] <meaningofnightt> Whitney may have made a whole show on how metal the post apocalyse is
[01/25/18, 11:07:05 AM] <SombreSavant3> @japenrose thanks

[01/25/18, 11:07:12 AM] <The_TBoyce> QUESTION for Taliesin: Which Ren Faire people am I most likely to encounter in the post-apocalypse? Is it the Jousters? It's the Jousters, isn't it?
[01/25/18, 11:07:19 AM] <rasnac_khan> Whitney is the best! :)

[01/25/18, 11:07:32 AM] <Barbadikus> I liked thrashtopia.. not sure why but I liked it.
[01/25/18, 11:07:35 AM] <nocluehowtodoit> Wait, Taliesin appears in actual films? I thought he gave that up for voice acting only
[01/25/18, 11:07:41 AM] <cinphoria> @japenrose I've been following it and waiting for release news for MONTHS xD It looks so good
[01/25/18, 11:07:43 AM] <ToonEzon> um ok i am loving taliesins hair, with this lighting we can actually see it in all its blue glory

[01/25/18, 11:07:59 AM] <Losile> Thrashtopia was suuuuuuch a good weird brain reset
[01/25/18, 11:07:59 AM] <halfaringcircus> Thrashtopia is so fun. And continuing storyline was genuinely surprising.
[01/25/18, 11:08:00 AM] <Critternation3000> we always need moore of Whitney
[01/25/18, 11:08:00 AM] <japenrose> @The_TBoyce Star Wars film comes out in May!
[01/25/18, 11:08:01 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL
[01/25/18, 11:08:02 AM] <ToonEzon> what's tonight's topic?
[01/25/18, 11:08:04 AM] <misssunflower94> Whitney's post-apocalyptic!Playhouse
[01/25/18, 11:08:06 AM] <japenrose> @cinphoria What?!? Oh man
[01/25/18, 11:08:09 AM] <cinphoria> RIGHT??
[01/25/18, 11:08:09 AM] <phoenixgoth> "I may lick things" - Taliesin Jaffe, 2018
[01/25/18, 11:08:11 AM] <philbe63> He was on an episode
[01/25/18, 11:08:15 AM] <NeverwinterFool> The ending of Thrashtopia got dark. :D
[01/25/18, 11:08:18 AM] <The_TBoyce> @japenrose I mean Episode IX.
[01/25/18, 11:08:19 AM] <japenrose> I NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT IS PLAYING
[01/25/18, 11:08:27 AM] <japenrose> @The_TBoyce Ahhh, gotcha
[01/25/18, 11:08:27 AM] <SirABC> @chaoticloony I'm of the chaotic persuasion too, good or bad I can't decide. Neutral maybe? :D
[01/25/18, 11:08:30 AM] <rasnac_khan> Evil Whitney!!!! :S
[01/25/18, 11:08:34 AM] <Losile> YES end of Thrashtopia was jarringly wonderful
[01/25/18, 11:08:38 AM] <GuruMat> This episode fits perfectly as I am watching it whilst playing Fallout
[01/25/18, 11:08:38 AM] <cinphoria> Bad Whitney is my inner child
[01/25/18, 11:08:39 AM] <UniqTechniq> stefFremen
[01/25/18, 11:08:41 AM] <Smarcey> Tal is the heir to the goblin kings throne @GeekandSundry All hail the king
[01/25/18, 11:08:47 AM] <The_TBoyce> I would totally team up with Taliesin to survive the apocalypse. He has a kit for that.
[01/25/18, 11:08:48 AM] <RatherWT> Is Bad Whitney Bad, or is Whitney Bad Whitney?
[01/25/18, 11:08:50 AM] <vexelghost> QUESTION: What's the secret word for today?
[01/25/18, 11:08:51 AM] <super390> I play all the characters, who all kill each other.
[01/25/18, 11:08:52 AM] <chaoticloony> Alpha didn't have much when i checked it out, but that was when it started
[01/25/18, 11:08:55 AM] <ToonEzon> is the topic post apocalypse, or elseworld?
[01/25/18, 11:09:01 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype
[01/25/18, 11:09:03 AM] <misssunflower94> I would WEAR that pin
[01/25/18, 11:09:06 AM] <EmxLBJ> The fact Whitney isn't sitting at a table at the SAGS or EMMYS by now is a travesty.
[01/25/18, 11:09:06 AM] <phoenixgoth> Niiiiiice
[01/25/18, 11:09:12 AM] <lord_briarwood93> cheer100 Taliesin's Hari :O

[01/25/18, 11:09:21 AM] <The_TBoyce> "Somebody STOP Me"? Now I want to see Whitney is a comical yellow zoot suit.
[01/25/18, 11:09:22 AM] <phoenixgoth> I loved the Mask cartoon series!
[01/25/18, 11:09:26 AM] <JeffM0307> Adulting in the Apocalypse segments are being shown during the break on "Critical Role"
[01/25/18, 11:09:31 AM] <super390> The Golden Age of Dark Horse Comics titles being adapted into movies.
[01/25/18, 11:09:37 AM] <NeverwinterFool> I wish I lived in LA, all these cool movies never make it out to Philly. :(
[01/25/18, 11:09:40 AM] <The_TBoyce> The Mask comics are SO violent!
[01/25/18, 11:09:41 AM] <japenrose> @JeffM0307 I love those segments, so much
[01/25/18, 11:09:41 AM] <misssunflower94> EVERYONE should have seen the Mask
[01/25/18, 11:09:43 AM] <misssunflower94> everyone

[01/25/18, 11:10:24 AM] <derixyleth> But nobody should watch the Son of the Mask or whatever they called that garbage pile.
[01/25/18, 11:10:28 AM] <gaerfindel1> @toonezon yup!!!
[01/25/18, 11:10:31 AM] <PrimroseFrost> @misssunflower94 I wasn't allowed to watch it as a kid, then caught ~15 minutes at a friend's house, and decided I didn't care at all. *shrugs*
[01/25/18, 11:10:32 AM] <chiplickin> YUS
[01/25/18, 11:10:32 AM] <EmxLBJ> Wait... isn't Whitney wearing the exact outfit from Cameron Diaz in the Mask?
[01/25/18, 11:10:35 AM] <phoenixgoth> OOOF

[01/25/18, 11:10:39 AM] <The_TBoyce> No offense to Taliesin, but I think Jesse had the most legendary cameo on "Thrashtopia". LOL
[01/25/18, 11:10:40 AM] <ToonEzon> ugh i haven't watched that movie in For- Eh-Var
[01/25/18, 11:10:43 AM] <cinphoria> Taliesin, meanie :P

[01/25/18, 11:11:48 AM] <cinphoria> @artistsomeday settle
[01/25/18, 11:11:53 AM] <igilboa1> Taliesin is already the evil goth version. Maliesin only wears khakis and polo shirts.
