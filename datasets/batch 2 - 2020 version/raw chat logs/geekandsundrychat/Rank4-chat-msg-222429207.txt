[01/26/18, 8:03:33 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I kinda stopped watching Doctor Who pretty much after Rory and Amy "left". It just kinda got stale after that. Still, I did enjoy the show for the most part. Van Gogh always remains one of my personal favorites.
[01/26/18, 8:03:35 AM] <aurice_heartly> OOOOHHHH Satine

[01/26/18, 8:07:21 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @talahar that would be Internet Sensation Amy Dallen as that particular Doctor
[01/26/18, 8:07:30 AM] <Chovexani> I mean like i knew Sat was cool but now she's just the dopeness
[01/26/18, 8:07:32 AM] <Bazag> heya
[01/26/18, 8:07:36 AM] <vexelghost> Growing up I was afraid of the theme song so I didn't really get into it until the newer seasons.
[01/26/18, 8:07:37 AM] <Saraphys> @Danoba You are right to be in awe of my foreknoledge of the future... like what happened in Critical Role yesterday...OMG! Just wait! :D LOL
[01/26/18, 8:07:43 AM] <radarhere> Okay, this episode of Loremasters will take 26 years. And then we'll have finished the old series

[01/26/18, 8:08:13 AM] <chaoticloony> @TerrorCast I know, because most of them were so good
[01/26/18, 8:08:17 AM] <Danoba> @Saraphys Oh wow, I can't wait, I bet it was awesome.

[01/26/18, 8:08:47 AM] <Ossborn> 2ish years ago, I started to watch the clöassic seasons, but didnt get past the 3rd, as there were so many of thge lost episodes and it was exhausting to watch them (they found a solution with still images from other episodes and the full audiotrack)

[01/26/18, 8:09:21 AM] <starpilotsix> And to be fair, it was intended as a kid's show.
