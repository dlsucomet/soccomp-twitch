[01/31/18, 1:03:57 PM] <Nightbot> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.

[01/31/18, 1:05:39 PM] <grogthevictorious> I have a thought: if those in the scene are facing the crowd and all the “behind the scenes” work is being done IN FRONT of the stars... then shouldn’t the term be “in front of the scenes”???
[01/31/18, 1:05:41 PM] <Raidrith> It's the one they've used for the past few episodes @PauladinWon
