[02/1/18, 11:06:38 AM] <crthemighty> there's always something useless to get scandalized about. saves you the trouble of being scandalized about actual problems
[02/1/18, 11:06:38 AM] <stargazer1977> Here is something interesting, the censorship of books was a major thing until the mid 1930's until "Ulysses" successfully fought it, then Motion Picture Production Code censored movies from the mid 1930's until the mid 1950's. After that the Comics Code censored Comic Books until recently. The moral outrage continued switching targets until successfully fought against and then moved on to another target.
[02/1/18, 11:06:45 AM] <japenrose> My dad has told me about some of the really intense and "grotesque" books he saw as a kid in the 40s
[02/1/18, 11:06:48 AM] <halfaringcircus> I do love a good bibliography...
[02/1/18, 11:06:48 AM] <super390> @SprlngheelJack Larry Niven wrote a satirical science article about that very subject once - "Man of Steel, Woman of Tissue Paper."

[02/1/18, 11:07:46 AM] <RuzgofDI> @101deadpool1017 Point taken. The internet is evil

[02/1/18, 11:07:53 AM] <Darkelven00> I am starting a MORAL PANIC in connection with GEEK & SUNDRY for destroying the moral fiber of our society! Just look at that blue hair! It's BLUE!
[02/1/18, 11:07:56 AM] <FuffyButt> i am not evil. i was drawn that way
[02/1/18, 11:07:58 AM] <ERNesbitt> A-freakin'-men, Tal!
[02/1/18, 11:08:01 AM] <zathyr> I mean, Lobster Stick to Magnet was pretty brilliant.
[02/1/18, 11:08:01 AM] <adventuresofTONI> preach, tal!
[02/1/18, 11:08:06 AM] <artistsomeday> I shall now attempt to write a paper while listening to the Wednesday club
[02/1/18, 11:08:07 AM] <kadosho> Comics have changed a ton over time
[02/1/18, 11:08:08 AM] <Nessazorro123> True, true
[02/1/18, 11:08:08 AM] <wildbronco38> Not to mention, novels in the 1700's "reading mania"
[02/1/18, 11:08:14 AM] <PinkRanger33> gandsLessthanthree
[02/1/18, 11:08:14 AM] <phoenixgoth> Absolutely agreed, Tal
[02/1/18, 11:08:14 AM] <SaraSews> they moral panic'd novels and bicycles too
[02/1/18, 11:08:15 AM] <KBTibbs> @VermillionCrimson Refugees?
[02/1/18, 11:08:20 AM] <super390> @stargazer1977 This is reminiscent of how "native-born" Americans demonized alcohol, the "immigrant" drug, via Prohibition, until it collapsed during the Depression. Only 3 years later, marijuana, then viewed as the "black" drug, was banned instead.
[02/1/18, 11:08:21 AM] <pagegirl34> hello all
[02/1/18, 11:08:33 AM] <AromiaFlyce> im paying so much attention I almost drank my salsa
[02/1/18, 11:08:37 AM] <LittleMissKillerBanana> In the late 1940s Superman helped reduce the KKK numbers substantially
[02/1/18, 11:08:40 AM] <mathemagician_> @Darkelven00 I mean they talk about comics and play d&d on the internet. It must be evil
[02/1/18, 11:08:43 AM] <stargazer1977> @super390 indeed
[02/1/18, 11:08:44 AM] <chaoticloony> hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype
[02/1/18, 11:08:46 AM] <vexelghost> The internet isn't evil, we just have too many monkeys on typewriters now hoping to recreate Shakespeare. Kappa
[02/1/18, 11:08:48 AM] <cinphoria> That camera cut looked like there was a subliminal message frame in between :P

[02/1/18, 11:08:58 AM] <stargazer1977> @pagegirl34 hello, hope you are having a great evening.
[02/1/18, 11:09:00 AM] <crthemighty> fun fact! marijuana was made illegal because rockefeller had a competing rope company
[02/1/18, 11:09:06 AM] <kadosho> @super390 Scalped
[02/1/18, 11:09:08 AM] <thatonerlytallguy> Really good book that is tangential to this discussion is "The Medium is the Massage" by Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore
[02/1/18, 11:09:09 AM] <Darkelven00> @owifig Man was not meant to reach so far!
[02/1/18, 11:09:09 AM] <derekleeketchum> we all need a bad friend like Taliesin Kappa
[02/1/18, 11:09:17 AM] <Karraxx> its the whole concept of "if i dont enjoy this, then no one can enjoy it"
[02/1/18, 11:09:23 AM] <Gerpes11> monkaS
[02/1/18, 11:09:24 AM] <misssunflower94> the damn youths *shakes fist*
[02/1/18, 11:09:28 AM] <halfaringcircus> Poor people can afford it? It must be a terrible influence!
[02/1/18, 11:09:29 AM] <kadosho> That is worth a read
[02/1/18, 11:09:40 AM] <souzo_> Question: if the comic code never happened, then do you think comics would be more popular now or less popular?
[02/1/18, 11:09:46 AM] <SprlngheelJack> The 30's were terrible,banning weed AND comic books? monsters, the lot of them
[02/1/18, 11:09:48 AM] <pagegirl34> @stargazer1977 having a crappy evening but better now watching a good show and talking to you
[02/1/18, 11:10:02 AM] <chiplickin> Awkward
[02/1/18, 11:10:07 AM] <DEATHlikescats> kinda like 70's movies. just tried everything
[02/1/18, 11:10:09 AM] <stargazer1977> @pagegirl34 why thank you, I hope the upward trend continues. <3
[02/1/18, 11:10:09 AM] <japenrose> @SprlngheelJack Don't forget the leftover bit of Prohibition until the repeal!
[02/1/18, 11:10:14 AM] <pagegirl34> Interesting topic today
[02/1/18, 11:10:23 AM] <Darkelven00> 1942 is an anagram for... 1492.... NEW WORLDS!
[02/1/18, 11:10:28 AM] <Dubward> 5 min topic idea "what would be your code approved comic book?"
[02/1/18, 11:10:28 AM] <Smarcey> Chieeeeeeeef
[02/1/18, 11:10:31 AM] <KBTibbs> "Crime" is too big for a title!
[02/1/18, 11:10:38 AM] <tortugadelmar> Besides moral panic there was also the fact that parents don't always sit down with their children to explain stuff they see in media
[02/1/18, 11:10:40 AM] ** AromiaFlyce stares at the screen
[02/1/18, 11:10:47 AM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype
[02/1/18, 11:10:55 AM] <SprlngheelJack> I want that as a poster!
[02/1/18, 11:10:55 AM] <EmxLBJ> Can someone quickly tell me the jist of the topic tonight? Just tuned in, not sure what "Seduction of the innocent" means exactly.
[02/1/18, 11:11:03 AM] <crthemighty> props to the dude doing a flip in the back
[02/1/18, 11:11:07 AM] <VermillionCrimson> "The case of the twisted cigarettes?"
[02/1/18, 11:11:11 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Dafuq
[02/1/18, 11:11:15 AM] <Dubward> @emxlbj Comics Code
[02/1/18, 11:11:24 AM] <FuffyButt> CRIME DOSE not PAY
[02/1/18, 11:11:27 AM] <misssunflower94> @EmxLBJ it was the name of a thinkpiece about how comics were corrupting kids
[02/1/18, 11:11:37 AM] <mathemagician_> @EmxLBJ it's about the comics code, there was a moral panic and what could be put in comics was restricted
[02/1/18, 11:11:39 AM] <souzo_> my parents never once talked to me about what was good/bad in media
[02/1/18, 11:11:40 AM] <Smarcey> Y’all see them flips?
[02/1/18, 11:11:47 AM] <stargazer1977> Crime stories have been sensationalized and popular since the invention of writing. Ancient history is a specialty of mine, this is not new.
[02/1/18, 11:11:49 AM] <TommyHobo> Crime doesn't pay but it's got one heck of a dental plan.
[02/1/18, 11:11:52 AM] <EmxLBJ> Appreciate you guys. Got it!
[02/1/18, 11:12:07 AM] <JeffM0307> Or criminals
[02/1/18, 11:12:12 AM] <Smarcey> So does that mean we can bring back punching Nazis in comics?
[02/1/18, 11:12:13 AM] <owifig> The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
[02/1/18, 11:12:13 AM] <tortugadelmar> oh Nazi punching, so satisfying
[02/1/18, 11:12:14 AM] <Fatty_Melt> Oh we got Trouble! With capital T that rhymes with C that stands for COMICS!
[02/1/18, 11:12:21 AM] <Darkelven00> @stargazer1977 Are you Vandal Savage?
[02/1/18, 11:12:23 AM] <littelnemo> was this before or after shazzam
[02/1/18, 11:12:27 AM] <Smarcey> Cause I’m really down for some new Nazi punching comics
[02/1/18, 11:12:28 AM] <japenrose> @Fatty_Melt Points for that!
[02/1/18, 11:12:28 AM] <misssunflower94> ''''true'''' crime stories
[02/1/18, 11:12:34 AM] <SprlngheelJack> @owifig and dan ass herb
[02/1/18, 11:12:37 AM] <ToonEzon> damn i'm late
[02/1/18, 11:12:38 AM] <SprlngheelJack> *dank
[02/1/18, 11:12:42 AM] <AromiaFlyce> lmao
[02/1/18, 11:12:44 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> Modern media needs more Nazi punching. XD
[02/1/18, 11:12:57 AM] <ToonEzon> hate that i missed the beginning
[02/1/18, 11:12:58 AM] <Fatty_Melt> @japenrose I couldn't resist! XD
[02/1/18, 11:13:04 AM] <SprlngheelJack> Punch ALL he nazis
[02/1/18, 11:13:05 AM] <RuzgofDI> I've seen enough Wednesday Club to know there's not such thing as a short derail
[02/1/18, 11:13:09 AM] <japenrose> @Smarcey Check out America! You won't be disappointed, her comic gives you what you want
[02/1/18, 11:13:13 AM] <CustomThrow420> hello
