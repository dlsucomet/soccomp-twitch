[02/2/18, 8:02:56 AM] <Nuellenore> I’ve not even watched any of the first campaign, but up to date with C2 and interested in listening to the first one.
[02/2/18, 8:02:59 AM] <Salbastro> @cinphoria I wonder how long it took to get all that glitter out though
[02/2/18, 8:03:06 AM] <shidareAKI> Glitterlord has been banished back to his realm. Who knows when we'll be able to summon him again.
