[02/3/18, 1:10:46 PM] <misssunflower94> I only know Murder by Death as a band

[02/3/18, 1:10:59 PM] <chaoticloony> I still love Murder By Death!
[02/3/18, 1:11:02 PM] <Adamkunn> I'd say that Clue is probably one of Tim Curry's best comedy fims.
[02/3/18, 1:11:03 PM] <stargazer1977> I agree with Tal, Murder by Death is good, but not great. Clue is a much better movie and still holds up.
[02/3/18, 1:11:03 PM] <Pandaikon0980> Murder by Death is so good!
[02/3/18, 1:11:03 PM] <botanarchy> Clue is a goddamn cinematic masterpiece

[02/3/18, 1:13:45 PM] <101deadpool1017> I recently saw the new murder on the orient express
[02/3/18, 1:13:45 PM] <chaoticloony> Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys were great books!
[02/3/18, 1:13:45 PM] <OkamiTaretsu> WOO!
[02/3/18, 1:13:47 PM] <stargazer1977> @MissNayoung wow, very cool, I might have to look into importing.
[02/3/18, 1:13:49 PM] <philbe63> Encyclopedia Brown was my speed.
[02/3/18, 1:13:49 PM] <iamtheomegaman> looks like Marisha hehe
[02/3/18, 1:13:50 PM] <anniedisaster09> There's a Miss Fisher movie???!!
[02/3/18, 1:13:51 PM] <autisticcosplay> taliesin looks so good.
[02/3/18, 1:13:53 PM] <ladyamphy> Can't wait for the Miss Fisher movie
[02/3/18, 1:13:54 PM] <DwarfSpike> Nancy Drew and the Crooked HOLY CRAP A ROBOT
[02/3/18, 1:13:56 PM] <artistsomeday> I want all the gin and mystery books
[02/3/18, 1:13:57 PM] <TheLurkingJandel> I second Miss Fischer. She's the best.

[02/3/18, 1:14:08 PM] <botanarchy> for when the robots come with their cold arms.... and they will
[02/3/18, 1:14:13 PM] <chaoticloony> Re hrpgSub hrpgHyperHype gandsSubHype
[02/3/18, 1:14:16 PM] <RonTheRBDM> i loved those yellow spines of the Nancy Drew books
[02/3/18, 1:14:20 PM] <starpilotsix> Most of my favorite mysteries/detectives are science fictional. Like Marid Audran in George Alec Effinger's "When Gravity Fails" (who has cybernetic implants and brain chips that let him take on the personalities of other famous detectives, like Nero Wolf at one point).
[02/3/18, 1:14:22 PM] <Slippydude> @TheLurkingJandel Thirded
[02/3/18, 1:14:23 PM] <misssunflower94> I'm not that far in Miss Fisher yet but omg a movie? that's gonna be awesome
[02/3/18, 1:14:24 PM] <coffeeandbows> @pagegirl34 Clue!
[02/3/18, 1:14:24 PM] <shortbutevil> 80s were fucked up... flammable water
[02/3/18, 1:14:41 PM] <autisticcosplay> @cinphoria sidenote: taliesin looks so good.
[02/3/18, 1:14:41 PM] <anniedisaster09> The books are fabulous as well
[02/3/18, 1:14:44 PM] <stargazer1977> I read Sherlock Holmes too young, it ruined me for all the young adult mysteries like Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. They just weren't nearly as good as Doyle's stuff.
[02/3/18, 1:14:45 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> they wanted the vintage look when they appeared at Walden Books
[02/3/18, 1:14:46 PM] <stardustinoureyes> Flammable water?
[02/3/18, 1:14:48 PM] <chaoticloony> 80's were a great time to be a teen!
[02/3/18, 1:14:48 PM] <DwarfSpike> Anyone remember the Bobbsey Twins books?
[02/3/18, 1:14:49 PM] <cinphoria> @autisticcosplay as always :3
[02/3/18, 1:14:53 PM] <ladyamphy> I backed the movie and got a signed bookmark from Nathan Page who is Detective Jack
[02/3/18, 1:14:58 PM] <pagegirl34> @stargazer1977 hey! sorry I could not get to Amy's book club
[02/3/18, 1:14:59 PM] <starpilotsix> Or Altered Carbon, an adaptation of which just debuted on Netflix.
[02/3/18, 1:14:59 PM] <MissNayoung> One of my fave detectives is Conan Edogawa from Detective Conan/Case Closed.
[02/3/18, 1:15:00 PM] <iamtheomegaman> @danoba this could also be called gather your mobster.
[02/3/18, 1:15:01 PM] <Somnium_Umbra> I'm afraid to reread the Hardy Boys....I'm worried that, like much that I love as a child, it won't have aged well...
[02/3/18, 1:15:02 PM] <lazugod> she's not talking a lot but I think we can hear rachel now
[02/3/18, 1:15:04 PM] <misssunflower94> I had a small set of Nancy Drew and I for whatever reason thought that those were the oNLY Nancy Drew books ever
[02/3/18, 1:15:04 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> @Slippydude If you ever get a chance to see Jim Butcher in person (like at DragonCon or similar).... do it. He's amazing.

[02/3/18, 1:15:10 PM] <voltron4200> my favorite detectives are Nick & Nora Charles
[02/3/18, 1:15:11 PM] <shortbutevil> UNcalled for
[02/3/18, 1:15:12 PM] <autisticcosplay> @cinphoria so hard boiled much mystery
[02/3/18, 1:15:13 PM] <CarolineTheGeek> "you're not my real Erika"
[02/3/18, 1:15:14 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> Encyclopedia Brown was my jam growing up
[02/3/18, 1:15:15 PM] <coffeeandbows> "you're not my real erika"
[02/3/18, 1:15:24 PM] <misssunflower94> oh NO we're gonna wasted tonight

[02/3/18, 1:15:30 PM] <desertshaddow> There was a river that was so polluted it caught fire in 1969.
[02/3/18, 1:15:32 PM] <artistsomeday> I like you Dani, you're all right.
[02/3/18, 1:15:33 PM] <vexelghost> My liver is already dead.
[02/3/18, 1:15:34 PM] <Themonkeyprincess> :D
[02/3/18, 1:15:34 PM] <Squishypride> wasted on water Kappa
[02/3/18, 1:15:35 PM] <stargazer1977> @pagegirl34 I love Noir as well, they haven't mentioned it specifically yet though. But it is Gather Your Clue, so it might come up. :)
[02/3/18, 1:15:37 PM] <stardustinoureyes> OOh.
[02/3/18, 1:15:38 PM] <theladytiefling> what's a zigzag house
[02/3/18, 1:15:40 PM] <tomservo544> A drink of NyQuil?
[02/3/18, 1:15:43 PM] <UncleOok> all this Jim Butcher talk makes me want to see them do Dresden Files Accelerated on G&S
[02/3/18, 1:15:45 PM] <iamtheomegaman> Johnny Quest
[02/3/18, 1:15:46 PM] <misssunflower94> I have just met Erica and I love her
[02/3/18, 1:15:46 PM] <MissNayoung> Conan Edogawa is a 6 year old Japanese child that solves murders, kidnappings and other sordid mysteries.
[02/3/18, 1:15:46 PM] <shidareAKI> What?!
[02/3/18, 1:15:47 PM] <Slippydude> @mightbeabadidea_ Canadian who doesn't get to the states a bunch
[02/3/18, 1:15:47 PM] <autisticcosplay> a literal zig zag house
[02/3/18, 1:15:50 PM] <tavixx123> its the EVIL STEP-ERIKA
[02/3/18, 1:15:50 PM] <chaoticloony> Erica is always so fabulous!
[02/3/18, 1:15:51 PM] <Pandaikon0980> We're gonna get WASTED!
[02/3/18, 1:15:54 PM] <IsadarGreen> it's 1:30 in the afternoon, i think taking a drink would be bad for me
[02/3/18, 1:15:54 PM] <botanarchy> it was one of the great lakes that caught on fire
[02/3/18, 1:15:55 PM] <voltron4200> my son listens to Encyclopedia Brown ebooks to help him go to sleep
[02/3/18, 1:15:56 PM] <SprlngheelJack> It's funny, cause all the murder mystery i read is either older than this or newer. Murder at the rue morgue being my favourite old detective story.
[02/3/18, 1:15:59 PM] <Prideling> Good thing I'm drinking chamomile tea

[02/3/18, 1:16:10 PM] <DuchessCapra> I have one of the original printings of one of the 1st or 2nd Hardy Books books, and was shocked as a kid that they used a racial slur. Not my good clean Hardy Boys!

[02/3/18, 1:16:53 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> @Slippydude That's a shame. I highly recommend looking up his DragonCon Q/A sessions and similar Gives you a good idea of how he interacts with the fans.
[02/3/18, 1:16:56 PM] <pagegirl34> Nick and Nora Charles were awesome
[02/3/18, 1:16:56 PM] <CarolineTheGeek> Tip #1: Don't lick the paintings.
