[02/7/18, 10:46:26 AM] <TheDiMono> @jpcguy89 Anyway, it's a thing I said. And I meant it: we would rather people not speculate about what's going on behind the scenes, because it can lead to arguments and disrupt chat.

[02/7/18, 10:47:47 AM] <jpcguy89> @TheDiMono As I Said, its extremely difficult if not impossible for me not to express my opinions because of impulse control issues stemming from my brain tumors. You can punish me for something thats entirely out of my control if you'd like, but thats what it boils down to
