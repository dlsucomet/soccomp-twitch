[02/7/18, 12:55:37 PM] <TheOriginalCritKeeper> I first signed up for the free trial with the first Sagas of Sundry finished posting. I've kept it going ever since.
[02/7/18, 12:55:41 PM] <VespertineBunny> I had to deal with this back in 1994 or 1995

[02/7/18, 12:55:51 PM] <RavenWolfe> I sub to both alpha and G and S mainly cause I can afford it and want to support them for all the great content. And there are some things on each that you cant get on the other

[02/7/18, 12:56:13 PM] <victorthenpc> @shidareAKI I didn't mean it like that! For all I know they donate it charity! I'm just saying without knowing its hard for me to validate it. I love it here. I don't see why I should go to Alpha for something I already have and love here
[02/7/18, 12:56:17 PM] <VermillionCrimson> !wtfisthis
[02/7/18, 12:56:17 PM] <Nightbot> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.
[02/7/18, 12:56:18 PM] <Henchman2121> Big howdy to @dragonchrome

[02/7/18, 12:57:13 PM] <calebissupergay> do you guys know what bidet means everyone says it on cr and im always confused
[02/7/18, 12:57:21 PM] <victorthenpc> Hey hey hey hey
[02/7/18, 12:57:25 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> Hey guys!!
[02/7/18, 12:57:28 PM] <KrypticSloth> I can't wait to see how Sam interacts with the guys. It's going to be an interesting episode.
[02/7/18, 12:57:29 PM] <Dragonchrome> @novaplaysdnd it's Grog for Good Day
[02/7/18, 12:57:39 PM] <Raidrith> Does everyone that their drinks handy?
[02/7/18, 12:57:39 PM] <TheOriginalCritKeeper> Bidet is Grog's way of saying 'Good Day' to the elves
[02/7/18, 12:57:39 PM] <Ripartist> hey hey hey hey
[02/7/18, 12:57:40 PM] <GeekTheNoble> it's like a good day and hello that Travis said
[02/7/18, 12:57:42 PM] <japenrose> @novaplaysdnd It's a reference to a moment in the season 1 campaign where Grog says "Bidet" instead of "Good Day"
[02/7/18, 12:57:42 PM] <KrypticSloth> It means Good Day
[02/7/18, 12:57:43 PM] <victorthenpc> @novaplaysdnd you'd need to see season 1 to truly understand it
[02/7/18, 12:57:44 PM] <Emberwatch_Studio> its a running gag
[02/7/18, 12:57:44 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> Aww it still says mines n crafts on the schedule :(
[02/7/18, 12:57:59 PM] <RavenWolfe> bidet is something that Grog says in an epsiode of CR instead of good day
[02/7/18, 12:58:00 PM] <TheOriginalCritKeeper> Just like Be Pleased became 'beep beep'
[02/7/18, 12:58:02 PM] <GeekTheNoble> @Raidrith no, instead I have cinnamon toast crunch with no milk
[02/7/18, 12:58:06 PM] <VermillionCrimson> @novaplaysdnd Just go binge watch campaign one. You'll thank me :P
[02/7/18, 12:58:09 PM] <victorthenpc> @Shadowstorm_0 What happened to Mines n Crafts?!?!
[02/7/18, 12:58:17 PM] <TheDiMono> @Shadowstorm_0 Yeah, we just noticed that too. And we became sad. :(
