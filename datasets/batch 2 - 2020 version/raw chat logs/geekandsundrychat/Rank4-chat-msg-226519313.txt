[02/7/18, 8:07:25 AM] <SophiaL0V3> Kate is a natural.

[02/7/18, 8:11:03 AM] <ryan_witalison> Daniel Day Lewis would be a bad idea, his method acting would lead to some bad things
[02/7/18, 8:11:12 AM] <Chovexani> Lookin' good Kate
[02/7/18, 8:11:23 AM] <Zismarith> Oh. It unhosted Amy. I wonder when.

[02/7/18, 8:14:12 AM] <jpcguy89> @PauladinWon Did you see the M&M commercial?
[02/7/18, 8:14:18 AM] <jpcguy89> XD
[02/7/18, 8:14:22 AM] <Compel_Bast> Literally "professionalisation" of pro gaming?
[02/7/18, 8:14:45 AM] <The_TBoyce> Wait, does U.S. eSports not have sportsmanship requirements? It seems like that would be an important one.
[02/7/18, 8:14:49 AM] <dmdaddy0> who decides the games?
[02/7/18, 8:15:05 AM] <LorinatiDC> Japan has a better depth concept.

[02/7/18, 8:15:16 AM] <Aayer> Where's League of Legends? DansGame
[02/7/18, 8:15:18 AM] <Chovexani> XD my character misquoted "I solemnly swear I'm not up to no good" in my Scion game
[02/7/18, 8:15:24 AM] <The_TBoyce> I feel like a foul for "unsportsmanlike conduct" applies regardless of what sport it is.
[02/7/18, 8:15:37 AM] <droolingpenguin> Japan don't care about LoL, please
[02/7/18, 8:16:03 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Do they have to be a certain age to get the gaming license?
[02/7/18, 8:16:04 AM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe
[02/7/18, 8:16:13 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I don't watch e-sports so I don't care! :D
[02/7/18, 8:16:22 AM] <Jimersion> Bring on the Elympics!!
[02/7/18, 8:16:31 AM] <Ciccati> i love how they are jumping on the esports now, but since they don't know what it is they're going in-depth instead of just using already existing "structures"
[02/7/18, 8:16:58 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Once these leagues become more legitimized maybe that paves the way for gaming becoming an Olympic sport.
[02/7/18, 8:17:05 AM] <stargazer1977> Japan has wanted to move towards getting esports into the Olympics and help grow the scene. This is a good step towards that future.
[02/7/18, 8:17:16 AM] <paladinish421> were is space invaders
[02/7/18, 8:17:23 AM] <quasarix> minecraft esports :D

[02/7/18, 8:18:34 AM] <hybrid_i9> What country are we talking about?
[02/7/18, 8:18:34 AM] <vexelghost> I'm an old timer. I'll only define them as eSports when we have to act out moves in full force feedback clothing.
[02/7/18, 8:18:42 AM] <CPfalken> I still cant understand that Trisha hasnt been outside of NA sodaMONK
[02/7/18, 8:19:11 AM] <Paladin356> i second what Kate says. If you dont have good sportsmanship, i dont want you on my team
[02/7/18, 8:19:20 AM] <Paladin356> play games with honor
[02/7/18, 8:19:23 AM] <Hazabn> Being good at the game might be important as a pro
[02/7/18, 8:19:26 AM] <JeffM0307> Sportsmanship
[02/7/18, 8:19:28 AM] <EmxLBJ> Can we get a segment on Kate's cheek bones?
[02/7/18, 8:19:32 AM] <obblestone> i third what kate said
[02/7/18, 8:19:32 AM] <derekleeketchum> Just have fun but not at the expense of others
[02/7/18, 8:19:32 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Wheaton's law is rule 1
[02/7/18, 8:19:38 AM] <FuffyButt> rule 6: bring snacks
