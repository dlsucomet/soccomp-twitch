[02/7/18, 1:01:08 PM] <CaptainTalon447> So what do they talk about on Asinine Wisdom?

[02/7/18, 1:01:19 PM] <Nightbot> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.

[02/7/18, 1:07:21 PM] <Nightbot> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.
