[02/8/18, 1:50:18 PM] <iamtheomegaman> @danoba joys of twitch, always a audio/tech issue. damn twitch gremlins.
[02/8/18, 1:50:21 PM] <Jjclark21> so far i like what im hear
[02/8/18, 1:50:23 PM] <WeedHappy420> Wait, is this Real? lol
[02/8/18, 1:50:26 PM] <ToonEzon> @TheTriscuit ah
[02/8/18, 1:50:30 PM] <JerrodOwex> Gina and becca are too low
[02/8/18, 1:50:31 PM] <japenrose> !wtfisthis
[02/8/18, 1:50:31 PM] <Nightbot> Weave Society is the RPG tale for the digital age. Storytellers Amy Dallen, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, Stef Woodburn, and Gina DeVivo come together to jump into one of the many fantastical worlds of Weave. Where will they end up next?
[02/8/18, 1:50:31 PM] <thereslettuce> this is gonna be incredible, it sounds like everything exists
[02/8/18, 1:50:34 PM] <CharcoalFeatherFederation> oh dang. didn't realize that was becca even after they said it lol
[02/8/18, 1:50:34 PM] <misssunflower94> That's up there with the town of Humansville in my state
[02/8/18, 1:50:36 PM] <baph0_met> the *only* issue I have with this game/concept is the exclusionary reliance on the app. don't get me wrong - cool idea; but it would be *really nice* not to have to have it...
[02/8/18, 1:50:41 PM] <Tazmojo> the aesthetic is pretty sweet
[02/8/18, 1:50:41 PM] <Zismarith> I'm getting Stranger Things + Xcom.
[02/8/18, 1:50:44 PM] <chaoticloony> In RPG's all that should matter is the role-playing
[02/8/18, 1:50:45 PM] <phoenixgoth> ... There's a Plesiosaur?! I wanna visit here!
[02/8/18, 1:50:47 PM] <Tacotownindustries> @GeekandSundry Becca/Gina are sounding muted
[02/8/18, 1:50:47 PM] <TheTriscuit> @animusMR And it's only 1 of 4 settings currently in the game, with more on the way
[02/8/18, 1:50:55 PM] <LateNightTabletop> Based on a true story @WeedHappy420 LUL
[02/8/18, 1:50:55 PM] <misssunflower94> Humansville - you know, totally where humans live
[02/8/18, 1:50:56 PM] <vexelghost> This does sound fun.
[02/8/18, 1:50:59 PM] <skyling> this reminds me of The Secret World lol
[02/8/18, 1:51:00 PM] <ShandraVdeG> @smogharp The app is free I believe? (but don't quote me on that)
[02/8/18, 1:51:04 PM] <iamtheomegaman> !audio
[02/8/18, 1:51:04 PM] <Nightbot> There is an audio issue that we cannot solve right now, we will see about getting a clean VOD uploaded.
[02/8/18, 1:51:09 PM] <chaoticloony> @smogharp As someone without a phone, i agree
[02/8/18, 1:51:11 PM] <JerrodOwex> @smogharp its free at least(the app that is)
[02/8/18, 1:51:12 PM] <GeekandSundry> We hear you @Tacotownindustries we're fighting a strange sound in one of their packs, we're sorting it out
[02/8/18, 1:51:15 PM] <misssunflower94> this is also giving me Gravity Falls feels
[02/8/18, 1:51:19 PM] <crthemighty> i like that they drop in "unresolved murder" like "whoops, lol, happens all the time"
[02/8/18, 1:51:20 PM] <Fatty_Melt> I dunno what a "moongoob" is, but it sounds totes adorbz
[02/8/18, 1:51:21 PM] <WeedHappy420> @latenighttabletop i Knew it.. kind of
[02/8/18, 1:51:26 PM] <CaptianTrips88> #TheyKnow
[02/8/18, 1:51:27 PM] <Tacotownindustries> @GeekandSundry Got it, sorry
[02/8/18, 1:51:27 PM] <aldoojeda> The setting is crazy as hell.
[02/8/18, 1:51:28 PM] <Impossiblegirl11> hey chat!
[02/8/18, 1:51:29 PM] <phoenixgoth> It's like Night Vale meets Gravity Falls
[02/8/18, 1:51:35 PM] <FernsMansion> Okay My inner gloomy is already in love with this game eeks
[02/8/18, 1:51:36 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Impossiblegirl11

[02/8/18, 1:51:39 PM] <yapyap92> hey @Impossiblegirl11 !!

[02/8/18, 1:51:50 PM] <talahar> gosh darn i love this setting :D
[02/8/18, 1:51:53 PM] <CosmicVoyagerX> OOPS
[02/8/18, 1:51:53 PM] <TheTriscuit> @smogharp It wouldn't really be possible without the app. Each playset has over 500 potential options that are interpreted from the cards
[02/8/18, 1:51:56 PM] <JeffM0307> Bloom County, as in Bill The Cat
[02/8/18, 1:51:57 PM] <hypatiasangst> gloomies is the only rpg i've played where a school child sacrificed her own soul to a super computer
[02/8/18, 1:51:57 PM] <wildbronco38> Hey @Impossiblegirl11
[02/8/18, 1:51:57 PM] <Astragali> The audio issue is interference from the interdimensional tear ;)
[02/8/18, 1:51:58 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> @GeekandSundry It is probably Becca's Anti-cheat aura...
[02/8/18, 1:51:59 PM] <LateNightTabletop> APP is free. you can download it on android and iOS and get a feel for the stories
[02/8/18, 1:52:00 PM] <CharacterStigma> LUL I'm loving this game already
[02/8/18, 1:52:00 PM] <baph0_met> anyone know how to find out when the DRGN playset will be available? or how to write our own playsets?
[02/8/18, 1:52:03 PM] <november23> I‚Äôm a dubious astronaut, self employed.
[02/8/18, 1:52:03 PM] <GeekandSundry> @iamtheomegaman thats our plan
[02/8/18, 1:52:07 PM] <plumbloco> Goonies, ASSEMBLE
[02/8/18, 1:52:11 PM] <phoenixgoth> of COURSE it does
[02/8/18, 1:52:14 PM] <TakaraOtN6> i love this
[02/8/18, 1:52:14 PM] <talahar> it gets better and better!
[02/8/18, 1:52:15 PM] <Zismarith> @CosmicVoyagerX Yep getting that.
[02/8/18, 1:52:17 PM] <CosmicVoyagerX> I hate when caps lock does not have a light on it./
[02/8/18, 1:52:21 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Deathstar_Taco she found a way out of her anti-cheat aura... we're working on another fix
[02/8/18, 1:52:22 PM] <Impossiblegirl11> Long time no see! @wildbronco38
[02/8/18, 1:52:23 PM] <duypham1994> What going on?
[02/8/18, 1:52:24 PM] <Henchman2121> UFO Bigfoot vampires and g-men...what could go wrong?
[02/8/18, 1:52:28 PM] <ToonEzon> is it possible to play this game in extended campaigns, or only as oneshot adventures
[02/8/18, 1:52:30 PM] <Danoba> !wtfisthis
[02/8/18, 1:52:30 PM] <misssunflower94> so there are vampires and goblins and aliens and government scientists and demons oH MY

[02/8/18, 1:52:30 PM] <FernsMansion> Aliens, and Goblins, and Demons oh my!
[02/8/18, 1:52:33 PM] <mini_jas> I'd much rather go to the astronaut facility than the carnival. Astronauts > carnies
[02/8/18, 1:52:34 PM] <hypatiasangst> @smogharp they have the github listing for how to get started
[02/8/18, 1:52:36 PM] <phoenixgoth> Oh wonderful! Cthulu + Supernatural + Night Vale + Gravity Falls
[02/8/18, 1:52:37 PM] <TheTriscuit> @smogharp Come join the Weave Discord from the app and we'll help you on your way to making your own playset
[02/8/18, 1:52:44 PM] <iamtheomegaman> @geekandsundry gandsSCANLAN gandsSCANLAN
[02/8/18, 1:52:50 PM] <plumbloco> GOONIES
[02/8/18, 1:52:56 PM] <misssunflower94> there's like 50 plot threads I love it
[02/8/18, 1:52:56 PM] <chaoticloony> @duypham1994 This is a bit about the world that they are adventuring in tonight!
[02/8/18, 1:53:01 PM] <BlairBeveridge> Time Bandits?
[02/8/18, 1:53:06 PM] <LateNightTabletop> and Goonies @phoenixgoth ha!
[02/8/18, 1:53:07 PM] <Zismarith> Oh, and now we get The Neverending Story.
[02/8/18, 1:53:10 PM] <yapyap92> lookee! viewer count of MnC + AXYB combined!
[02/8/18, 1:53:10 PM] <BigBalla5412> Kobra Kai
[02/8/18, 1:53:11 PM] <VermillionCrimson> dafuq is this town?
[02/8/18, 1:53:12 PM] <november23> The void and my refrigerator have a lot in common
[02/8/18, 1:53:12 PM] <talahar> of course it does.
[02/8/18, 1:53:17 PM] <CruelMotivator> I wish DM had more screen space
[02/8/18, 1:53:17 PM] <TheTriscuit> They made it all the way to the end of the description
[02/8/18, 1:53:26 PM] <chaoticloony> I resemble that remark!
[02/8/18, 1:53:26 PM] <ToonEzon> oh my god, this story has everything
[02/8/18, 1:53:27 PM] <qpqg> it does really continue
[02/8/18, 1:53:30 PM] <iamtheomegaman> @danoba blue effect on the bricks is cool af.
[02/8/18, 1:53:31 PM] <phoenixgoth> (I somehow feel like Taliesin would be right at home in this place.)
[02/8/18, 1:53:32 PM] <TheTriscuit> The absolute madwomen! They did it!
[02/8/18, 1:53:32 PM] <crthemighty> i was born in the 80s, this all seems legit
[02/8/18, 1:53:33 PM] <Xilent11> Does this chanell really has 100k subs?
[02/8/18, 1:53:33 PM] <BigBalla5412> This entire town is a collection of 80's Movie Plots
[02/8/18, 1:53:37 PM] <zola_cfc> time traveling dwarves?... i‚Äôm all in
[02/8/18, 1:53:38 PM] <Morn_80> 80s and early 90s..can confirm pretty lax
[02/8/18, 1:53:39 PM] <tatzelthess> I missed the start, what's going on?
[02/8/18, 1:53:39 PM] <RavenWolfe> awesome!!
[02/8/18, 1:53:39 PM] <5horbust> BEAUTIFUL.
[02/8/18, 1:53:42 PM] <talahar> @VermillionCrimson only the best town ever :p
[02/8/18, 1:53:43 PM] <LateNightTabletop> and pretty much every other stereotypical 80s esque film
[02/8/18, 1:53:43 PM] <GeekandSundry> @CruelMotivator she'll get more when we are not showing the cards
[02/8/18, 1:53:46 PM] <misssunflower94> @phoenixgoth Taliesin is the mayor
[02/8/18, 1:53:46 PM] <davidflegel> This is going to be great!
[02/8/18, 1:53:48 PM] <paladinsnpajamas> fing amazing
[02/8/18, 1:53:48 PM] <dauntz> sound check needed!
[02/8/18, 1:53:49 PM] <wanderingace> hmmm...Interesting place...remind me not to move there.
[02/8/18, 1:53:49 PM] <WeedHappy420> what about the unicorns?
[02/8/18, 1:53:51 PM] <Zismarith> So this is every fantasy/scifi movie from 1981-1993 rolled into one, basically.
[02/8/18, 1:53:51 PM] <Kaprinae> They're all so adorable, oh my goodness.
[02/8/18, 1:53:54 PM] <Cabelerapvp> :D
[02/8/18, 1:53:56 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> there has to be some serious ley lines
[02/8/18, 1:53:56 PM] <phoenixgoth> @misssunflower94 ahahaha yes
[02/8/18, 1:53:56 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Is this a one of or is it a week by week thing we the same people (i hope) @GeekandSundry
[02/8/18, 1:53:57 PM] <Cercium> @Xilent11 come back thursday night
[02/8/18, 1:53:58 PM] <chaoticloony> @Xilent11 It has more than 1 and less than infinity
[02/8/18, 1:53:58 PM] <baph0_met> + Stranger Things+ Never Ending Story.... hehe, I love it
[02/8/18, 1:53:59 PM] <mini_jas> but are they time-travelling astronaut carnival dwarves?
[02/8/18, 1:54:00 PM] <aldoojeda> k, already in love with this
[02/8/18, 1:54:00 PM] <WriteWhatYouLove> <3
[02/8/18, 1:54:03 PM] <TakaraOtN6> YES
[02/8/18, 1:54:04 PM] <Danoba> @iamtheomegaman That was Selina's idea and it is.
[02/8/18, 1:54:04 PM] <LawsOnMe> Wow. I love it. Every 80s Sci-Fi/Fantasy kid group flick in one playset.
[02/8/18, 1:54:06 PM] <JC_Wijma> So basically Stranger Things on steroids?
[02/8/18, 1:54:09 PM] <LateNightTabletop> Character Creation = So Fast!
[02/8/18, 1:54:10 PM] <GeekandSundry> yes @PipersTwin
[02/8/18, 1:54:15 PM] <silverstardruid> taliesin would definitely be mayor
[02/8/18, 1:54:16 PM] <r_ricker> I was a teen in a small town in the '80s. That made it sound so much more fun than it was
[02/8/18, 1:54:16 PM] <MoxReuby> They read the story of Gloomies like my family reads the story of Passpver from the Haggadah :)
[02/8/18, 1:54:20 PM] <baph0_met> as far as I have seen, this seems to be the favorite playset
[02/8/18, 1:54:27 PM] <iamtheomegaman> @danoba Selina is a deco god!
[02/8/18, 1:54:27 PM] <KBTibbs> Fast character creation? Sad.
