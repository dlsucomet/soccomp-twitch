[02/9/18, 8:03:40 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green and a guest spend 90 minutes going deeper into a fandom then you may have thought possible. From Magic: The Gathering to Street Fighter weâ€™re examining the stories and worldbuilding that makes these properties so enchanting. The guests and subjects are as varied as can be but the one thing that brings them together is passion.
[02/9/18, 8:03:43 AM] <crthemighty> yaaaay, big fam bros!
[02/9/18, 8:03:50 AM] <JJ_Dane> So is Glitterlord a thing of the past now that Ryan can actually see the colours?
[02/9/18, 8:03:50 AM] <chiplickin> Ryan has better hair than I do, and I can't even be mad at him
[02/9/18, 8:03:53 AM] <Danoba> Happy Birthday @amayabacon
[02/9/18, 8:03:53 AM] <shidareAKI> Ryan moves ever closer to being nothing but hair.
[02/9/18, 8:03:54 AM] <stargazer1977> Afrofuturism is cool, feel free to talk about it more. :)

[02/9/18, 8:06:16 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> it is interweb if you end up missing hours of your day too often to count while on it @sssllarr
[02/9/18, 8:06:23 AM] <shidareAKI> Congrats, btw, Ryan, on being able to see in color!
[02/9/18, 8:06:34 AM] <GreenishPtero> LUL

[02/9/18, 8:07:35 AM] <shidareAKI> !glitter Ryan
[02/9/18, 8:07:35 AM] <sssllarr> that doesnot make any sense Deathsatar
[02/9/18, 8:07:35 AM] ** Nightbot casts Glitter on Ryan. It goes EVERYWHERE!
[02/9/18, 8:07:46 AM] <stargazer1977> This is already an amazing episode. Thursday is turning out to be my favorite day of the week, even beyond CR.
[02/9/18, 8:07:48 AM] <cinphoria> Ryan being able to see colours is so pure <3
[02/9/18, 8:07:50 AM] <Sylien_> So Ryan thought white people were like, Aasimar?
[02/9/18, 8:07:52 AM] <breene123> Is this the channel where Critical Role Happens
[02/9/18, 8:07:54 AM] <shidareAKI> @cinphoria I knooooow
[02/9/18, 8:07:56 AM] <Ossborn> TIL, black people are actually martians and only Ryan can see their true nature :-D
[02/9/18, 8:08:01 AM] <cinphoria> @shidareAKI so cuuuuute
[02/9/18, 8:08:04 AM] <JJ_Dane> That twitter thread totally made up for all the crap I watched on Twitter the whole of last year
[02/9/18, 8:08:05 AM] <shidareAKI> !wheniscr
[02/9/18, 8:08:05 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role is on at 7 PM PST on Thursdays, it is currently 4:08 PM PST on Thursday. There is 2 Hours, 51 Minutes, 55 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 764 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[02/9/18, 8:08:06 AM] <stargazer1977> @breene123 yes
[02/9/18, 8:08:09 AM] <GreenishPtero> Those glasses look amzing Ryan
[02/9/18, 8:08:10 AM] <JerrodOwex> Yeah Ryan doesnt need help getting distracted he does just fine on his own!
[02/9/18, 8:08:12 AM] <cinphoria> "Learn colour and accept it." XD
[02/9/18, 8:08:13 AM] <AlphaSnowolf78> so white people were drow and black people were half orcs
[02/9/18, 8:08:25 AM] <breene123> Sorry
[02/9/18, 8:08:29 AM] <splashtdubz> ^
[02/9/18, 8:08:37 AM] <TheComicBookAddict> FOR THE HORDE!

[02/9/18, 8:08:37 AM] <cinphoria> @AlphaSnowolf78 drow are black :3
[02/9/18, 8:08:40 AM] ** shidareAKI made her Aasimar brown af and will fight anyone who has something to say about it.
[02/9/18, 8:08:45 AM] <cinphoria> heehee
[02/9/18, 8:08:50 AM] <stargazer1977> @breene123 no need to apologize, everyone has been new once.
[02/9/18, 8:08:52 AM] <Joesyphh> How could anyone not be For The Horde?
[02/9/18, 8:08:56 AM] <JerrodOwex> @AlphaSnowolf78 Drow are like BLACK black
[02/9/18, 8:08:59 AM] <AlphaSnowolf78> @cinphoria crap,
[02/9/18, 8:09:04 AM] <shidareAKI> @Queso_Bandido that command only works for rebroadcasts of critical role and the episode has not yet aired
[02/9/18, 8:09:06 AM] <cinphoria> @Queso_Bandido that's only for rebroadcast of CR. We're 8 minutes into the show
[02/9/18, 8:09:08 AM] <JerrodOwex> @shidareAKI thats... interesting!
[02/9/18, 8:09:08 AM] <crthemighty> being an art person, i am always fascinated talking to colorblind people. it's like the old thought experiment about "what if everyone sees the sky as a different color"
[02/9/18, 8:09:14 AM] <Sylien_> @shidareAKI Go nuts! They are just the only DnD race I can think off that go light grey sometimes.

[02/9/18, 8:10:36 AM] <MiHonoKo> Do you enjoy comic books more with the glasses or is it disconcerting?

[02/9/18, 8:10:55 AM] <chaoticloony> Even swords love knowledge!
[02/9/18, 8:11:00 AM] <swiftfingers> @breene123 it is during live, it doesn't rebroadcast though
[02/9/18, 8:11:29 AM] <renson_arcalian> Thanks it worked that time
[02/9/18, 8:11:30 AM] <Danoba> Okay, now it's fixed.
[02/9/18, 8:11:35 AM] <breene123> Ah, so its not on their youtube channel?
[02/9/18, 8:11:44 AM] <crthemighty> there was no telling kirby "no"
[02/9/18, 8:11:47 AM] <stargazer1977> Nice reference to They Live, @flammonster
[02/9/18, 8:11:47 AM] <JerrodOwex> @flammonster I have a butt you can kick if you need one ;)
[02/9/18, 8:11:59 AM] <flammonster> stankyLOVE
[02/9/18, 8:12:12 AM] <splashtdubz> i find Black Panther to be in bad taste i prefer to refer to him as African Wakandan Panther :D
[02/9/18, 8:12:22 AM] <spamdeserus> Wakanda was not just a good nation, It WAS THE BEST!
[02/9/18, 8:12:37 AM] <VermillionCrimson> They mentioned that on The Wednesday Club, but I didn't know they colored over it. I remember them showing a unused cover that showed the face.
[02/9/18, 8:12:39 AM] <hemilytiger> Africa ain't that backwards tho, Cape Town's pretty big, that one city is almost as populated as the whole of Norway. It's a pretty urban place too, with skyscrapers and the like.
[02/9/18, 8:12:41 AM] <spamdeserus> MAKE WAKANDA GREATER....
[02/9/18, 8:12:50 AM] <tethered_raven> wow didn't realize the superhero predated the party
[02/9/18, 8:13:08 AM] <breene123> Sorry for askin all these questions
[02/9/18, 8:13:24 AM] <swiftfingers> @breene123 no worries
[02/9/18, 8:13:30 AM] <cinphoria> Man, I forgot how much I appreciate BDave and Damion hosting a talk show together. *tears*
[02/9/18, 8:13:33 AM] <JerrodOwex> @tethered_raven theres more to it as well but they may touch on it here though, they did on TWC last night
[02/9/18, 8:13:36 AM] <spamdeserus> Better ask questions than not asking when you don't know something
[02/9/18, 8:13:42 AM] <stargazer1977> @breene123 Critical Role is posted every Monday on Youtube, but Talks Machina is never posted there.
[02/9/18, 8:13:48 AM] <chaoticloony> @breene123 It is ok, we like to help people
[02/9/18, 8:14:05 AM] <spamdeserus> @cinphoria yeah, it's my first time with them, but I like their style
[02/9/18, 8:14:12 AM] <chaoticloony> @cinphoria I know, they need to be on weekly!
[02/9/18, 8:14:39 AM] <breene123> Thanks guys! Youre a big help!
