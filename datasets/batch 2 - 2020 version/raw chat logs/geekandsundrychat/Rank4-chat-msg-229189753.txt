[02/15/18, 9:12:05 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry I think there might be a bad cable, I have been hearing a bit of crackling since yesterday rather regularly.
[02/15/18, 9:12:05 AM] <amajarama> SO JEALOUS OF HECTORS GF
[02/15/18, 9:12:22 AM] <bastienfils> I think those bottom right hearts are made of fried baloney
[02/15/18, 9:12:40 AM] <AstralUnicorn> mm baloney
[02/15/18, 9:12:55 AM] <snatchedforgods> they are aliens that resemble hearts :(
[02/15/18, 9:13:00 AM] <Ormaugus> what did i just walk into
[02/15/18, 9:13:05 AM] <japenrose> !wtfisthis
[02/15/18, 9:13:05 AM] <Nightbot> This is Dick & Johnson! An improvised RPG using the "All Outta Bubblegum" system and the adventure is determined by YOU!
[02/15/18, 9:13:16 AM] <Chovexani> So much hearts
[02/15/18, 9:13:25 AM] <treehonesty> Codeine?
[02/15/18, 9:13:38 AM] <101deadpool1017> It's Dick and Johnson!
[02/15/18, 9:13:38 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Ormaugus something you probably won't be able to walk out of... at least for a while
[02/15/18, 9:13:46 AM] <steelneko> So, it's Bitcoin?
[02/15/18, 9:13:48 AM] <CharacterStigma> PowerUpL gandsOwl PowerUpR

[02/15/18, 9:14:05 AM] <YebbaDebba> it sounds okay on my end @John_Sparks_Jr
[02/15/18, 9:14:08 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> its Johnson sans Dick
[02/15/18, 9:14:08 AM] <bastienfils> This isn't weird. Just an ordinary day.
[02/15/18, 9:14:10 AM] <treehonesty> it's like grubhub except for love
[02/15/18, 9:14:26 AM] <Chovexani> ewwwww
[02/15/18, 9:14:32 AM] <AstralUnicorn> :(
[02/15/18, 9:14:46 AM] <cedon> Missed 10 minutes, i miss much?
[02/15/18, 9:14:50 AM] <chaoticloony> This is the Saxiest Bird i have ever seen!
[02/15/18, 9:14:51 AM] <super390> Codeine? He's making sizzurp?
[02/15/18, 9:15:04 AM] <bastienfils> @cedon about a million hearts
[02/15/18, 9:15:05 AM] <Nightbot> We have a subscriber-only Discord server! Join here: https://discord.gg/geekandsundry (you'll need to sub and link it to your Twitch) and be a part of the fun!...Warning: It can take up to an hour for the server to update and give you access to the channels
[02/15/18, 9:15:13 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @YebbaDebba Really? You don't hear it? It's kind of at the top of the audio spikes, crackling in certain wording.
[02/15/18, 9:15:14 AM] <YebbaDebba> almost up to 2 million now!
[02/15/18, 9:15:14 AM] <Chovexani> XD @chaoticloony
[02/15/18, 9:15:28 AM] <cedon> Cool
[02/15/18, 9:15:29 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL
[02/15/18, 9:15:50 AM] <The_TBoyce> Now I really want to see the Mexican eagle with the snake in its talons, because that would be badass!
[02/15/18, 9:16:03 AM] <starpilotsix> Canadian Beaver doesn't help with romance stuff, too many innuendos with his name.
[02/15/18, 9:16:04 AM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe
[02/15/18, 9:16:18 AM] <bastienfils> had to get his jetpack from the jetpack room
[02/15/18, 9:16:29 AM] <YebbaDebba> Definitely not, I would try some adjustments on your end and see if that helps? I don't usually go above 50% on my speakers here and i am at 100 now and nothing is crackling. sorry that's happening @John_Sparks_Jr !
[02/15/18, 9:16:32 AM] <CharacterStigma> HSWP LUL
[02/15/18, 9:16:33 AM] <Chovexani> sounds legit @starpilotsix
[02/15/18, 9:16:46 AM] <Magic_Odin> jatpack room XD :D
[02/15/18, 9:17:00 AM] <japenrose> @YebbaDebba I can hear it too, it's just pretty quiet
[02/15/18, 9:17:16 AM] <YebbaDebba> really?!? your ears are better than mine then.
[02/15/18, 9:17:31 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @YebbaDebba There's really no adjustment to make. I pretty much have to be at 75% or higher volume for this channel as a whole.
[02/15/18, 9:17:40 AM] <bastienfils> I just hear "exhaust" ;)
[02/15/18, 9:18:03 AM] <japenrose> @YebbaDebba I leaned near my speakers to confirm, but yeah. It's slight
[02/15/18, 9:18:09 AM] <chaoticloony> This is the 2nd most Chaotic show on the channel! :)
[02/15/18, 9:18:22 AM] <YebbaDebba> i'm at 100% everything and still don't really hear it :-/
[02/15/18, 9:18:27 AM] <101deadpool1017> I can also hear the faint crackling noise
[02/15/18, 9:18:32 AM] <goldrif> hi
[02/15/18, 9:18:34 AM] <Karenator42> You would know, @chaoticloony
[02/15/18, 9:18:45 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @goldrif
[02/15/18, 9:18:58 AM] <YebbaDebba> well if Japenrose hears it @John_Sparks_Jr - we'll see what we can do!
[02/15/18, 9:19:00 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL
[02/15/18, 9:19:01 AM] <treehonesty> listen, if the jetpack alone doesnt help you romance ladies, idk what to tell you
[02/15/18, 9:19:27 AM] <The_TBoyce> Wow...Romance Eagle is really bad at his job.
[02/15/18, 9:19:45 AM] <treehonesty> @The_TBoyce he's new
[02/15/18, 9:20:00 AM] <Chovexani> f-list
[02/15/18, 9:20:04 AM] <bastienfils> Apparently Tinder is getting the Bumble-style selection in a future update. Johnson might appreciate that more.
[02/15/18, 9:20:18 AM] <Chovexani> send Johnson to f- list
[02/15/18, 9:20:18 AM] <amajarama> sounds perfect to me
[02/15/18, 9:20:44 AM] <101deadpool1017> Johnson is moon walking
[02/15/18, 9:21:10 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehhehe, Johnson's boots have no soul!
[02/15/18, 9:21:35 AM] <YebbaDebba> hahaha!
[02/15/18, 9:21:38 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL If the eagle uses Harem-Jutsu i'm gonna lose it lol
[02/15/18, 9:21:45 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> just imagine what this show could do with blockbuster-scale budgets
[02/15/18, 9:22:28 AM] <Nightbot> mznjcsnm -> Only those that we deem worthy shall possess the power of the Hyperlink [warning]
[02/15/18, 9:22:35 AM] <101deadpool1017> It would be like a transformers movie, but entertaining
[02/15/18, 9:22:44 AM] <tavixx123> gandsGandsModAlert
[02/15/18, 9:22:58 AM] <chaoticloony> @101deadpool1017 100 points for that!
[02/15/18, 9:23:00 AM] <bastienfils> XD
[02/15/18, 9:23:02 AM] <Colt9482> wtf
[02/15/18, 9:23:12 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @YebbaDebba Just to be sure I wasn't insane, I tested the audio from my Corsair headset, I still hear it in the background at high volume. I still think G&S might have a bad piece of audio equipment somewhere, or the chaining of audio through various sources weakens it somewhere.
[02/15/18, 9:23:32 AM] <bastienfils> Does Valentines Eagle know The Eagles?
[02/15/18, 9:23:40 AM] <YebbaDebba> we're looking into it @John_Sparks_Jr - thanks :D
[02/15/18, 9:23:43 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL America
[02/15/18, 9:23:44 AM] <japenrose> @John_Sparks_Jr We've let Danoba know and they're going to try and figure it out
[02/15/18, 9:23:55 AM] <101deadpool1017> @bastienfils the band or the football team?
[02/15/18, 9:24:22 AM] <Danoba> Yup, we're working on it. Thanks for letting us know.
[02/15/18, 9:24:24 AM] <thomaswdyoung> Johnson just texting away all through his "date"
[02/15/18, 9:24:29 AM] <bastienfils> they're different?
