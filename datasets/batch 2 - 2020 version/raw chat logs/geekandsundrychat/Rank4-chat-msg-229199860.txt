[02/15/18, 11:11:18 AM] <The_TBoyce> I got stood up by a date on Valentine's Day, and I still love the holiday.
[02/15/18, 11:11:21 AM] <stargazer1977> I hate Christmas, but I don't go around trying to rain on other people when it's here, same goes for this holiday.
[02/15/18, 11:11:28 AM] <KITKATZCAT> so Tal's past romance life is a bad Hallmark movie??
[02/15/18, 11:11:32 AM] <misssunflower94> I love you, chat
[02/15/18, 11:11:32 AM] <DC_Canary13> i kinda forgot to make valentines gifts for my friends. woops
[02/15/18, 11:11:34 AM] <artistsomeday> I was also that anti valentine teen but I was also anti human so no one but me got hurt.

[02/15/18, 11:12:30 AM] <harberst> @japenrose So instead of a valentine's snail you get visited by a valentine's hedgehog?
[02/15/18, 11:12:30 AM] <CharacterStigma> LUL
[02/15/18, 11:12:33 AM] <UncleOok> (with his lovely wife Britney?)

[02/15/18, 11:12:40 AM] <misssunflower94> He's with the lovely wife (trademark)
[02/15/18, 11:12:40 AM] <GnomeArbilz> Addicted to Spuds? tinytatoPotato tinytatoHeart
[02/15/18, 11:12:40 AM] <japenrose> @harberst You could say that?
[02/15/18, 11:12:40 AM] <The_TBoyce> "Other obligations" is an interesting euphemism for "wife". :D
[02/15/18, 11:12:41 AM] <cinphoria> You know, we literally just came over here from Erika playing Dream Daddy, with all the dad jokes, dating goth dad, and now we're here getting potato puns made at us by the real life goth dad.
[02/15/18, 11:12:43 AM] <vexelghost> Quite the potato pun mashups.
[02/15/18, 11:12:45 AM] <runningfool11> Oh lordy
[02/15/18, 11:12:46 AM] <Scroblo> love obligations coolLOVE

[02/15/18, 11:13:04 AM] <Smarcey> I just assume he’s with his lovely wife, Brittany.
[02/15/18, 11:13:08 AM] <mangyforestcat> damn
[02/15/18, 11:13:09 AM] <phoenixgoth> @cinphoria best valentine's day? best valentine's day.
[02/15/18, 11:13:09 AM] <ToonEzon> hey guys, fun tip:instead of wasting up to $10 on a shitty one time use card, instead, get the person a comic book, or if its a holiday, a holiday related one (christmas/holiday issue for christmas, romance for valentines day, etc) and stick a from/to postit on the bag
[02/15/18, 11:13:11 AM] <Smarcey> :p
[02/15/18, 11:13:14 AM] <nuke034> we need more excuses to buy each other food
[02/15/18, 11:13:27 AM] <tomservo544> @stargazer1977 same thing with animals. Cats and dogs specifically. People who hate them are so annoying and idiotic when they feel the need to chime in about how they hate a puppy when everyone else is enjoying it.
[02/15/18, 11:13:30 AM] <owifig> Western CULTURE has a lot of baggage. US culture in particular can never fully escape the puritans.
[02/15/18, 11:13:32 AM] <The_TBoyce> I'm counting the Legend of Korra comics as romance because Korrasami. <3
[02/15/18, 11:13:33 AM] <JordanShiveley> I hope they talk about Gengoroh Tagame!
[02/15/18, 11:13:36 AM] <Darastrygat> But no matter what, you know what they say: "mmmm. facecake." -- @cinphoria

[02/15/18, 11:13:55 AM] <harberst> @ToonEzon I second that, especially if it's a book/comic you know they've been wanting but just haven't gotten for one reason or another.
[02/15/18, 11:13:56 AM] <ToonEzon> a comic and chocolate
[02/15/18, 11:13:56 AM] <cinphoria> @Darastrygat dammit I don't even remember why I said that
[02/15/18, 11:13:58 AM] <goatboi101> why
[02/15/18, 11:13:58 AM] <MissNayoung> My husband is basically Damien from Dream Daddy. Tall, dark, and mysterious and his Valentine's surprises are so much fun.
[02/15/18, 11:14:16 AM] <misssunflower94> Baggage - but different baggage
[02/15/18, 11:14:16 AM] <ThePunkDude> Yo,I'm new here.. was up? :)
[02/15/18, 11:14:21 AM] <goatboi101> nooooooooooooooooo
[02/15/18, 11:14:28 AM] <vexelghost> A comic cover made of chocolate.
[02/15/18, 11:14:32 AM] <phoenixgoth> @ThePunkDude Welcome aboard, friend!
[02/15/18, 11:14:33 AM] <Slippydude> @MissNayoung lucky you!
[02/15/18, 11:14:35 AM] <misssunflower94> @ThePunkDude talking romance comics for the holiday!
[02/15/18, 11:14:37 AM] <mangyforestcat> Doesn't the sexual repression of Japan steer pretty 'young"?
[02/15/18, 11:14:39 AM] <VanTwinblade> @thepunkdude we talkin comic.
[02/15/18, 11:14:41 AM] <owifig> @ThePunkDude Comics!
