[02/16/18, 8:03:00 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green and a guest spend 90 minutes going deeper into a fandom then you may have thought possible. From Magic: The Gathering to Street Fighter weâ€™re examining the stories and worldbuilding that makes these properties so enchanting. The guests and subjects are as varied as can be but the one thing that brings them together is passion.

[02/16/18, 8:03:57 AM] <Sylien_> I've never heard of this show at all. Venture bros?
[02/16/18, 8:03:57 AM] <VermillionCrimson> It's on my bucket list as well.
[02/16/18, 8:04:03 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Is it still on USA Netflix?

[02/16/18, 8:04:08 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Ha, that's funny, I actually use the full word "Venture Brothers". @GeekandSundry First time I've heard just "bros".
[02/16/18, 8:04:13 AM] <JerrodOwex> I have a watch list like that too, its LONG af!
[02/16/18, 8:04:19 AM] <shidareAKI> !whodat
[02/16/18, 8:04:19 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green ( twitter.com/HydroSnail ), with guest Matt Key ( twitter.com/themattkey ).
[02/16/18, 8:04:21 AM] <Sylien_> Hi Key!
[02/16/18, 8:04:21 AM] <frizzyfro21> ðŸ‘Œ
[02/16/18, 8:04:25 AM] <deathboy01> It is a massive parody of Johny Quest
[02/16/18, 8:04:25 AM] <KBTibbs> @imsylien are yoi familiar with Johnny Quest?
[02/16/18, 8:04:26 AM] <Zismarith> Never watched. Meant to. Really.
[02/16/18, 8:04:28 AM] <cabezadecervez> liquid television kicked of beavis and butthead, aeon flux and i believe featured bill plimpton
[02/16/18, 8:04:33 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Oh snap it's Matt
[02/16/18, 8:04:37 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I've watched a handful of Venture Brothers, it's pretty funny.
[02/16/18, 8:04:39 AM] <Andyinsomnia> I have watched 4 or 5 episodes when I have been at my best friends around the time new episodes are out but I've never got around to watching the whole thing. I really should do
[02/16/18, 8:04:40 AM] <Sylien_> @KBTibbs Not at all ?
[02/16/18, 8:04:47 AM] <mikalhaze> beavis and butthead was my gateway drug
[02/16/18, 8:04:51 AM] <Triamas> I didn't know Doctor Strange was in Venture Bros
[02/16/18, 8:04:57 AM] <johnhummel> When I was a kid I loved He-Man and She-Ra. I tried to watch them a year ago with my kids. It - hasn't aged well.
[02/16/18, 8:05:04 AM] <KBTibbs> @imsylien Then there is little common touchstone. Sorry
[02/16/18, 8:05:05 AM] <chaoticloony> I have seen it, but don't like any of the characters. ATHF is more likeable to me!

[02/16/18, 8:05:44 AM] <ieyke> @Triamas I mean...he kinda is. Doctor Orpheus is a really blatant parody version of Strange.
[02/16/18, 8:05:48 AM] <psychogunman1978> can't wait for critical role
[02/16/18, 8:05:51 AM] <stargazer1977> Some Saturday morning cartoons aged better than others, of course Looney Tunes is timeless. But even stuff like Beatlejuice has aged surprisingly well.
[02/16/18, 8:05:52 AM] <vexelghost> @johnhummel No they haven't but at least they taught morals.

[02/16/18, 8:06:19 AM] <Sylien_> @KBTibbs fair enough xD I'm very danish in some things, especially in context of my knowledge of adult humor cartoons, since those aren't really known here.

[02/16/18, 8:06:52 AM] <MissNayoung> Matt was a great pick for this episode considering he does resemble Dr Orpheus to a degree.

[02/16/18, 8:07:27 AM] <ieyke> Real talk, The Venture Bros is one of the best shows EVER made. Like...Top 10 of all time, no contest.

[02/16/18, 8:07:43 AM] <cuzimhood> its alright
[02/16/18, 8:07:44 AM] <MissNayoung> Definitely! Venture Bros is one of those shows that will reeal something early and have a payoff for it a few seasons down the line.
[02/16/18, 8:07:49 AM] <Fu4ow> it's so clever
[02/16/18, 8:07:53 AM] <FuffyButt> i watched it. its not for me
[02/16/18, 8:07:57 AM] <vexelghost> I'm totally keyboard failing today.
[02/16/18, 8:08:12 AM] <chaoticloony> I'm not a fan of Venture Brothers, the characters are all unlikable to me!
[02/16/18, 8:08:12 AM] <KBTibbs> WHICH EPISODE??
[02/16/18, 8:08:21 AM] <stargazer1977> Doctor Girlfriend is a truly great character.

[02/16/18, 8:08:38 AM] <vexelghost> Ryan should do Archer lore.
[02/16/18, 8:08:43 AM] <clover_mouse> Where can you watch Venture bros legally?
[02/16/18, 8:08:53 AM] <Fu4ow> Ryan's tie knots are getting even more fab
[02/16/18, 8:08:54 AM] <KBTibbs> @stargazer1977 you mean Dr. Mrs. The Monarch?

[02/16/18, 8:09:06 AM] <ieyke> Venture Bros gets better and better the longer it goes, and the whole series gets better and better with every new episode. New episodes make old episodes better. The depth and complexity of the series is BONKERS
[02/16/18, 8:09:08 AM] <Danoba> @FuffyButt Oh I did, in real time.

[02/16/18, 8:14:12 AM] <LizForkin> the henchman becoming more predominate characters in later seasons was wonderful
[02/16/18, 8:14:18 AM] <YebbaDebba> I agree!
[02/16/18, 8:14:18 AM] <cuzimhood> can you explain the premise of the show and the characters? kind of just dove in here without giving the audience something to grasp
[02/16/18, 8:14:31 AM] <HessianX> Would like more seasons though Kappa

[02/16/18, 8:14:54 AM] <stargazer1977> @Chix_with_Joystix agreed Liz, especially because they are pretty much the only really likeable people in the show, lol. Their bosses are total assholes. :)
[02/16/18, 8:15:02 AM] <KBTibbs> Yeah, they've managed to cram 5 seasons of tv into 10 years.
