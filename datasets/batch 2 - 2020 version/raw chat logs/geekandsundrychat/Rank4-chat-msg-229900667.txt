[02/17/18, 1:00:42 PM] <stargazer1977> I don't even know what our Prom theme was since I didn't have a date to go. But they didn't do movie themes for ours. Too conservative and traditional where I'm from.

[02/17/18, 1:09:40 PM] <cinphoria> @misssunflower94 I dunno I think he's just been an accessory after the fact many, many times.

[02/17/18, 1:10:20 PM] <cinphoria> tako tako taco >.>
[02/17/18, 1:10:23 PM] <stargazer1977> I have to be honest, I'm fine with people making Valentine's Day what they want. But I'll never make it anything but Romantic Love because we don't have any other holidays about that. And regardless of the commercial takeover of every holiday, romantic love is also important to the human experience for most people.
[02/17/18, 1:10:24 PM] <Little_Tito> But I'll take the doggo though.
[02/17/18, 1:10:26 PM] <halfaringcircus> I've watched way more Hatoful Boyfriend than any sane person.
[02/17/18, 1:10:26 PM] <OceanicPicon815> is Shield of Tomorrow playing again after this?
