[02/21/18, 8:09:26 AM] <Barbadikus> I know none of these people.
[02/21/18, 8:09:27 AM] <stargazer1977> Cloud and Aerith were never a couple.

[02/21/18, 8:10:16 AM] <Triamas> no Nate and Elena from Uncharted?
[02/21/18, 8:10:16 AM] <MeggieMay328> why someone wants to date their windows 10 computer.... ;)
[02/21/18, 8:10:17 AM] <stargazer1977> Yeah, Locke and Celes was my choice for that poll.

[02/21/18, 8:10:49 AM] <cardinaliron> do you like horror in your sexy?
[02/21/18, 8:11:02 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Sexy Horror with Taliesin and Becca sounds like it needs to be a spin off show
[02/21/18, 8:11:03 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> #SexyHorror should be the name of a Twitch Room in chat.
[02/21/18, 8:11:03 AM] <Safdocter> thats not possible
[02/21/18, 8:11:05 AM] <JeffM0307> :P
[02/21/18, 8:11:09 AM] <Paladin356> oh snap
[02/21/18, 8:11:16 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Omg
[02/21/18, 8:11:21 AM] <Shadowner> 90k people is a lot of words per second
[02/21/18, 8:11:31 AM] <ThatOneGuy1989> Maybe now the Dragons can actually win a game
[02/21/18, 8:11:31 AM] <EricaTheStrange> A Squee room for whenever anyone wants to relieve a loud Erika moment
[02/21/18, 8:11:50 AM] <Zismarith> @PipersTwin Oh man, last night . . .
[02/21/18, 8:11:51 AM] <BGarnier> lol

[02/21/18, 8:11:58 AM] <Ossborn> I have no problems reading the CR chat <cough> 2nd rebroadcast <cough>
[02/21/18, 8:11:58 AM] <stargazer1977> She is not ranked one of the best players in the world. She might crack the top 10 of South Korea.
[02/21/18, 8:12:00 AM] <BGarnier> ðŸ¤” indeed
[02/21/18, 8:12:05 AM] <EricaTheStrange> lol @Zismarith
[02/21/18, 8:12:05 AM] <Sylien_> Erika's face gives me life
[02/21/18, 8:12:15 AM] <Chovexani> O.o
[02/21/18, 8:12:16 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> A Squee Room might be a kind of #sexyhorror
[02/21/18, 8:12:24 AM] <stargazer1977> I agree that representation is nice, but it's still a sport and talent matters.
[02/21/18, 8:12:31 AM] <BGarnier> D:
[02/21/18, 8:12:38 AM] <Triamas> bah, anyone can be a president these days, even some reality tv host
[02/21/18, 8:12:39 AM] <Compel_Bast> That'd... actually sound kinda fun
[02/21/18, 8:12:40 AM] <Chovexani> Guys John Oliver basically said Erika is America, did anyone else see this?
[02/21/18, 8:12:46 AM] <mmatton> Booby traps wasn't salacious?
[02/21/18, 8:12:49 AM] <ghosthack159> ...not riding a unicorn?
[02/21/18, 8:12:51 AM] <Zismarith> Barbie's Dream House will include a panic room and hi-tech security system.
[02/21/18, 8:12:57 AM] <krZQQ> holy neck vein

[02/21/18, 8:13:02 AM] <Fu4ow> @stargazer1977 let's agree that a single female player is real bad though
[02/21/18, 8:13:17 AM] <Compel_Bast> meh, it's no Nightwing statue
[02/21/18, 8:13:19 AM] <JeffM0307> Yeah! Equality!
[02/21/18, 8:13:22 AM] <Chovexani> Heck yeah
[02/21/18, 8:13:24 AM] <scholartist> monkaS I mean FailFish

[02/21/18, 8:13:28 AM] <MeggieMay328> well the overwatch player in question is suppose to be true top tier - they aren't picking out random players
[02/21/18, 8:13:28 AM] <captain_narava> As god intended
[02/21/18, 8:13:32 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Amen, Erika.
[02/21/18, 8:13:32 AM] <scholartist> Whatever, I apparently can't meme EleGiggle
[02/21/18, 8:13:36 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> And now we understand Erika's platform for getting elected to everything.

[02/21/18, 8:13:43 AM] <stargazer1977> @Fu4ow I don't care about forced demographics for sports. If not enough females are able to compete with the males, make a female league.
[02/21/18, 8:13:47 AM] <MeggieMay328> one team said they wouldn't look at her because they used a dorm? really?!
[02/21/18, 8:13:48 AM] <Shadowner> ...yeah, that happened
