[02/22/18, 11:08:09 AM] <JeffM0307> Amy is good at mapping
[02/22/18, 11:08:09 AM] <misssunflower94> Amy you are magical
[02/22/18, 11:08:11 AM] <halfaringcircus> @Stormaggeden Just because I'm picturing little baby in chat.
[02/22/18, 11:08:11 AM] <meaningofnightt> Amy's mapmaking skill is well known
[02/22/18, 11:08:14 AM] <DeLevely> this looks like a dungeon map tho
[02/22/18, 11:08:16 AM] <KBTibbs> Yay! Amy's crazy conspiracy theory scratchings!
[02/22/18, 11:08:17 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Good job amy
[02/22/18, 11:08:17 AM] <The_TBoyce> Anyone else introduced to Fables by The Wolf Among Us? *raises hand*
[02/22/18, 11:08:19 AM] <misssunflower94> #ThankYouTWC
[02/22/18, 11:08:19 AM] <crthemighty> TIL wolf among us is a part of fables
[02/22/18, 11:08:20 AM] <owifig> Yet her King's Quest II map is on a piece of old mail...
[02/22/18, 11:08:24 AM] <igilboa1> Amy. You understand that that looks like the scrabblings of a half-unhinged time traveler.
[02/22/18, 11:08:26 AM] <KBTibbs> @meaningofnightt Black ink!
[02/22/18, 11:08:27 AM] <Crocopotalion> My interest decreased greatly after Bill Willingham chose to act like a sexist jerk.
[02/22/18, 11:08:28 AM] <axe_lobo_galen> Hello i am here and slightly loopy from being sick but yay wednesday!
[02/22/18, 11:08:33 AM] <cinphoria> Wait, Wolf Among Us is part of Fables?!
[02/22/18, 11:08:33 AM] <CharacterStigma> BlessRNG Did her Homework
[02/22/18, 11:08:35 AM] <darkofnate> Slightly less confusing than Amy's Kings Quest map
[02/22/18, 11:08:36 AM] <stargazer1977> I totally approve of this complex mathematics looking chart. <3
[02/22/18, 11:08:39 AM] <Smarcey> wait this is where Wolf Among us Comes form? my mind is blown
[02/22/18, 11:08:41 AM] <tortugadelmar> Damn, evolutionary biologists would be proud of this timeline
[02/22/18, 11:08:43 AM] <vexelghost> Can't make it out. Looks Uncharted. :p
[02/22/18, 11:08:46 AM] <Stormaggeden> that chart is great
[02/22/18, 11:08:46 AM] <BedpanJiggyBones> NERD ALERT!
[02/22/18, 11:08:48 AM] <misssunflower94> @igilboa1 is Amy NOT a half-unhinged time traveler?
[02/22/18, 11:08:51 AM] <meaningofnightt> @KBTibbs we'll have to remind her tomorrow
[02/22/18, 11:08:53 AM] <stargazer1977> Yes, Wolf Among Us is a part of the Fables universe.
[02/22/18, 11:08:54 AM] <Chovexani> @DeLevely Hey Sam-san, whatchoo drawing duder?
[02/22/18, 11:08:55 AM] <DeLevely> "failed" attempts
[02/22/18, 11:08:59 AM] <BeelzeBee> Nobody is cooler than Amy.
[02/22/18, 11:09:01 AM] <aleph_sharp> I wasnt actually sure whether you were going to be talking about the specific series or just general fables and fairytale comics
[02/22/18, 11:09:03 AM] <ravensburgermaster> damn, 150 issues in 13 years?
[02/22/18, 11:09:03 AM] <engineerbudy> hi everyone

[02/22/18, 11:09:09 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> that FABLES map looks kinda similar to the map of King's Quest II
[02/22/18, 11:09:10 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @engineerbudy
[02/22/18, 11:09:11 AM] <mogodontsocialize> Woot Fables :)

[02/22/18, 11:09:24 AM] <DeLevely> @Chovexani I started a warmup drawing the other day, and it kinda turned into a drawing-I-put-effort-into :D
[02/22/18, 11:09:25 AM] <chaoticloony> I love how passionate you guys are!
[02/22/18, 11:09:25 AM] <cinphoria> @ravensburgermaster that's slightly fewer than 1 issue per month
[02/22/18, 11:09:26 AM] <Capencowl> not a great idea XD
[02/22/18, 11:09:31 AM] <ModernChow> I want to draw like James Jean, one day soon!
[02/22/18, 11:09:33 AM] <geekmomma3> Holy shit! I got the video game for my b-day & didn't realize it was related to this comic series!!
[02/22/18, 11:09:35 AM] <philbe63> Does anyone know what Taliesin's shirt is from?
[02/22/18, 11:09:38 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Taliesin and Amy are cool nerds.
