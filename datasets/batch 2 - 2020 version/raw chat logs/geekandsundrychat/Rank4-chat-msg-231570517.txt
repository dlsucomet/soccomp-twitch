[02/22/18, 1:36:09 PM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> oh the chaos begins.
[02/22/18, 1:36:11 PM] <Zismarith> Since Becca is GM tonight, she doesn't really win or lose. Which means the delay is her trying to find a way to win.
[02/22/18, 1:36:14 PM] <Therealwyldride> Weirdly I get Critical Role notifications on YouTube.
[02/22/18, 1:36:14 PM] <Holrend> Hey Chat!

[02/22/18, 1:40:48 PM] <ToonEzon> is this just within the sol system? or are we dealing with a type 2 civ?
[02/22/18, 1:40:50 PM] <Danoba> @harberst Well as fun as that was for chat, it had its moment.
[02/22/18, 1:40:51 PM] <Srucher> !rbschedule
[02/22/18, 1:40:55 PM] <Andyinsomnia> !wtfisthis
[02/22/18, 1:40:55 PM] <Nightbot> Weave Society is the RPG tale for the digital age. Storytellers Amy Dallen, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, Stef Woodburn, and Gina DeVivo come together to jump into one of the many fantastical worlds of Weave. Where will they end up next?
[02/22/18, 1:40:57 PM] <DeLevely> is Becca aware that Amy is in charge of space?
[02/22/18, 1:40:58 PM] <JSGauss> Elon Musk's head in a jar

[02/22/18, 1:42:15 PM] <shidareAKI> @DeLevely the final and best frontier
[02/22/18, 1:42:36 PM] <Zismarith> @harberst I suspect that what with the 3 cams and the phone app image in between, there simply isn't room for yet another screen image.
[02/22/18, 1:42:52 PM] <cardinaliron> Becca is GM (God Mode)
