[02/23/18, 8:01:59 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green and a guest spend 90 minutes going deeper into a fandom then you may have thought possible. From Magic: The Gathering to Street Fighter we’re examining the stories and worldbuilding that makes these properties so enchanting. The guests and subjects are as varied as can be but the one thing that brings them together is passion.
[02/23/18, 8:02:01 AM] <chaoticloony> Lore me Sempai!

[02/23/18, 8:04:10 AM] <chaoticloony> @DeLevely Hi Sam!
[02/23/18, 8:04:19 AM] <ArisBranwin> Oooh survival horror
[02/23/18, 8:04:28 AM] <JeffM0307> @DeLevely Hey, Sam
[02/23/18, 8:04:29 AM] <shidareAKI> @DeLevely I don't think that Ryan is capable of a bad "look".
[02/23/18, 8:04:37 AM] <Slippydude> I miss seing Ivan on stream!!!
[02/23/18, 8:04:44 AM] <rabid_wench> hahaha "swaggering undead"
[02/23/18, 8:04:45 AM] <DeLevely> Hey crew!
[02/23/18, 8:04:46 AM] <Slippydude> @shidareAKI I concur
[02/23/18, 8:04:47 AM] <Mardock007> <3
[02/23/18, 8:04:57 AM] <ArisBranwin> So would infected tacos make undead zombie taco brain eaters?
[02/23/18, 8:05:05 AM] <DeLevely> I'm only here for a little while before I leave, but I'm gonna listen a chat a bit while I draw
[02/23/18, 8:05:06 AM] <Nightbot> Download the new Critical Role theme song for Campaign Two! http://itunes.apple.com/album/id1331550250?ls=1&app=itunes Sales of the song support the musician, Jason Charles Miller.
[02/23/18, 8:05:06 AM] <potterboi111> Hey @delevely
[02/23/18, 8:05:15 AM] <shidareAKI> Hmmm that would be a fun Halloween food. "Brains" tacos
[02/23/18, 8:05:29 AM] <HarpoonTheMoon> i thought that was a vampire movie lol....
[02/23/18, 8:05:29 AM] <Saraphys> Hey Commander @DeLevely :)
[02/23/18, 8:05:36 AM] <starpilotsix> Slow zombies are terrifying because you can imagine potentially dealing with it. Fast zombies, my mind instantly goes "Oh, okay, here's exactly where I die," but with slow zombies I'm forced to imagine being in that situation and trying to make my way out of it, because I MIGHT be able to do it, it'd just be terrifying.
[02/23/18, 8:05:37 AM] <Triamas> @DeLevely what are you drawing right now?
[02/23/18, 8:05:37 AM] <GreenishPtero> Cow brain tacos are tasty
[02/23/18, 8:05:48 AM] <Nijaansh> Hello everyone gandsRyanHype

[02/23/18, 8:06:09 AM] <Nijaansh> How're you :) @chaoticloony
[02/23/18, 8:06:16 AM] <ArisBranwin> So which zombies are scarier? Resident evil zombies? Romero zombies? Or walking dead zombies?
[02/23/18, 8:06:18 AM] <Triamas> @DeLevely sounds cool :)
[02/23/18, 8:06:20 AM] <raja012> yeah fast zombies freak me out.
[02/23/18, 8:06:23 AM] <DeLevely> "The apocalyptic state" so...New Jersey?
[02/23/18, 8:06:24 AM] <chaoticloony> @Nijaansh Ok, and yourself?
[02/23/18, 8:06:26 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> #newb what is raif?
[02/23/18, 8:06:28 AM] <Nijaansh> brb
[02/23/18, 8:06:40 AM] <Nijaansh> im fine ty! @chaoticloony
[02/23/18, 8:06:41 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> raid*
[02/23/18, 8:06:50 AM] <potterboi111> @delevely you’re amazing and always love when you’re in chat
[02/23/18, 8:06:50 AM] <Woolly_Massacre> whoop whoop this is the sound of the police!!
[02/23/18, 8:06:59 AM] <JTap121> Is it blurry and lower quality for anyone else?
[02/23/18, 8:07:03 AM] <DeLevely> Zombies aren't characters, narratively. Zombies are a natural disaster
[02/23/18, 8:07:04 AM] <shidareAKI> I figure that as long as zombies are slow and dumb, they aren't scary. But if they move quickly and strategically that's a whole other level of nop.
[02/23/18, 8:07:08 AM] <DeLevely> @potterboi111 Aww, thank you!
[02/23/18, 8:07:11 AM] <ArisBranwin> Boring zombies? Original RE would like to have a brain with you
[02/23/18, 8:07:12 AM] <raja012> walking dead because when you die everyone becomes zombies
[02/23/18, 8:07:14 AM] <chaoticloony> @Loyalbluefox28 Raids are when one channel sends its viewers to another channel!
[02/23/18, 8:07:23 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> ooooooooo
[02/23/18, 8:07:25 AM] <Nijaansh> !commands
[02/23/18, 8:07:25 AM] <Nightbot> Nijaansh -> The bot commands for this channel are available at https://beta.nightbot.tv/t/geekandsundry/commands
[02/23/18, 8:07:25 AM] <crthemighty> sorry i'm late, we talkin zombies? neat!
[02/23/18, 8:07:29 AM] <KBTibbs> Zombies are the inevitability of death. Their interest is in the psychological pressure they impose, not themselves.
[02/23/18, 8:07:41 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @crthemighty
[02/23/18, 8:07:42 AM] <Nijaansh> !clock
[02/23/18, 8:07:43 AM] <Nightbot> It is currently Thursday 4:07 PM at the Geek & Sundry studio in California.
[02/23/18, 8:07:45 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> the problem is zombies are pretty unstoppable, even if they are slow, they keep coming.
[02/23/18, 8:07:55 AM] <crthemighty> howdy loony
[02/23/18, 8:08:07 AM] <ArisBranwin> I’m waiting for someone to do zombie ninjas
[02/23/18, 8:08:30 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> you shoot it, it keeps coming. you chop off its legs, it crawls on hands. chop off their legs and arms, the use their jaw to move... they simply don't stop.
[02/23/18, 8:08:33 AM] <crthemighty> the fun part of zombie stories isnt the zombies, it's the dealing with the aftermath
[02/23/18, 8:08:33 AM] <potterboi111> @delevely no problems you are always a delight on any show you’re in on here
[02/23/18, 8:08:39 AM] <CrashTestGremlin> can you do all of them at once?
[02/23/18, 8:08:40 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> @chaoticloony so then people went from this one .
[02/23/18, 8:08:52 AM] <Deep_Treble> Zombie ninjas is an oxymoron though
[02/23/18, 8:08:52 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> to another or give versa?
[02/23/18, 8:08:54 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @arisbranwin That would actually make zombie horror interesting. XD
[02/23/18, 8:09:12 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @arisbranwin perhaps zombie nijas ALREADY exist... we just havn't detected them
[02/23/18, 8:09:18 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> is it thursday yet?
[02/23/18, 8:09:34 AM] <potterboi111> @littlepinkbowser YEP
[02/23/18, 8:09:36 AM] <chaoticloony> @Loyalbluefox28 One of the hosts on this channel, Amy ended her stream and sent the people watching her over here.
[02/23/18, 8:09:42 AM] <theneatestburrito> Indeed it is.
[02/23/18, 8:09:45 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> yes yes it is!!!! finalky!
[02/23/18, 8:09:47 AM] <sagebrush72> When is critical role
[02/23/18, 8:09:53 AM] <shidareAKI> !wheniscr
[02/23/18, 8:09:54 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role is on at 7 PM PST on Thursdays, it is currently 4:09 PM PST on Thursday. There is 2 Hours, 50 Minutes, 7 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 804 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[02/23/18, 8:09:54 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> ooooooo
[02/23/18, 8:10:02 AM] <AnicientBolt> @jimmy_eat_meatloaf So you're saying they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming? :P
[02/23/18, 8:10:05 AM] <HarpoonTheMoon> 3 hours till critical role
[02/23/18, 8:10:06 AM] <postdataest> http://www.wheniscriticalrole.com/ <<< Critical Role countdown clock (as well as other links) at this site. @sagebrush72
[02/23/18, 8:10:09 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> 50 minutes I guess
[02/23/18, 8:10:13 AM] <potterboi111> !criticalrole
[02/23/18, 8:10:19 AM] <kolbeee> gandsGandsBeardedMen
[02/23/18, 8:10:25 AM] <Barnstormr> WOO! Its Ivan!
[02/23/18, 8:10:32 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I think post apocalyptic zombie kind of things were kind of unappealing. I know I would NEVER be able to survive in a world where people are reduced to basic instincts, I'm too dependent on technology. XD
[02/23/18, 8:10:36 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> oh wait I'm in central
[02/23/18, 8:10:40 AM] <raja012> haha they do seem to keep coming
[02/23/18, 8:11:04 AM] <ShinyKiiwii> Outlast is the only horror game that won't give you weapons. You have limited batteries, a camera and that's it.
[02/23/18, 8:11:12 AM] <ShinyKiiwii> That's why I love it so much.
[02/23/18, 8:11:20 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> zombies are the not scifi zerg
[02/23/18, 8:11:33 AM] <ladywinde> aw i loved warm bodies
[02/23/18, 8:11:36 AM] <potterboi111> Thoughts on outlast as a survival horror game
[02/23/18, 8:11:46 AM] <chaoticloony> @Loyalbluefox28 Raids are a good way to introduce your viewers to new channels. A raid from Erika's stream introduced me to the fabulous CaveGeekArt channel!
[02/23/18, 8:11:48 AM] <HarpoonTheMoon> Hopefully walking dead is good again soon
[02/23/18, 8:11:52 AM] <potterboi111> I can’t play it in the dark
[02/23/18, 8:11:56 AM] <ShinyKiiwii> @potterboi111 Love it. Would play again.
[02/23/18, 8:12:12 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> walking dead turns its characters
[02/23/18, 8:12:13 AM] <DeLevely> You can humanize what zombies *had* been, but you don't humanize what they become
[02/23/18, 8:12:15 AM] <InventoryFullPT> Would anyone else count The Borg as Zomboes?
[02/23/18, 8:12:17 AM] <KBTibbs> It's interesting that zombies made the jump from fantasy to sci-fi (they used to be exclusively magic based, now they're virus or technology)
[02/23/18, 8:12:19 AM] <harberst> Uh, I see your lack of "humanized zombies" and would like to point out. IZombie
[02/23/18, 8:12:32 AM] <potterboi111> @shinykiiwii yes agreed it is a great game and would play again
[02/23/18, 8:12:33 AM] <ArisBranwin> I remember those zombie romance books
[02/23/18, 8:12:34 AM] <crthemighty> i still have a zombie story i want to write
[02/23/18, 8:12:35 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> ooooooooo OK thanks for the explanation @chaoticloony
[02/23/18, 8:12:44 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> nazi zombies.
[02/23/18, 8:12:46 AM] <Slippydude> And Nazi Zombies
[02/23/18, 8:12:49 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> master D?
[02/23/18, 8:12:51 AM] <Triamas> "I am Legend" did it a little bit, although were those zombies..?
[02/23/18, 8:12:51 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> and robots
[02/23/18, 8:12:55 AM] <RedwoodCoast> What about Shaun of the dead??
[02/23/18, 8:12:59 AM] <ArisBranwin> And I know Felicia talked about one on Vaginal Fantasy
[02/23/18, 8:13:06 AM] <renson_arcalian> I must be one of the few who dislike zombies
[02/23/18, 8:13:09 AM] <KBTibbs> (Sorry Philip)
[02/23/18, 8:13:12 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> we are also allowed to kill each other
[02/23/18, 8:13:14 AM] <ShinyKiiwii> @potterboi111 Haven't been able to play the second game. I want to play it but I'm not a fan of a tentacle woman chasing me through out the game.
[02/23/18, 8:13:14 AM] <DeLevely> "They were once us, they are now shells of us..." is he talking about the zombies or the Nazis?
[02/23/18, 8:13:18 AM] <Nightbot> hortabelmi -> Only those that we deem worthy shall possess the power of the Hyperlink [warning]
[02/23/18, 8:13:26 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> I don't like the zombie genre either, @renson_arcalian
[02/23/18, 8:13:28 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> we can also kill aliens
[02/23/18, 8:13:29 AM] <WesArby> @delevely Oh dear...
[02/23/18, 8:13:31 AM] <Jmissle> BOO
[02/23/18, 8:13:33 AM] <MoebiusX83> the horror in zombie movies is usually from the humans behaviour not the zombies lol
[02/23/18, 8:13:35 AM] <ArisBranwin> @delevely why not both?
[02/23/18, 8:13:40 AM] <chaoticloony> @DeLevely Hehhehehhe, well said!
[02/23/18, 8:13:44 AM] <potterboi111> @delevely my thoughts too
[02/23/18, 8:13:47 AM] <KBTibbs> @LittlePinkBowser But it's hard.... stupid XCom
[02/23/18, 8:13:49 AM] <Saraphys> oooo...burn! @DeLevely :D lol
[02/23/18, 8:13:50 AM] <crthemighty> also, i know ryan had to steal that shirt, because he is too dapper to closet cosplay joel :P
[02/23/18, 8:13:57 AM] <Jmissle> like a ghost
[02/23/18, 8:13:58 AM] <XiphiqiX> Zombies are more advanced intellectually. No racism, everyone is equal great team work.....
[02/23/18, 8:14:05 AM] <Damon_fyrian> I have a novel that consists of short stories about zombies. One of my favorites is one about a pill that effectively temporarily turns you into a zombie.
[02/23/18, 8:14:12 AM] <scifichicx> Guys, I worked your twitch launch and I'm so impressed at the quality and caliber of work that has come out of this channel. A+++
[02/23/18, 8:14:14 AM] <Triamas> "are we the baddies..?"
[02/23/18, 8:14:26 AM] <ArisBranwin> Although house of the dead zombies were insane
[02/23/18, 8:14:36 AM] <LittlePinkBowser> @XiphiqiX its like how progressive the mongol empire was
[02/23/18, 8:14:47 AM] <ArisBranwin> And Marvel zombies was odd
[02/23/18, 8:14:55 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> so... the borg is basically alien nazi robot zombies. they wrap up all the enemy architypes into one
