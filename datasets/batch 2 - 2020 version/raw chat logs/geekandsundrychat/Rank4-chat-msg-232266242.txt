[02/24/18, 7:05:25 AM] <Intoxable> Correct, you do not need anything to look at lasers either, it's condensed heat in a beam that cannot go outside its projected paragon
[02/24/18, 7:05:30 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> IT's also a MUCH smaller amount of light
[02/24/18, 7:05:52 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Well that's obvious. Infinity Stones are pure, raw power older than the universe.

[02/24/18, 7:09:30 AM] <Intoxable> very few things can penetrate the hulks skin
[02/24/18, 7:09:33 AM] <RicketyCat> fuel consumption equations do take curvature into account
[02/24/18, 7:09:34 AM] <PhoenixBlue0> In answer to that question: Yes. That's why flights between the U.S. and Europe go over Iceland.
[02/24/18, 7:09:36 AM] <stacheman> Earth is flat tho
[02/24/18, 7:09:37 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> The earth's curvature compared to a flight path is so miniscule it's practically millimeters of adjustment.
[02/24/18, 7:09:40 AM] <RealMicah> QUESTION: Could a Jedi be killed by a sniper firing a solid projectile from a range beyond their ability to perceive incoming threats?
[02/24/18, 7:10:17 AM] <Slippydude> You're forgetting that the plane would have to use more energy to change altitiude
[02/24/18, 7:10:44 AM] <Slippydude> Gravity would keep them at the same Elevation until more lift force was introduced into the system

[02/24/18, 7:15:02 AM] <Jtxdesertrat> Why do pickles have bumps? Is it from when they had limbs and were our overlords?

[02/24/18, 7:15:12 AM] <vexelghost> @steelneko 1 Squirrel Girl. :p
[02/24/18, 7:15:48 AM] <Aquilus_Prime> WIth the first method i think it more likely relies on an outside forward impetus. It would theoretically be using the earth's geomagnetic field as the required magnetic field once he is over water he no longer has a solid surface to generate forward thrust.
[02/24/18, 7:16:02 AM] <steelneko> @PauladinWon Well yes, obviously, but when she's out of range. ;)

[02/24/18, 7:16:47 AM] <RealMicah> He remembers my name? Oh dear.
[02/24/18, 7:16:58 AM] <anthropomorphicdog> the force has no outer limit, it's whether the jedi is paying attention to that particular event, or if the event is enough to modify the force balance
[02/24/18, 7:17:28 AM] <RicketyCat> QUESTION: (simple question o.0) In neurochemical signal position and direction, is it more correct to use equations similar to electrical signals in wire or can simplified Psi (density probabilities) be used?
[02/24/18, 7:17:38 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Of course they could, because the Force automatically guides them, that's the design. Not scientific per say, but...
[02/24/18, 7:17:56 AM] <RealMicah> I love Kyle. <3
[02/24/18, 7:18:01 AM] <Monarch14> How did you decide on the marker and clear board setup, and have you considered mirroring the video to make writing easier?
[02/24/18, 7:18:02 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> LOL that's complicated
[02/24/18, 7:18:17 AM] <YuriKitten> Swamp Thing is inherently magical...

[02/24/18, 7:18:24 AM] <FandHC> is this guy Thor's brother? :O

[02/24/18, 7:18:45 AM] <Blood_Dragon17> QUESTION: In regards to Sci-Fi faster than light propulsion Systems which form is the most probable for use in the not too distant future
[02/24/18, 7:18:48 AM] <RicketyCat> symbiosys nor hybrid
[02/24/18, 7:18:50 AM] <CharacterStigma> Question: What are methods of improving memory without harmful items or consumables?
[02/24/18, 7:19:01 AM] <Intoxable> Correct, Swampthing is magic, the 1980's movie is a huge misinterpretation
[02/24/18, 7:19:01 AM] <RicketyCat> *not
[02/24/18, 7:19:03 AM] <Intoxable> good movie though

[02/24/18, 7:19:16 AM] <Slippydude> QUESTION: Where is your plane, from the previous question about the curvature of the earth, getting the extra force to gain altitude as it flies
[02/24/18, 7:19:17 AM] <anthropomorphicdog> is there an epistemic responsibility for any superpowered being to act in a benificial way, or would it require them to act as benignly as possible?
[02/24/18, 7:19:28 AM] <FluxElectro> Kyle is obviously Thor and Jane Foster's love child
[02/24/18, 7:19:46 AM] <Skaven404> Do I really need to take out my ribs to suck my own willie?
[02/24/18, 7:19:55 AM] <Maranoiah> what day does the CR episode go up on geeknsundry website? any1 know?
[02/24/18, 7:19:59 AM] <Intoxable> But they broke up and now Thor pays an Asgard amount of child support, which sucks
[02/24/18, 7:20:00 AM] <Aquilus_Prime> Answer, With life support you could leave Earth's Magneto sphere and be fried by radiation.
