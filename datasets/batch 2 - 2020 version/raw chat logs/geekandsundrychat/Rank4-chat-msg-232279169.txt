[02/24/18, 1:10:10 PM] <ryan_witalison> The NES was my first game system

[02/24/18, 1:10:39 PM] <stargazer1977> The 2600 game that I was the best at was Asteroids, but it was never my favorite. I would just play that when my sisters also wanted to play so I would play long enough for them to give up with wanting a turn, lol.

[02/24/18, 1:11:07 PM] <RealMicah> Atari. First game: Tanks.
[02/24/18, 1:11:10 PM] <chaoticloony> My first console was an Atari 2600
[02/24/18, 1:11:11 PM] <maris_lyn> All the seductive techniques.
[02/24/18, 1:11:12 PM] <YesLittleHummingbird> @Sirenhunter5 I know, honey. I do too ;-; XD

[02/24/18, 1:11:26 PM] <chuckytheclown11> look at all them console
[02/24/18, 1:11:29 PM] <DANfan69> Goldeneye aged poorly? BURN THE HERETIC!
[02/24/18, 1:11:30 PM] <misssunflower94> I would probably be seduced by tetris honestly
[02/24/18, 1:11:33 PM] <YesLittleHummingbird> I'm lame. My first console was the N64 followed by the PS1
[02/24/18, 1:11:37 PM] <cedon> but ya, mario brothers and metroid rulled a LOT of my time back in the day :)
[02/24/18, 1:11:37 PM] <Barbadikus> Atari was the beginning of a brave new world.
[02/24/18, 1:11:38 PM] <ACWraith> I played DOOM on PC so I could never get into Goldeneye's movement.
[02/24/18, 1:11:39 PM] <ALK824> every game from N64 has aged terribly. Come at me.
[02/24/18, 1:11:41 PM] <Sirenhunter5> @YesLittleHummingbird forever wishing to find it XD
[02/24/18, 1:11:44 PM] <harberst> Ah yes the old Disney move SNES games. I sunk waaay to many hours into Aladdin and Lion King.

[02/24/18, 1:11:56 PM] <talewind> my first ~console~ was the wii, but my first ~system~ was the gameboy color
[02/24/18, 1:11:58 PM] <stargazer1977> Mega Man has aged very well, though. Much better than games like GoldenEye have.
[02/24/18, 1:12:05 PM] <B3nSkywalker> First game the okd nintendo duck hunt
[02/24/18, 1:12:06 PM] <sierabravo4> SNES and then PS1. I was so mad because I wanted N64 for the Pokemon games
[02/24/18, 1:12:06 PM] <Sirenhunter5> They should play that terrible E.T. game for shits and giggles
[02/24/18, 1:12:08 PM] <gemanii> JMP i remeber the one combat with tanks planes
[02/24/18, 1:12:09 PM] <YesLittleHummingbird> @Sirenhunter5 We may wind up searching forever XD
