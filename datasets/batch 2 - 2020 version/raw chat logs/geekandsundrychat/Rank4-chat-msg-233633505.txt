[02/28/18, 1:11:59 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Ehh, not a horror movie fan, sorry.
[02/28/18, 1:12:05 PM] <stargazer1977> That joke basically writes itself, lol.
[02/28/18, 1:12:08 PM] <Keiata> Get Out was so good.
[02/28/18, 1:12:16 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Great movie.
[02/28/18, 1:12:20 PM] <ThatNerd> W A K A N D A F O R E V E R
[02/28/18, 1:12:27 PM] <Highfarm73> John_Sparks_Jr not really a horror
[02/28/18, 1:12:33 PM] <Dragonchrome> #BlackPanther/GetOutChallenge
[02/28/18, 1:12:35 PM] ** strous1 has not seen the movie yet so cya later.
[02/28/18, 1:12:37 PM] <stargazer1977> I like Get Out a lot, but my pick for the Oscar is The Shape of Water.
[02/28/18, 1:12:39 PM] <katana_rider> I don't like horror movies. Get Out is not a horror movie go see it
[02/28/18, 1:12:49 PM] <stargazer1977> Get Out is probably my #2 of last year, though.
[02/28/18, 1:13:11 PM] <Highfarm73> stargazer1977 haven't seen that either
[02/28/18, 1:13:19 PM] <Critternation3000> QUESTION can this show come back full-time? you guys are great
[02/28/18, 1:13:19 PM] <Keiata> Get Out is more thriller/suspense.
[02/28/18, 1:13:31 PM] <Alexanderhero83> VOD
[02/28/18, 1:14:03 PM] <stargazer1977> I didn't like Discovery enough to continue with it. Just not what I want from Star Trek.
[02/28/18, 1:14:11 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @Highfarm73 He just described Get Out as a horror movie.
[02/28/18, 1:14:13 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Ahh
[02/28/18, 1:14:36 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Ehh, I barely enjoy movies outside of superhero stuff
[02/28/18, 1:14:43 PM] <chaoticloony> The big question is how many people will stay subscribed now that it is over!
[02/28/18, 1:14:46 PM] <Dragonchrome> !question
[02/28/18, 1:14:54 PM] <Mortem_Interitum> I'm scared to take a look at Discovery, because there's so many different opinions on that show.

[02/28/18, 1:15:09 PM] <EmilytheBard> yeah i am not a huge fan of horror movies, and I have not seen get out yet. i WILL do my absolute best to see it when I can tho
[02/28/18, 1:15:35 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Might need a volume boost, both Twitch/Alpha. I'm at max and it still should be louder.
[02/28/18, 1:15:37 PM] <shidareAKI> Accurate description of Ryan
[02/28/18, 1:15:38 PM] <chaoticloony> I have no problem with spoilers!

[02/28/18, 1:15:53 PM] <stargazer1977> @EmilytheBard it's definitely not a horror movie, but I don't really want to compare it to some other movie so you aren't spoiled. It has a pretty major twist.
[02/28/18, 1:15:54 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Question Who is Black Panther Best Villian in the Comics?
[02/28/18, 1:15:56 PM] <alienkid> I need that wakanda shirt

[02/28/18, 1:16:17 PM] <katana_rider> All I'm saying is that I hate horror movies, so I didn't go see Get Out in theaters, but my best friend convinced me to go see it and I in no way regretted it.
[02/28/18, 1:16:24 PM] <emxo__> hi
[02/28/18, 1:16:33 PM] <cinphoria> welcome, @emxo__
[02/28/18, 1:16:37 PM] <Dragonchrome> Hi @emxo__
[02/28/18, 1:16:50 PM] <AnicientBolt> That was a dope episode of Loremasters
[02/28/18, 1:16:51 PM] <Mosbaked> I think they honored the comics just enough, left out some of the goofier bits that wouldn't play well
[02/28/18, 1:16:59 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> This was such a great scene...
[02/28/18, 1:17:17 PM] <zoeevee> it was beautiful
[02/28/18, 1:17:22 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> :D
[02/28/18, 1:17:23 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry WE HAVE MISSED YOU! :D
[02/28/18, 1:17:27 PM] <RuzgofDI> I loved the video that came out where the director dissected the start of the casino fight.
[02/28/18, 1:17:30 PM] <stargazer1977> !Question: When we talked about Black Panther on AYBGF before you asked me to tell you how it went, because our theater has never showed a predominantly black movie. Even though it wasn't as packed as most Marvel movies are, it still filled up over half of the theater. Even in this deeply conservative very white location.
[02/28/18, 1:17:31 PM] <Dragonchrome> Tonight's Ask Your Black Geek Friend WILL contain spoilers for Black Panther. If you have yet to see the film, watch at your own risk!
[02/28/18, 1:17:32 PM] <Mortem_Interitum> Well...yes, we've missed you!
[02/28/18, 1:17:38 PM] <Aveneg> Never seen this show before but so far it's so awesome :D

[02/28/18, 1:17:43 PM] <sine_nominae> I have missed you so much. Want your show back as a regular thing.
[02/28/18, 1:17:45 PM] <Highfarm73> Klaue laughing when shooting his damn arm gun thing was fun
[02/28/18, 1:17:47 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry I saw it earlier today so I could THIS SHOW LIVE! :D
[02/28/18, 1:17:49 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I see it.
[02/28/18, 1:17:57 PM] <shidareAKI> Japan doesn’t get it until Thursday!
[02/28/18, 1:18:00 PM] <Zismarith> I won't catch it for months, probably Christmas time. I won't remember any of this!
[02/28/18, 1:18:04 PM] <vexelghost> QUESTION: How do you feel about the Black Lightning series in comparison to Black Panther?
[02/28/18, 1:18:09 PM] <shidareAKI> And I can’t see it on Tuesday
[02/28/18, 1:18:17 PM] <shidareAKI> Until I mean

[02/28/18, 1:18:34 PM] <Noblemight> LUL Poor Damien
[02/28/18, 1:18:35 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Spoiler alert
[02/28/18, 1:18:39 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @shidareAKI I didn't know Japan was that far behind on movie releases.
[02/28/18, 1:18:40 PM] <chaoticloony> We still believe in you Damion!
[02/28/18, 1:18:44 PM] <katana_rider> Robert Frost monkaS
[02/28/18, 1:18:55 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Oh, I saw this trailer.
[02/28/18, 1:19:03 PM] <shidareAKI> Yep, we always get movies last @john_sparks_jr
[02/28/18, 1:19:10 PM] <geniespool> Question: its been a popular theory Idris Elba would be the next James bond after Craig. odds on it being chiwitel or Michael b Jordan?
[02/28/18, 1:19:12 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah, I'm still wondering what this is supposed to be. I mean, I hear Marisha, Matt Key, Tal, and a few others.
[02/28/18, 1:19:18 PM] <AnActualManitee> QUESTION: best shuri moment and why is it the "colonizer" moment ?
[02/28/18, 1:19:20 PM] <Dragonchrome> Project Alpha projectalpha.com
[02/28/18, 1:19:37 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @shidareAKI Japan gets them last? Of all places, I'd think Japan would be ON TOP of the tech and entertainment. XD
[02/28/18, 1:19:43 PM] <stargazer1977> @shidareAKI well, you get Japanese movies first, and I envy you that. I love a lot of Japanese cinema, both live and anime.
[02/28/18, 1:19:47 PM] <shidareAKI> I am so exicted for this!!
[02/28/18, 1:19:47 PM] <owifig> That scene in the casino - I couldn't figure out what looked weird about the general other than that she seemed uncomfortable in a wig, until I saw the director discussing the shooting the scene and I realized - in a movie of natural black hair, it's a wig with straightened hair. It's frickin' brilliant!
[02/28/18, 1:19:51 PM] <zoeevee> is it zombies? I can't do zombies :(
[02/28/18, 1:19:57 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Who is in it?

[02/28/18, 1:20:10 PM] <KaiOrAya> did I hear a Sam DeLeve in that?
[02/28/18, 1:20:11 PM] <shidareAKI> @john_sparks_jr that’s not why we get films last. I think it’s a licensing thing
[02/28/18, 1:20:24 PM] <shidareAKI> @kaioraya pretty sure yeag
