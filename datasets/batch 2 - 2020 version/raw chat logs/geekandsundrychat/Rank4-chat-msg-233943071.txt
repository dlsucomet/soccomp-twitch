[03/1/18, 9:12:31 AM] <japenrose> @chaoticloony The nerdy-ass voice actors are also a big pull, indeed
[03/1/18, 9:12:36 AM] <bastienfils> Somewhere in the North, Maybe Nova Scotia
[03/1/18, 9:12:40 AM] <Tokz> because I just checked the # of subscribers of top twich channels

[03/1/18, 9:14:01 AM] <darkofnate> CR is why I came here, but not why I subbed :)

[03/1/18, 9:16:08 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I actually started to read Vampire Hunter D because Tal mentioned that Yoshitaka Amano did the artwork for it. It ain't a comic but they got me reading something :P

[03/1/18, 9:16:23 AM] <chaoticloony> @Jinxtah sure
[03/1/18, 9:16:32 AM] <Jinxtah> Without anyone getting all hot and bothered.
[03/1/18, 9:16:42 AM] <Chovexani> that 'anyway' XD
[03/1/18, 9:17:00 AM] <JeffM0307> Double check when your mom is the only one that says anything
[03/1/18, 9:17:02 AM] <Seditious11> I believe you should be ok @Jinxtah
[03/1/18, 9:17:06 AM] <darkofnate> @Jinxtah Depends on the question, but go for it.
[03/1/18, 9:17:07 AM] <Critternation3000> bet its a toll question
[03/1/18, 9:17:11 AM] <harberst> Apparently she's a Valley Dragon.
[03/1/18, 9:17:14 AM] <Chovexani> ha @JeffM0307
[03/1/18, 9:17:23 AM] <Critternation3000> troll q
[03/1/18, 9:17:29 AM] <The_TBoyce> An Asian dragon? A long?
[03/1/18, 9:17:31 AM] <Jinxtah> So I'm in the process of catching up on Critical Role season 1, and it made me wonder about something. Are there even any other shows of note on this channel, or is critical role pretty much the only thing that pulls in the $$$ and justifies the channel
[03/1/18, 9:17:50 AM] <Jinxtah> Or are there realistically other shows that have thousands of viewers and is as good
[03/1/18, 9:17:56 AM] <harberst> @Jinxtah Watch some things and decide for yourself.
[03/1/18, 9:17:56 AM] <Seditious11> SO many channels of worth
[03/1/18, 9:18:15 AM] <Seditious11> Soz, show*
[03/1/18, 9:18:40 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Is it just me or is the stream a tad on the quiet side?
[03/1/18, 9:18:42 AM] <Seditious11> Let's make that right, shows*
[03/1/18, 9:18:43 AM] <darkofnate> @Jinxtah Good and popular are two different things. I love CR, but there are number of shows here that I like better.
[03/1/18, 9:18:48 AM] <Jinxtah> Well that wasn't what I asked though, harberst. It shouldn't be hard to answer if you're a regular. Critical role pulls in tens of thousands in subs, right. Honest question
[03/1/18, 9:18:57 AM] <The_TBoyce> Something's up with my chat. I can't see any messages. Are my messages getting through?
[03/1/18, 9:19:08 AM] <Danoba> @The_TBoyce Yes.
[03/1/18, 9:19:12 AM] <Jinxtah> Cool, cool @darkofnate What other shows do you prefer
[03/1/18, 9:19:14 AM] <chaoticloony> @Jinxtah there are many fabulous show on the channel, but Critical Role IS the biggest but not the best to me
[03/1/18, 9:19:21 AM] <Leigh574> we have MANY shows of note. all different types to appeals to different tastes
[03/1/18, 9:19:25 AM] <crthemighty> nothing hits the numbers of critrole. but it's not the only show worthwhile here
[03/1/18, 9:19:27 AM] <harberst> @Jinxtah You asked if there was anything else good. "good" is a matter of personal taste.
[03/1/18, 9:19:30 AM] <darkofnate> @Jinxtah Do you think a show is good or worth watching only if thousands of people watch it live?
[03/1/18, 9:19:39 AM] <Critternation3000> hmm imma still take all that shade as a win, definately a troll
[03/1/18, 9:20:02 AM] <swiftfingers> @Jinxtah for many, CR is the gateway drug, then they tend to stay for the other awesome shows and amazing community
[03/1/18, 9:20:05 AM] <darkofnate> @Jinxtah Wednesday Club, Shield of Tomorrow, Gather Your Party. It varies.
