[03/3/18, 8:04:52 AM] <thundercabbage1> unless you're going to require proof of address to give out the code, I don't see why they would gatekeep it anyhow
[03/3/18, 8:05:01 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> in this case PDF also stands for PRetty Darn Fantastic

[03/3/18, 8:08:52 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> I don't think it even has to be comprehensible language
[03/3/18, 8:08:57 AM] <darkofnate> I've been assuming they're all Qs the whole time.
[03/3/18, 8:09:06 AM] <postdataest> !clock Shield of Tomorrow 4 pm Friday Pacific time

[03/3/18, 8:09:16 AM] <Lefty79> "Everyone's born right-handed, only the greatest overcome it."
[03/3/18, 8:09:24 AM] <randy82177> @darkofnate that would make sense
[03/3/18, 8:09:28 AM] <gogt200> Aw jeeze, this episode is called "Shore Leave at Last"? I'm gonna miss a character building episode!

[03/3/18, 8:10:12 AM] <Henchman2121> @darkofnate the creating an advantage mechanic is quasi Q like. You can time travel and everything.

[03/3/18, 8:10:14 AM] <RuzgofDI> Loquatiously?

[03/3/18, 8:10:31 AM] <misroi> Gates was at one of the two Trek cons I went to. She was super awesome and funny. Happy Birthday, Gates!
[03/3/18, 8:10:32 AM] <chaoticloony> Sorry Sam, but i can't watch the access show.

[03/3/18, 8:10:43 AM] <ArisBranwin> It’s what Sam does.
[03/3/18, 8:10:44 AM] <genuinepat> Sam's energy gives me life

[03/3/18, 8:10:59 AM] <darkofnate> @Henchman2121 I mean, the players have been manipulating their character's actions the whole time, so, god-like?
[03/3/18, 8:11:04 AM] <tomservo544> @piperstwin I don’t dislike them
[03/3/18, 8:11:05 AM] <RealHellBob> Ah gotta love Sam :D

[03/3/18, 8:11:10 AM] <Lefty79> @chaoticloony I believe that if you use the passcode "fangirling" you can get 60 days free.
[03/3/18, 8:11:12 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I'm missing our Doctor a lot right now, but I am READY for this
[03/3/18, 8:11:12 AM] <RealMicah> I could not roll them on a board, I could not roll them and see them scored, I could not roll green Dungeon Dice, I could not roll them, ain't I nice?
[03/3/18, 8:11:12 AM] <The_TBoyce> I kind of want to see fan art of the Sally Ride crew on shore leave in these outfits.
[03/3/18, 8:11:21 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> all I can say is I doubt things were very loquacious during Stef's silent retreat
