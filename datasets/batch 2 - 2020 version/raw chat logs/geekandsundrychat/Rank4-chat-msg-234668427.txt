[03/3/18, 1:07:46 PM] <japenrose> THAT'S WHY SHE LOOKS FAMILIAR
[03/3/18, 1:07:48 PM] <7lizardsinacoat> the cyberpunk secret agenda is the eradication of malaria
[03/3/18, 1:07:50 PM] <Fu4ow> hard to believe she hasn't been on before
[03/3/18, 1:07:57 PM] <phoenixgoth> AHHHH, nice to see your face finally, Jessie! Your Alita costume for Erika was wonderful

[03/3/18, 1:09:58 PM] <cy0nknight> Oh, Tron: Legacy is amazing. The soundtrack's by Daft Punk, so that increases the cool factor
[03/3/18, 1:09:59 PM] <arithmetical> Tron Legacy was good

[03/3/18, 1:10:28 PM] <misssunflower94> Fun is what this show is about
[03/3/18, 1:10:29 PM] <RealMicah> "Max Headroom: Freedom. You know, writers have no freedom on TV. One rude suggestion, and the censors are straight on their back. Not on their back in a rude way."

[03/3/18, 1:11:16 PM] <MajorPayneDOF> I paid shadowrun when i was in high school 20+ years ago
[03/3/18, 1:11:20 PM] <artistsomeday> Oh Shadowrun, I miss you
[03/3/18, 1:11:22 PM] <cy0nknight> I watched it with my dad in the theatre when it came out. 3D glasses and everything
[03/3/18, 1:11:25 PM] <arithmetical> DUNKLEZHAN LIVES!
[03/3/18, 1:11:27 PM] <Clankzilla> the shade lol
[03/3/18, 1:11:31 PM] <misssunflower94> Oooooh
[03/3/18, 1:11:32 PM] <RicketyCat> My copy of Blade Runner is still on VHS.
[03/3/18, 1:11:36 PM] <Fu4ow> anyone played Cyberpunk 2020?
[03/3/18, 1:11:36 PM] <skeletalecho> Sam throwing shade
[03/3/18, 1:11:41 PM] <phoenixgoth> Wait, what.
[03/3/18, 1:11:41 PM] <super390> I wish the Shadowrun Corporate Sins cast from Seattle were here.
[03/3/18, 1:11:42 PM] <Fu4ow> or other Mike Pondsmith games?
[03/3/18, 1:11:42 PM] <LavenderTownsGhost> wait is he Wraith?
[03/3/18, 1:11:44 PM] <JerrodOwex> he looks REALLY TALL!
[03/3/18, 1:11:45 PM] <phoenixgoth> Oh we'll find you
[03/3/18, 1:11:46 PM] <Lord_Orick> Your thoughts on Disney Pulled the plug on the next TRON Long awaited movie ?
[03/3/18, 1:11:48 PM] <chaoticloony> Shadowrun is so fabulous! No Corp is the best Corp! #Sinless
[03/3/18, 1:11:48 PM] <harberst> Wait... should we just unoffically call Shadowrun Hacking & Dragons?
[03/3/18, 1:11:49 PM] <Capefoxalix> I know next to nothing of cyberpunk, though i played one session of shadowrun and one session of the sprawl, if that counts
[03/3/18, 1:11:57 PM] <misssunflower94> Eyyyy Weâ€™re Alive!!
[03/3/18, 1:11:58 PM] <Skitler> Hey that's Ashley Barnstormer
[03/3/18, 1:11:59 PM] <JerrodOwex> even without the platforms
[03/3/18, 1:11:59 PM] <phoenixgoth> @LavenderTownsGhost No he's not. Wraith is Alcuin Gersh
[03/3/18, 1:12:09 PM] <CarolineTheGeek> Now I'm thinking about REASON from Snow Crash as a Percy weapon...
[03/3/18, 1:12:11 PM] <zer0cypher> The new Blade Runner is so good!
[03/3/18, 1:12:23 PM] <Karenator42> Nah he's the snooty dude
[03/3/18, 1:12:24 PM] <arithmetical> the new blade runner is amazing
[03/3/18, 1:12:25 PM] <pagerunnerj> 2049 is a relentlessly gorgeous movie.
[03/3/18, 1:12:32 PM] <zer0cypher> I liked the sequal better than the original
[03/3/18, 1:12:38 PM] <starpilotsix> Altered Carbon by Richard K. Morgan (2002) - Now obviously a Netflix series, novel is much better... in a world where everyone has a 'stack' in the back of their head that stores their personalities and lets them be put into new bodies as required, an ex-soldier and mercenary is resleeved on Earth to solve a murder, by the murder victim.
[03/3/18, 1:12:41 PM] <arithmetical> honestly possibly better than the original
[03/3/18, 1:12:41 PM] <misssunflower94> The air quotes around Love Story makes me nervous
[03/3/18, 1:12:43 PM] <squigbiz> It's an actual sequel. Faithful to the original.
[03/3/18, 1:12:48 PM] <super390> POOR IMPULSE CONTROL
