[03/7/18, 8:06:31 AM] <Ossborn> I only ever threw my controller one time... a Spiderman game (cant remember which one), Bossfight against Doctor Octopus
[03/7/18, 8:06:35 AM] <stargazer1977> I've been tempted to go back to Bloodborne even though I already have the Platinum trophy. I love that game so much.
[03/7/18, 8:06:36 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Hehe, you two are silly. :P @GeekandSundry
[03/7/18, 8:06:37 AM] <The_TBoyce> "Betrayal has no expiration date!" LOL
[03/7/18, 8:07:11 AM] <theSilverScarab> yay
[03/7/18, 8:07:39 AM] <VermillionCrimson> On a similar note to SEGA's goof, turns out you can use the demo EXE on the Origin Final Fantasy XV pre-load
[03/7/18, 8:07:39 AM] <The_TBoyce> LOL, Zach.
[03/7/18, 8:07:48 AM] <Andyinsomnia> jcvimHi Barnaby
[03/7/18, 8:07:48 AM] <stargazer1977> Just the campaign to get people to go back to it. But there is also the fact that it's free with PS Plus this week.

[03/7/18, 8:08:20 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> The Dude abides
[03/7/18, 8:08:30 AM] <Professorpirate> it's an effective amplifier for sure
[03/7/18, 8:08:32 AM] <genericmaverick> Aw, Chief, your amour is great.
[03/7/18, 8:08:34 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> The bucket makes audio better because of the sound angling. XD
[03/7/18, 8:08:39 AM] <genericmaverick> Don't let anyone tell you otherwise

[03/7/18, 8:08:46 AM] <Ossborn> stargazer1977 What was that? Bloodborne free on PS plus?
[03/7/18, 8:08:56 AM] <Danoba> @The_TBoyce Indeed.

[03/7/18, 8:11:19 AM] <Ossborn> You are not the target group for this game, Erika ^^
[03/7/18, 8:11:22 AM] <thotheads1981> Not other hunni pop game
[03/7/18, 8:11:29 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Erika wants her #dreamgothdaddy
[03/7/18, 8:11:31 AM] <JeffM0307> Look up the moment from Friday's "Gather Your Party" when Erika rants about VR Porn
[03/7/18, 8:11:31 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> WHAHAHAHAHA

[03/7/18, 8:12:58 AM] <The_TBoyce> Erika did not just use "Italian Stallion" to describe Mario. :D
[03/7/18, 8:13:17 AM] <Yames007> hi all
[03/7/18, 8:13:31 AM] <Andyinsomnia> jcvimHi @Yames007
[03/7/18, 8:13:33 AM] <realzball> Italian Shetland Pony doesn't sound nearly so cool. Also it doesn't rhyme

[03/7/18, 8:14:01 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Oh fucking hell...

[03/7/18, 8:14:35 AM] <super390> Round up the usual scapegoats.
[03/7/18, 8:14:56 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Yep I'm sure that meeting will get cancelled, it's not that type of week for the WH
[03/7/18, 8:14:58 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah, especially talking about a guy who ignores facts.
[03/7/18, 8:15:10 AM] <Yames007> they r just goats
[03/7/18, 8:15:13 AM] <Ossborn> fact based? With Trump? Good luck!
[03/7/18, 8:15:14 AM] <ryan_witalison> No such thing as Facts when it comes to Trumpy
[03/7/18, 8:15:22 AM] <bazdon> usual scapegoat
[03/7/18, 8:15:22 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I think I read this release somewhere.
[03/7/18, 8:15:48 AM] <Yames007> we need more Family Values
[03/7/18, 8:15:49 AM] <VermillionCrimson> The ESRB exists for a reason. Not the developers fault that the parents ignore the ratings.
[03/7/18, 8:15:53 AM] <Sco_> Go ahead and try to take my video games
[03/7/18, 8:16:15 AM] <Yames007> stop give kids drugs
[03/7/18, 8:16:26 AM] <Professorpirate> fun gun stat, incidents of gun related injury and death go down during gun conventions

[03/7/18, 8:16:41 AM] <RuleZeroGaming> please provide where you found those facts
[03/7/18, 8:16:47 AM] <Sco_> Mental health reform >
[03/7/18, 8:16:47 AM] <Fonzie_ponch> Correlation does not equal causation
[03/7/18, 8:16:50 AM] <Yames007> Get the pharmaceutical companies out of our lives
[03/7/18, 8:16:57 AM] <starpilotsix> Now accordian music, that's another story.
[03/7/18, 8:16:58 AM] <VanceKelley> After the mass shooting in Australia in the 90s, did they ban video games to fix the problem? They haven't had any mass shootings since.
[03/7/18, 8:17:07 AM] <Nightbot> @SaintMichaelthePaladin -> Only those that we deem worthy shall possess the power of the Hyperlink [warning]
[03/7/18, 8:17:11 AM] <nlowenherz> bullying is the problem

[03/7/18, 8:17:54 AM] <bazdon> psychological issues are the problem
