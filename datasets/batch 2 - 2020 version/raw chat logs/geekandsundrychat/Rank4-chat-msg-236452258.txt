[03/8/18, 1:33:51 PM] <Nightbot> Weave Society is the RPG tale for the digital age. Storytellers Amy Dallen, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, Stef Woodburn, and Gina DeVivo come together to jump into one of the many fantastical worlds of Weave. Where will they end up next?
[03/8/18, 1:34:01 PM] <Archamedes> The first time I ran xorte the party rescued twin children of the mayor but one was converted to a cyborg and the other wasn‚Äôt and now they‚Äôre poster children for warring factions. It‚Äôs amazing.

[03/8/18, 1:35:33 PM] <Zismarith> @JMPickering I found it on the droid Google Play store.
[03/8/18, 1:35:38 PM] <TheTriscuit> But only the Storyteller needs the physical set
[03/8/18, 1:35:38 PM] <JeffM0307> Gina using Matt Key's 50 newscaster voice. :P
[03/8/18, 1:35:43 PM] <JesseVsTheWorldOfficial> Is she actually English or is she just being silly?
[03/8/18, 1:35:44 PM] <JeffM0307> *50's
[03/8/18, 1:35:48 PM] <chaoticloony> Gina has really been my MVP on here so far!

[03/8/18, 1:35:58 PM] <RealMicah> @TheTriscuit Great, but where can it be found? Google Play? I'll look again.
[03/8/18, 1:35:59 PM] <phoenixgoth> @DungeonMasterVaeris Kate is English.
[03/8/18, 1:36:01 PM] <harberst> @DungeonMasterVaeris Kate is actually english

[03/8/18, 1:36:37 PM] <crthemighty> kate likes to complain that being in the states too long makes her accent weird :D
[03/8/18, 1:36:40 PM] <PFWScott> Or possibly over lunch breaks.
[03/8/18, 1:36:56 PM] <Hemloccoctail> i thought A/Q/K/J1-10 (x9) pardon the bad spelling earlier
[03/8/18, 1:36:57 PM] <Zismarith> @JMPickering Look for the distinctive colors and font.
[03/8/18, 1:36:59 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> it does make her accent turn weird :)
[03/8/18, 1:37:06 PM] <TheTriscuit> @Archamedes Thank you!
[03/8/18, 1:37:13 PM] <JesseVsTheWorldOfficial> Everyone in Mexico said being in the states too long made my Spanish sound funny :‚Äù) so I feel her pain

[03/8/18, 1:39:41 PM] <vexelghost> I'm beginning to feel science fiction is really science prediction.

[03/8/18, 1:40:12 PM] <stargazer1977> @PauladinWon that's one reason why it's also commonly called speculative fiction.
[03/8/18, 1:40:23 PM] <JesseVsTheWorldOfficial> Nightbot is confused again
[03/8/18, 1:40:29 PM] <TheTriscuit> @groove_kev Ask me your questions and I'll clear anything up

[03/8/18, 1:42:13 PM] <stargazer1977> I like the pick up and play aspect of Weave, but in reality I'm more of the Matt Mercer school of DM'ing. I love building a giant world of my own. But that also requires a huge time investment. :)
