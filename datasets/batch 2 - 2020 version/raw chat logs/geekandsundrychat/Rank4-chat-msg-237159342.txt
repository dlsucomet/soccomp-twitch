[03/10/18, 7:04:34 AM] <cinphoria> assuming you had no pain receptors in your finger
[03/10/18, 7:04:34 AM] <Nightbot> More than a bread box. @VegarM23
[03/10/18, 7:04:44 AM] <RealMicah> Larry Niven delved into this topic in 1969 with his essay Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex.

[03/10/18, 7:10:49 AM] <postdataest> Take note that Daylight Saving Time returns to the Pacific time zone this Sunday March 11th at 2 AM.. ..2 AM becomes 3 AM .
[03/10/18, 7:10:56 AM] <postdataest> The NEXT rebroadcast of CR (C2ep9) (the 3rd), should be at what is (for now) a 'regular' CR rb time 11:30pm Friday Pacific time, after live shows end for the day and at the beginning to the weekend schedule.
[03/10/18, 7:10:56 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> I think I prefer Live Kyle over Recorded Kyle
[03/10/18, 7:11:18 AM] <cinphoria> Live Kyle is pretty damn impressive
[03/10/18, 7:11:32 AM] <RealMicah> @cinphoria Indeed
[03/10/18, 7:11:38 AM] <YuriKitten> The X-Man Cannonball would make more sense for that question, @JMPickering
[03/10/18, 7:12:55 AM] <RealMicah> @YuriKitten Not really. They both have an exhaust trail, and fly via propulsion that seems to be similar to chemical rocketry.
[03/10/18, 7:12:56 AM] <Airsoft_Alcatraz> Question if you ever traveled backwards in time and told yourself not to travel back in time would you cancel out yourself from warning your past self
