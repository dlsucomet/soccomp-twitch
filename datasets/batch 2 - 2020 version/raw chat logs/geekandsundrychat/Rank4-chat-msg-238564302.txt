[03/14/18, 7:12:44 AM] <shidareAKI> I want a remake of Balloon Kid.
[03/14/18, 7:12:48 AM] <stargazer1977> There are so many new games coming out that there is literally not enough hours in the day to play them all. There is room for remakes and new games. You don't have to play the remakes if you don't want to. But that doesn't mean its a bad thing.
[03/14/18, 7:12:48 AM] <darkofnate> All games should be available to everyone, so remakes are good things, but they shouldn't be a company's main focus.

[03/14/18, 7:14:25 AM] <stargazer1977> Part of the problem with video games as a medium is it's still so tech dependent. You usually cannot even play an old game. It's worth bringing them back to fill in people's gaming history.
[03/14/18, 7:14:26 AM] <Danoba> @shidareAKI Had it on the Game Boy.
