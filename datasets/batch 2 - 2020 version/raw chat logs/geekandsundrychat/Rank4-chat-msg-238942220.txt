[03/15/18, 12:33:09 PM] <Alexanderhero83> My sister loves rolling status.
[03/15/18, 12:33:29 PM] <Zismarith> @Critternation3000 Tell that to the Elcor!
[03/15/18, 12:33:43 PM] <JeffM0307> Rule judge?

[03/15/18, 12:33:56 PM] <Andyinsomnia> !mercer Becca jcvimKappa
[03/15/18, 12:33:56 PM] <Nightbot> Words from our DM to the Critters: "Part of playing the game is messing up. Forgetting rules, misinterpreting elements, etc. We're far from paragon players. It's all just part of the fun!" - Matt Mercer
[03/15/18, 12:33:56 PM] <feathersflight> I'm with you Becca!
[03/15/18, 12:33:57 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Beccu Scott Is a Halfling Rouge Angel.

[03/15/18, 12:34:35 PM] <Critternation3000> "cool i dont understand" definitely whitney
[03/15/18, 12:34:39 PM] <VermillionCrimson> Judge just makes me think of Final Fantasy Tactics.
[03/15/18, 12:35:15 PM] <VermillionCrimson> South Africa? Is this Neill Blomkamp land?
[03/15/18, 12:35:37 PM] <Critternation3000> r6rekt r6rekt r6rekt r6rekt r6rekt roving band
[03/15/18, 12:35:52 PM] <stargazer1977> Thinking of Final Fantasy Tactics is never a bad thing. But for FFT I'm way more into the first one of the series (the PS1 game). So when I think of Judge, I think of Final Fantasy XII.
[03/15/18, 12:36:20 PM] <feathersflight> I really want to get Weave, but I don't know that I'd ever actually get to play with anyone
[03/15/18, 12:36:26 PM] <RealMicah> Poor stinky Amy.

[03/15/18, 12:37:00 PM] <Tommydee92> Hey now, Caleb is just awesome and the stench is just character building for others!!
[03/15/18, 12:37:09 PM] <stargazer1977> Yes, each arc is 2 episodes.
[03/15/18, 12:37:17 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> ADVENTURE TIME!
[03/15/18, 12:37:22 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Greep!
[03/15/18, 12:37:44 PM] <Zismarith> *Leg.* Back of your leg.
[03/15/18, 12:37:49 PM] <Andyinsomnia> G&S now require at least 1 stinky character in all RPGs. Tune in to Dick and Johnson and Shield of Tomorrow to find out who hasn't been showering in those shows
[03/15/18, 12:37:52 PM] <nonegoodleft> This is my first time being able to catch this.
[03/15/18, 12:37:57 PM] <postdataest> You can find more information at: https://weave.game/

[03/15/18, 12:38:06 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> speaking of Final Fantasy Tactics, I still have to laugh when I remember "Mimic Donovan" can put enemies to sleep~who hasn't had a teacher with...soporiffic qualities?
[03/15/18, 12:38:08 PM] <Caviar_Liberta> and some of those connections might be high Kappa

[03/15/18, 12:39:50 PM] <Dampsad> The rails existed very early on in the conceptualizing stage but were the very first thing cut for the sake of the budget
