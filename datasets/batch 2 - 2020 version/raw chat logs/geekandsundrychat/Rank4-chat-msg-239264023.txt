[03/16/18, 7:07:33 AM] <GreenishPtero> QUESTION What features, no matter how ridiculous or over the top, would you like to see in a Jaeger
[03/16/18, 7:07:39 AM] <seannock> live?
[03/16/18, 7:07:41 AM] <AlphaSnowolf78> Question: have they named the other dimension

[03/16/18, 7:09:06 AM] <Ossborn> Category 1 ... annd during the movie, they had tzheir first Category 5
[03/16/18, 7:09:06 AM] <MonochromaticWeiss> Thank goodness you‚Äôre streaming, I need something to distract me, I saw someone get hit by a car while I was leaving high school....(Don‚Äôt know what condition they are in but they didn‚Äôt look too beaten up)
[03/16/18, 7:09:18 AM] <Highfarm73> Only Kaiju I liked was when Kaiju Big Battel entered Chikara :D
[03/16/18, 7:09:32 AM] <EricaTheStrange> the golden gate bridge is always getting trashed
[03/16/18, 7:09:34 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Question: Why are their two pilot Jaeger?
[03/16/18, 7:10:08 AM] <Nosracrolyat27> @alexanderhero83 so that the rift didn‚Äôt kill them
[03/16/18, 7:10:19 AM] <EricaTheStrange> because one person can't handle the mental load of piloting a jeager @Alexanderhero83
[03/16/18, 7:10:23 AM] <Lostie_815> When you say Kaiju I think of my friends cat...
[03/16/18, 7:10:24 AM] <Alucidshadow> @Alexanderhero83 The mental toil of connecting to a jaeger would kill a single person
[03/16/18, 7:10:33 AM] <fluffyfrills> @Alexanderhero83 I can answer that. It's cause one pilot actually will experience overload from the mechanisms that make piloting a jaeger possible.
[03/16/18, 7:10:41 AM] <hvhypervelocity> Kaiju should always be allowed to destroy anything and everything
[03/16/18, 7:10:56 AM] <Lostie_815> CHARLIE!
[03/16/18, 7:11:27 AM] <EricaTheStrange> they do @hvhypervelocity
[03/16/18, 7:11:31 AM] <Saraphys> OOooohh... thats why we're talking Pacific Rim... its made by Legendary. Gotta appease those corporate overlords...
[03/16/18, 7:11:56 AM] <ladysinglehanded> why does those scenes remind me of an anime I'v seen?
[03/16/18, 7:11:57 AM] <EricaTheStrange> it's more about it being a great film @seannock
[03/16/18, 7:12:08 AM] <EricaTheStrange> @Saraphys
[03/16/18, 7:12:21 AM] <digitalmaan> Its a new movie ... that's why they're talking about ti
[03/16/18, 7:12:27 AM] <Highfarm73> I wouldn't call it a great film though
[03/16/18, 7:12:41 AM] <fluffyfrills> Pacific Rim was the best film
[03/16/18, 7:12:52 AM] <fluffyfrills> It was just so interesting!
