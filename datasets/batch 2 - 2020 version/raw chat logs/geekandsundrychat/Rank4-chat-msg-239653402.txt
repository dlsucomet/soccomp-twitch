[03/17/18, 6:06:47 AM] <arctic_plays_> Question: Why is Fortnite so popular?
[03/17/18, 6:06:48 AM] <Ossborn> Question: Is Vision worthy, or can he lift Mjollnir because he is not an human being?
[03/17/18, 6:06:55 AM] <Danoba> @opivy0214 I got it but thanks for using the format.
[03/17/18, 6:07:06 AM] <Nightbot> Download the new Critical Role theme song for Campaign Two! http://itunes.apple.com/album/id1331550250?ls=1&app=itunes Sales of the song support the musician, Jason Charles Miller.
[03/17/18, 6:07:24 AM] <Ethix215> @opivy0214 yeah but it takes a lot of energy to move a 100 ton mech, so it would move very slow and be super vulnerable...
[03/17/18, 6:07:29 AM] <BanthaFodder> Just watched Thor 1, trucks couldn't pull it, off the pillar of dirt that seemed to be immune to being moved as well.
[03/17/18, 6:07:33 AM] <rurutu> Fortnite is popular cause its fun and people follow trends
[03/17/18, 6:07:40 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Question: What happened if you hit water at terminal velocity?

[03/17/18, 6:08:21 AM] <DoctorJohnGeorgeFauste> Kyle your teleportation from your pacific rim episode might work using manipulations of Gravitons Kyle. Neutron stars and Black holes emit so much gravitational force that they literally bend space-time.
[03/17/18, 6:08:28 AM] <Phoenixking6> he's got the power stone in there too for gods sake

[03/17/18, 6:20:25 AM] <evender_> QUESTION: How can we restart the core of mars to keep a hydrogen atmosphere?
[03/17/18, 6:20:28 AM] <rurutu> no shockwave in space either
[03/17/18, 6:20:32 AM] <Wintergate0> you would heard the gases strike your ship though
[03/17/18, 6:20:39 AM] <Ethix215> @evender_ you need to re-introduce water, its not in the core
[03/17/18, 6:20:44 AM] <StageEastEastport> no air but there is hydrogen and the atoms of the ship to transmit the waves
[03/17/18, 6:20:57 AM] <duskiedude> But spaceship has a lot of air in them though.
[03/17/18, 6:21:07 AM] <Shadakh> @rurutu no air-based shockwave. but if the explosion sends out matter that hits you
[03/17/18, 6:21:24 AM] <Ethix215> @duskiedude yeah, less than in SPACE
[03/17/18, 6:21:37 AM] <megaguitar01> You need a lot more energy to actually get waves in space
[03/17/18, 6:21:42 AM] <Shadakh> @rurutu but i guess that's shrapnel not a shockwave so ya, my terminology was wrong
