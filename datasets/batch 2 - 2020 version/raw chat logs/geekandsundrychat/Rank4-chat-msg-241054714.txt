[03/21/18, 9:47:30 AM] <silverw0lf212> Why is there a pillow of Matt in the room?
[03/21/18, 9:47:30 AM] <kieku666> that pillow
[03/21/18, 9:47:40 AM] <hauwkmartin> been looking for a cheep alternative to spotify for my games
[03/21/18, 9:47:42 AM] <JollyGreen1881> @silverw0lf212 why not?
[03/21/18, 9:47:43 AM] <Stressed_DM> Best pillow
[03/21/18, 9:47:45 AM] <EmilytheBard> i sincerely hope that the matt pillow becomes a permanent thing
[03/21/18, 9:47:45 AM] <rorymgal> I’m so glad they’re using this music.
[03/21/18, 9:47:45 AM] <Kitzara> Does Matt know about that pillow? :P
[03/21/18, 9:47:50 AM] <hieronymous__flex> what up my dudes
[03/21/18, 9:47:50 AM] <MiHonoKo> @silverw0lf212 to snuggle
[03/21/18, 9:47:51 AM] <CassieBanks> I do too, but I think I'd rather have one of those lifesize cardboard cutouts of Matt so I could put it by my front door to guard my apartment.
[03/21/18, 9:47:52 AM] <shrubw8> Awesome music!
[03/21/18, 9:47:52 AM] <Danoba> @silverw0lf212 I think the better question is why hasn't been always in the room.
[03/21/18, 9:47:54 AM] <maddnerd> the real question is why ISNT there pillows of everyone else?
[03/21/18, 9:48:01 AM] <Miraellyn> Because we need Matt there even when he's not.

[03/21/18, 9:48:08 AM] <Vellectrum> Sam needs to have a pillow that has a picture of that pillow with a picture of that pillow on it.
[03/21/18, 9:48:10 AM] <ShurikenSean> anyone know the epic song ?
[03/21/18, 9:48:12 AM] <Loyalbluefox28> I think it would be great with Matt on the show AND the pillow haha...might get a little awkward haha

[03/21/18, 9:48:33 AM] <ouyangwulong> Guard matt would be hillarious. Burglar breaks in, rounds corner in dark, meets with the cold gaze of Matt in leathers, leaning against the wall...

[03/21/18, 9:48:38 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm not sure how much Matt wants a body pillow of him to be sold on the store.
