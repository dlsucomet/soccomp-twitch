[03/21/18, 7:06:13 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> microtransactions might be viewed differently if the devs paid gamers for doing stuff

[03/21/18, 7:06:56 AM] <SvenEightyFive> THAT'S why you blow those cartridges?!
[03/21/18, 7:07:05 AM] <Andyinsomnia> bring a whole new meaning to blow on the cartridge
[03/21/18, 7:07:06 AM] <feathersflight> You broke Erika, omg
[03/21/18, 7:07:13 AM] <Dryst83> :D

[03/21/18, 7:07:17 AM] <ghosthack159> Luigi has a package
[03/21/18, 7:07:19 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Wait, drug smuggling in game cartridges? That's unexpected.
[03/21/18, 7:07:24 AM] <Compel_Bast> *405* people currently looking at Erika
[03/21/18, 7:07:24 AM] <kolbedanielson> I know this one, its fucked up

[03/21/18, 7:07:28 AM] <Ossborn> They shouldnt have blown ithe cartridge connections that much... that was what made them look suspicious :-D
[03/21/18, 7:07:36 AM] <Marb_04> its a tennis ball
[03/21/18, 7:07:37 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> O.O

[03/21/18, 7:07:55 AM] <Zismarith> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Trish!
[03/21/18, 7:08:00 AM] <mercury083> Maybe someone took blowing into a cartridge a little too literally?
[03/21/18, 7:08:05 AM] <CabeBedlam> Solid use of google alerts.
[03/21/18, 7:08:09 AM] <varg76> luigi been laying that pipe
[03/21/18, 7:08:09 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> hard hitting news
[03/21/18, 7:08:12 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> it is just a tennis ball for when one of the players foul the active ball out of the court
[03/21/18, 7:08:32 AM] <kolbedanielson> Oh shit
[03/21/18, 7:08:33 AM] <JC_Wijma> Luigi has a work-pipe... what a surprise....
[03/21/18, 7:08:41 AM] <Andyinsomnia> I love how many IP crossovers we are getting recently
[03/21/18, 7:08:49 AM] <FuffyButt> Did Erika have sugar today?

[03/21/18, 7:09:26 AM] <JC_Wijma> @FuffyButt Doesn't she always have her sugar?
[03/21/18, 7:09:28 AM] <PSWii2008> :(
[03/21/18, 7:09:30 AM] <feathersflight> I would watch that twitch stream, definitely
[03/21/18, 7:09:32 AM] <electro30006> Would be cool if Olivia Munn did a Twitch stream someday...
[03/21/18, 7:09:40 AM] <The_TBoyce> OMG, now I really want Obama to play video games on a Twitch channel! <3
[03/21/18, 7:09:43 AM] <varg76> welcome the rise of KB toys
[03/21/18, 7:09:49 AM] <stargazer1977> I've only ever shopped in a Toys R Us once in my life. Just never grew up with them.
[03/21/18, 7:09:54 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I don't think I've been inside a Toys store for almost a decade.
[03/21/18, 7:09:57 AM] <thotheads1981> @vexelghost the already made that
[03/21/18, 7:10:02 AM] <ghosthack159> Erika = ACTING!!!
[03/21/18, 7:10:16 AM] <The_TBoyce> With actual Nerf guns too. Impressive!
[03/21/18, 7:10:20 AM] <CabeBedlam> Erika is a nerf veteran.
[03/21/18, 7:10:22 AM] <DrakeFS> it was more about the fact that Toys'R'Us had over 5 billion dollars in depbt it could not pay down over 20+ years
[03/21/18, 7:10:31 AM] <ChileBean15> Hahaha, wow. That was awesome!
[03/21/18, 7:10:37 AM] <Andyinsomnia> I really enjoyed the new tomb raider film
[03/21/18, 7:10:38 AM] <The_TBoyce> Tomb Raider HYPE!!! I can't wait to see Alicia Vikander in action!
[03/21/18, 7:10:38 AM] <stargazer1977> Erika has Nerf wars in her house, like all the time.
[03/21/18, 7:10:42 AM] <varg76> faster prompter
[03/21/18, 7:10:44 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Erika holds an annual nerf war at her place... she's seen it all
[03/21/18, 7:10:46 AM] <SvenEightyFive> Jeeesus, Erika. Breathe!

[03/21/18, 7:11:16 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Kate makes a perfect Lara.

[03/21/18, 7:11:53 AM] <Emcee11> We need Lara Croft in Smash Brothers.
[03/21/18, 7:11:57 AM] <itcouldnotpossiblymatter> I was referencing old school laura croft games, sorry
[03/21/18, 7:11:59 AM] <The_TBoyce> Nice try, Kate. You can't ruin Indiana Jones or Lara Croft for me.

[03/21/18, 7:12:48 AM] <stargazer1977> Tomb Raider is okay, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first 3 Indiana Jones movies, sorry.
[03/21/18, 7:12:48 AM] <CabeBedlam> BOLD CLAIM!
[03/21/18, 7:12:50 AM] <The_TBoyce> LOL, nice burn! :D
[03/21/18, 7:12:51 AM] <JeffM0307> Thanks, Kate
[03/21/18, 7:12:51 AM] <stargazer1977> It's not even close.
[03/21/18, 7:12:52 AM] <73jt> Thanks Kate!

[03/21/18, 7:12:52 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Let's try something new! What do you guys think of the new style "God of War" is taking with it's narrative?
[03/21/18, 7:12:56 AM] <Fu4ow> Vikander is also more fit than Harrison was

[03/21/18, 7:13:08 AM] <ChileBean15> I'm not even remotely sure what just happened.
[03/21/18, 7:13:10 AM] <TalosUlfberht> is it thursday yet?
[03/21/18, 7:13:16 AM] <Compel_Bast> Funnily enough, my main touchstone comparisons for the film was more James Bond than Ind
[03/21/18, 7:13:17 AM] <ghosthack159> The new Tomb Raider was like a solid 85%
[03/21/18, 7:13:17 AM] <Compel_Bast> y
[03/21/18, 7:13:26 AM] <spUwUtnik> lol
[03/21/18, 7:13:30 AM] <JC_Wijma> @TalosUlfberht Not yet
[03/21/18, 7:13:32 AM] <shidareAKI> Ooo Ryan posing questions to chat. Nice.
[03/21/18, 7:13:37 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Oh hai!
[03/21/18, 7:13:44 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> =P
[03/21/18, 7:13:45 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Now I wanna see Chief in a fez, for some reason
[03/21/18, 7:13:48 AM] <afirmativeten4> Good job, Kate!
[03/21/18, 7:13:49 AM] <TalosUlfberht> :(
[03/21/18, 7:13:56 AM] <shidareAKI> Hi @hydrosnail_ryangreen how are you?
[03/21/18, 7:13:59 AM] <JeffM0307> @HydroSnail_RyanGreen Hello, Ryan
[03/21/18, 7:14:00 AM] <stargazer1977> @HydroSnail_RyanGreen while I really like the gameplay of the 6 God of War games before, it had really reached it's end. I like the change in gameplay just for being different, and I really like the change in mythology factoring into the gameplay.
[03/21/18, 7:14:18 AM] <The_TBoyce> If "The Last Of Us" has taught me anything, is that a parent/child dynamic leads an illuminating and profitable story.
[03/21/18, 7:14:52 AM] <ghosthack159> I'm totally fine with games taking a new narrative direction AS LONG AS they maintain/hold true to the underlying elements that made the original endearing
[03/21/18, 7:14:54 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Hey all! Doing well today, thank you =D
[03/21/18, 7:15:01 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Who would win in a fight, Aloy and her machines or Kratos?

[03/21/18, 7:15:24 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Oh! Good question @PipersTwin
[03/21/18, 7:15:26 AM] <Zismarith> Dream Daddy DLC: The Throne of Olympus.
[03/21/18, 7:15:27 AM] <vexelghost> Don't call Kratos a deadbeat dad though as he'll beat you dead.
[03/21/18, 7:15:36 AM] <stargazer1977> Kratos is still a God, I like Aloy more, but he has magical abilities so it's not really a fight.
[03/21/18, 7:15:57 AM] <JC_Wijma> @PipersTwin As much as I love Aloy, I would have to go with the godslayer.

[03/21/18, 7:16:27 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Also, God of War really isn't for kids.
[03/21/18, 7:16:54 AM] <shidareAKI> Well then
[03/21/18, 7:16:59 AM] <ghosthack159> Who would think she didn't look tough enough?! Crazyness!
[03/21/18, 7:17:02 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Kratos has never faced a machine army though @JC_Wijma
[03/21/18, 7:17:05 AM] <EmxLBJ> Love this show ....but how did Mothership get canceled over this? Sounds harsh but as a fan i'm really curious.
[03/21/18, 7:17:15 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> What would Mr. Rogers do?

[03/21/18, 7:17:43 AM] <stargazer1977> Bayonetta is great just like it is. She totally owns her sexuality and the combat has improved with each of the first two games. The third one is still coming and we will see if Platinum improves it still further.
[03/21/18, 7:17:48 AM] <vexelghost> These game trends aren't mature, they just changed them for aging gamers.
[03/21/18, 7:17:51 AM] <FuffyButt> Geralt doesn't like it when you call sex games "mini" it is a ego thing
[03/21/18, 7:18:43 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Possible answer: join the Gaming Industry and show everyone there are other ways to create media
[03/21/18, 7:18:55 AM] <Zismarith> I started gaming by bouncing on turtle's heads and trying and failing to dig E.T. out of a pit. Now I game by raising blueberries in Stardew. It's changed.
[03/21/18, 7:18:57 AM] <Acework> so when is talks machina?
[03/21/18, 7:19:11 AM] <ghosthack159> Well, think about Dynasty Warriors....
[03/21/18, 7:19:12 AM] <shidareAKI> !whenistm
[03/21/18, 7:19:13 AM] <Nightbot> Talks Machina is on at 7 PM PDT, it is currently 4:19 PM PDT. There is 2 Hours, 40 Minutes, 47 Seconds until the next episode of Talks Machina. This has command has been run 175 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[03/21/18, 7:19:14 AM] <The_TBoyce> You know who I would love to see play an older female video game protagonist? Shohreh Aghdashloo. She is a phenomenal actress.
[03/21/18, 7:19:14 AM] <ghosthack159> :P
[03/21/18, 7:19:29 AM] <stargazer1977> Bad example, I love the Zelda series but totally hate Breath of the Wild, because they removed what I loved about the series.
[03/21/18, 7:19:35 AM] <g4u55c4t> Gears of War did the Dad /Son thing.
