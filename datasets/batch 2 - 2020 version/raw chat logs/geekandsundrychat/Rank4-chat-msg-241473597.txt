[03/22/18, 8:10:59 AM] <legollamas> so how long until the toaster becomes a monster?
[03/22/18, 8:11:05 AM] <bigxviili> this is hilarious
[03/22/18, 8:11:10 AM] <super390> CYLON!
[03/22/18, 8:11:29 AM] <harberst> Okay, they've got the talking toaster. Now where's the blanket and the vacuum?
[03/22/18, 8:11:37 AM] <Chovexani> XD Toaster said yall are -stank-
[03/22/18, 8:11:39 AM] <ArisBranwin> I’m waiting for the toaster to be a ninja
[03/22/18, 8:11:40 AM] <vexelghost> I hope Powdered Toast Man doesn't steal Toasty.
[03/22/18, 8:11:42 AM] <minimarker> Of course Toastie has a nose!
[03/22/18, 8:11:49 AM] <bigxviili> @harberst yes lol
[03/22/18, 8:11:49 AM] <Chovexani> yesh @harberst
[03/22/18, 8:11:58 AM] <cinphoria> this is the best toast voice <3
[03/22/18, 8:12:08 AM] <minimarker> Johnson was the child!
[03/22/18, 8:12:08 AM] <bastienfils> How does a sentient toaster with a working nose know if it's having a stroke or not?
[03/22/18, 8:12:15 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Toaster got some nice gams... just sayin'
[03/22/18, 8:12:15 AM] <Chovexani> XD streeeeeeetch
[03/22/18, 8:12:20 AM] <chaoticloony> Toastie needs to visit the Toaster Ghost YouTube channel

[03/22/18, 8:12:52 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehheheh, this makes me so happy!
[03/22/18, 8:13:07 AM] <super390> It would be really sad if Toasty now has a functioning nervous system and thus can't toast bread without extreme pain.
[03/22/18, 8:13:14 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I'm dying laughing.
[03/22/18, 8:13:25 AM] <Grading> The background laughter gets me every time :D
[03/22/18, 8:13:25 AM] <AstralUnicorn> @super390 :(
[03/22/18, 8:13:40 AM] <minimarker> We saw Toastie toast already, @super390, we know it didn't hurt them
[03/22/18, 8:14:00 AM] <ArisBranwin> At least the beer isn’t alive
[03/22/18, 8:14:05 AM] <vexelghost> He's speaking in tongues. Call Constantine!
[03/22/18, 8:14:07 AM] <ArisBranwin> Then they’d run screaming
[03/22/18, 8:14:17 AM] <Chovexani> The Vacuum was grumpy af

[03/22/18, 8:17:44 AM] <Grading> I wonder what Chief's sleeping cap looks like

[03/22/18, 8:19:16 AM] <ExplicitSoupcan> I'll bet the chief's vacuum and electric toothbrush have some dirty confessions to make.
[03/22/18, 8:19:34 AM] <rfors96369> Makes perfect sense.
[03/22/18, 8:19:41 AM] <bastienfils> Am I the only one who thinks it's kind of weird and immersion breaking that they just put the real live action Erika into this animated episode?
[03/22/18, 8:19:51 AM] <cinphoria> xD
[03/22/18, 8:20:31 AM] <minimarker> :(
[03/22/18, 8:20:36 AM] <minimarker> this is so sad
[03/22/18, 8:21:00 AM] <CaptianTrips88> Johnson's supernatural neck
[03/22/18, 8:21:04 AM] <bastienfils> "Does luggage count as an appliance? Did they walk away, too?"
[03/22/18, 8:21:09 AM] <chaoticloony> Kids are just weird!
[03/22/18, 8:21:26 AM] <rfors96369> So sad that it's not sad. It's KICK ASS!

[03/22/18, 8:23:07 AM] <vexelghost> Is the whole episode animated? This is impressive if it's all improved.
