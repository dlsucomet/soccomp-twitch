[03/22/18, 12:35:27 PM] <vexelghost> It beats scissors. :p
[03/22/18, 12:35:28 PM] <KBTibbs> This show is not off the rails. Weeks ago, the rails were removed and recycled into lawn art.

[03/22/18, 12:37:05 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> I guess we will be standing out of the school parties awkwardly because we are not sure we can go in. LOL
[03/22/18, 12:37:20 PM] <vexelghost> I have the maturity of a high school student. Close enough.
[03/22/18, 12:37:21 PM] <meadow_creek> was in high school 3 years ago
[03/22/18, 12:37:38 PM] <cinphoria> highschool was over a decade ago for me :P

[03/22/18, 12:38:22 PM] <JabberLockey> High school is a hell of a lot harder when you've got the highest GPA. You don't fit in anywhere. That's what they tell me.
[03/22/18, 12:38:25 PM] <stitchybabie22> I. am. So. PUMPED.

[03/22/18, 12:38:49 PM] <harberst> What we're learning is that there's a fairly decent age range in chat.
[03/22/18, 12:38:49 PM] <stargazer1977> Most of the people I was at all acquainted with in HS are now grandparents.
[03/22/18, 12:38:51 PM] <whippetpuli> 15 years behind me!
[03/22/18, 12:38:57 PM] <strous1> Longer then I want to say here.
[03/22/18, 12:38:57 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> People born the year I graduated can just barely drink legally.
