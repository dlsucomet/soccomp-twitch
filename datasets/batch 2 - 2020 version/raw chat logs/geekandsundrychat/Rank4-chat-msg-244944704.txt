[03/31/18, 12:06:45 PM] <canaahawke> I feel like Taliesin had better avoid talking about Midsummer Night's Dream or he might accidentally expose himself as the fey spirit he is
[03/31/18, 12:06:50 PM] <girlybits> I'M RIGHT HERE, STOP ASKING WHERE I AM.
[03/31/18, 12:06:52 PM] <chaoticloony> LOL

[03/31/18, 12:08:59 PM] <fabledfirbolg> idk whose outfit I like more Taliesin's or Marisha's
[03/31/18, 12:09:02 PM] <stargazer1977> To be fair, I have used both Calculus and Shakespeare in my life a lot.
[03/31/18, 12:09:07 PM] <darkhalfelf284> Othello!

[03/31/18, 12:10:30 PM] <emmaleficent> I don't understand why teachers make you read Shakespeare. It's supposed to be watched (and it's amazing when you watch it!)
[03/31/18, 12:10:30 PM] <phoenixgoth> @misssunflower94 Maybe he's late?
[03/31/18, 12:10:36 PM] <misssunflower94> oh no theater ppl ok
