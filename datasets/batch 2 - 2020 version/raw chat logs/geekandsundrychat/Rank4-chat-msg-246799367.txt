[04/5/18, 8:12:17 AM] <atren1> Their names should be Peter Puffer and Willy Wrangler

[04/5/18, 8:15:00 AM] <CaptianTrips88> Gary Buesey is probably still there
[04/5/18, 8:15:20 AM] <Danoba> @Smarcey It started as an RPG and evolved into an animated RPG.
[04/5/18, 8:15:26 AM] <minimarker> @Greenlyon I considered that answer but decided against it for some reason. Sorry I have failed you

[04/5/18, 8:19:17 AM] <super390> One of my favorite lies from John Hodgman's books is the claim that Battlestar Galatica, the 1979 TV show, was itself a reboot of a 1938 radio show.

[04/5/18, 8:22:33 AM] <super390> As we all know from Star Trek III The Search for Spock, it's easy to arrest rapid aging at exactly the right point to continue to keep using the same actor as before.
