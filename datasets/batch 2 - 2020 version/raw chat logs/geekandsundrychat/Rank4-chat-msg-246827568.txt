[04/5/18, 12:33:27 PM] <TheCanadianBrownie> I believe weave is a hair style
[04/5/18, 12:33:29 PM] <chaoticloony> @MrBigBentz It is a RPG system that uses dice, cards and an app
[04/5/18, 12:33:30 PM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> @misssunflower94 stay strong tangy!!!

[04/5/18, 12:33:48 PM] <TheTriscuit> @MrBigBentz A very new RPG system that uses a tarot deck combined with an app to build dynamic stories
[04/5/18, 12:33:49 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Ripartist
[04/5/18, 12:33:49 PM] <misssunflower94> @hundredsofsmallbirds the magic that keeps me animated only lasts so long!
[04/5/18, 12:33:53 PM] <Mainnalle> hi guys! @MrBigBentz Weave is a rpg game based on tarot cards, dice and an app. it is fast, and easy and rules lite.
[04/5/18, 12:33:53 PM] <VoxFan1966> so, are they going to be playing D&D?
[04/5/18, 12:33:54 PM] <Quaraxkad1> GeekandSundry / Danoba... i have noticed the pre-show title cards have been extremely short lately... is that intentional? i liked when they stayed up for a while before the show starts to give me time to tune on time
[04/5/18, 12:33:55 PM] <phoenixgoth> @misssunflower94 i think I'm turning into a sleepy rainbow birb atm so we can be bird and gourd together
[04/5/18, 12:34:03 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Mainnalle
[04/5/18, 12:34:06 PM] <glassghosty> They should try to get Laura Bailey as the next guest!!
[04/5/18, 12:34:07 PM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Could use a volume boost
[04/5/18, 12:34:08 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I want Marisha Ray on Shield of Tomorrow.
[04/5/18, 12:34:09 PM] <Sirenhunter5> Yay! Whiteny's back!
[04/5/18, 12:34:15 PM] <misssunflower94> I do need to look into what my city's 826 is - I know we have one
[04/5/18, 12:34:18 PM] <MrBigBentz> So like D&D but different?
[04/5/18, 12:34:19 PM] <TheTriscuit> @VoxFan1966 Twitch doesn't have a generic RPG tag
[04/5/18, 12:34:23 PM] <Rachel_Iriswings> hello everyone!
[04/5/18, 12:34:27 PM] <phoenixgoth> @belleuchtung Might be a bit difficult given she's pregnant.
[04/5/18, 12:34:28 PM] <chaoticloony> @VoxFan1966 It is a RPG, but a different system
[04/5/18, 12:34:32 PM] <CharacterStigma> PogChamp I wish I had that at my School as a kid
[04/5/18, 12:34:35 PM] <chuckswain> @MrBigBentz close enough

[04/5/18, 12:36:06 PM] <lacedaisies> has the show been on long? missed the start
[04/5/18, 12:36:08 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Video games? What a trend. Kappa
[04/5/18, 12:36:15 PM] <phoenixgoth> @misssunflower94 you joke, but there is actually a species called catbird.
[04/5/18, 12:36:15 PM] <VermillionCrimson> @lacedaisies Nope

[04/5/18, 12:36:45 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Favorite card drawn so far?
[04/5/18, 12:36:46 PM] <smutwithplot> THANK GOODNESS FOR TWITTER PUSHES. I almost missed this
[04/5/18, 12:36:49 PM] <VermillionCrimson> Also on a completely unrelated note: lol I'm so done trying to get Alpha to stream live at a decent quality. No issues on Twitch of course.
[04/5/18, 12:36:54 PM] <Aisle5> Becca smash
[04/5/18, 12:36:54 PM] <harberst> @aleph_sharp On the one hand I'd love to see that on the other, given how toxic parts of the fandom are towards people (especially -it seems- women) who don't play exactly how they want... I don't wish that on her at all.

[04/5/18, 12:37:53 PM] <smutwithplot> I like Amy's mug!
[04/5/18, 12:37:58 PM] <stargazer1977> @hundredsofsmallbirds sitting back and letting the story wash over you is also a valid choice. :)
[04/5/18, 12:37:59 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> ooo the mask plus sneaky!

[04/5/18, 12:41:30 PM] <stargazer1977> Nukes Bazooks sounds like the sequel to Missile Command. A game I played way too much in my youth.
[04/5/18, 12:41:39 PM] <jameskarle> Hi how r u
[04/5/18, 12:41:39 PM] <Weirwood> Sounds like a crazy version of Snakes and Laddes
[04/5/18, 12:41:40 PM] <Zismarith> Does Game Genie have any codes for Nukes Bazooks?
[04/5/18, 12:41:41 PM] <koollivi> sounds like an awesome drink!
[04/5/18, 12:41:42 PM] <misssunflower94> no you don't amy
[04/5/18, 12:41:43 PM] <Weirwood> *Ladders
[04/5/18, 12:41:45 PM] <Geekstronaut> I vote for Becca! thats not rigged, right?
[04/5/18, 12:41:47 PM] <silverstardruid> @TheTriscuit thank you
[04/5/18, 12:42:03 PM] <Robjamesmorgan> @thetriscuit what is the screen made of

[04/5/18, 12:42:10 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> It is never rigged @Geekstronaut
[04/5/18, 12:42:12 PM] <Sirenhunter5> @stargazer1977 isnt Missile Command the one where you use missiles from other missiles from destroying your buildings?
[04/5/18, 12:42:20 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Mmm Tortoise, sounds fun
[04/5/18, 12:42:22 PM] <TiamatZX> Speaking of monks, I have a tabaxi kensei monk lined up. Pretty good with a longsword, not very charismatic
[04/5/18, 12:42:27 PM] <glassghosty> I like how this already sounds like a more subdued Gloomy story... of course, it's kind of impossible not to be more subdued than Amy's buckwild story
[04/5/18, 12:42:28 PM] <stargazer1977> @Sirenhunter5 yup, that's the one.
[04/5/18, 12:42:30 PM] <TurtlesAndTentacles> the hell is this?
[04/5/18, 12:42:40 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> this is amazing
[04/5/18, 12:42:42 PM] <phoenixgoth> Gloom Bay, the place where all the kids are underage drivers
[04/5/18, 12:42:45 PM] <CharacterStigma> LUL
[04/5/18, 12:42:48 PM] <JoeSondow> Let's hope Amy's 5-year-old ends up driving.
[04/5/18, 12:42:48 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> !wtfisthis @TurtlesAndTentacles
[04/5/18, 12:42:49 PM] <Nightbot> Weave Society is the RPG tale for the digital age. Storytellers Amy Dallen, Whitney Moore, Becca Scott, Stef Woodburn, and Gina DeVivo come together to jump into one of the many fantastical worlds of Weave. Where will they end up next?
[04/5/18, 12:42:50 PM] <phoenixgoth> Marisha's face XD
[04/5/18, 12:42:51 PM] <TheTriscuit> @Robjamesmorgan Walnut, Zebrawood, and curly maple
[04/5/18, 12:43:00 PM] <Sirenhunter5> @stargazer1977 I grew up with Playstation but Missile Command was far more entertaining to me lol
[04/5/18, 12:43:00 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> "trouble" maker
[04/5/18, 12:43:04 PM] <Paladin356> didn't Aladdin say that exact same thing before he got caught?
