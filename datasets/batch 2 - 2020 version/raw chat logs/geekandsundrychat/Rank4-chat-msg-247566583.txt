[04/7/18, 7:09:19 AM] <Ossborn> Junil Rue and Borg... they have a pencil breaking history
[04/7/18, 7:09:19 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> Brog
[04/7/18, 7:09:23 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> Borg*
[04/7/18, 7:09:24 AM] <okayestrob> okay do they have a receding hairline or is that the lighting?

[04/7/18, 7:09:41 AM] <Fractal_Paladin> howdy
[04/7/18, 7:09:45 AM] <starpilotsix> Canada? We're normally more polite than that? Sending Borg to Sam, for shame!
[04/7/18, 7:09:46 AM] <DeceptiKHAANNN> @IslandRzrbk THey did last episode? I didn't see anything about this one.
[04/7/18, 7:09:47 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> at least Hector can touch that Borg Figurine because reasons
[04/7/18, 7:09:50 AM] <shidareAKI> @libwritberry not always!
[04/7/18, 7:09:56 AM] <Zismarith> The itsy-bitsy borg drone went up the water spout. Down came the rain which it promptly assimilated.
[04/7/18, 7:10:02 AM] <The_TBoyce> So now both Hector and Eric can wear one. :)
[04/7/18, 7:10:11 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> hologram expert. that could definitely come in handy

[04/7/18, 7:12:20 AM] <dacheese01> lol bad dice become borg dice
[04/7/18, 7:12:23 AM] <ArisBranwin> But wouldnâ€™t the borg assimilate the jail?
[04/7/18, 7:12:34 AM] <FrankieDooSpace> "Get in there, Borg! Stay there!" :P
[04/7/18, 7:12:35 AM] <ArisBranwin> And the dice turn into borg?
[04/7/18, 7:12:36 AM] <mamalta> yay Borg Jail =D
[04/7/18, 7:12:39 AM] <shidareAKI> !frontpage
[04/7/18, 7:12:40 AM] <Nightbot> We are on the front page, which means we have an influx of new people coming in here. Some are polite, some are not. Please let the mods handle those who are not. Sit back, enjoy the show, and DON'T FEED THE TROLLS.
[04/7/18, 7:12:40 AM] <darkofnate> Wouldn't Borg dice just be a cube ship?

[04/7/18, 7:13:04 AM] <dacheese01> mini borg cube
[04/7/18, 7:13:04 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> hateful eight taught me not to trust anyone
[04/7/18, 7:13:05 AM] <Compel_Bast> the dice
[04/7/18, 7:13:09 AM] <davidflegel> Star Trek question: Does anyone know if Betazoids read emotions all the time or is that something they can turn on and off?
[04/7/18, 7:13:21 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> ah but as each die gets assimilated they all become one... which is a crit in ST:A
[04/7/18, 7:13:32 AM] <JerrodOwex> @davidflegel they can turn it off in some manner
[04/7/18, 7:13:35 AM] <darthangelus2141> @davidflegel betazoids are full telepaths deanna was half betazoid so could only read emotion
[04/7/18, 7:13:36 AM] <PhoenixBlue0> They read emotions and thoughts all the time, @davidflegel . They have to mentally shield themselves.
[04/7/18, 7:13:52 AM] <davidflegel> thanks!
[04/7/18, 7:13:55 AM] <TheUltimateTriforce> Betazoids get taught shielding, but they will always sense of the general emotions of people
[04/7/18, 7:13:56 AM] <shidareAKI> @davidflegel they start not being able to control it and are trained to control it as they get older.
[04/7/18, 7:13:58 AM] <Zismarith> @davidflegel They CAN do it all the time, but it gets a bit much, so they . . . imagine walls and doors and shields, and shut it down to a dull roar.
[04/7/18, 7:13:59 AM] <KBTibbs> @davidflegel If memory serves, it doesn't turn off, but they can try to not read it. Like not listening to a loud near-by conversation,
[04/7/18, 7:14:05 AM] <geminilightning> "Innocent criminal"
[04/7/18, 7:14:09 AM] <WelshAndyT> angelus2141 well she gave it a go lol
[04/7/18, 7:14:17 AM] <Bazag> Shout out to Valkyrie Crew
[04/7/18, 7:14:18 AM] <Riley_wolf209> laying down watching sot and eating chocolate this is going to be an exciting night
[04/7/18, 7:14:18 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I cannot wait to see Eric's True Form later today!
[04/7/18, 7:14:19 AM] <RealMicah> @davidflegel If I remember correctly, Betazoids have a perpetual low-level emotional sense that they can focus and intensify when trying to sense a particular being.
[04/7/18, 7:14:25 AM] <JerrodOwex> Thats a better way to put it @PhoenixBlue0, my brain doesnt want to work right now
[04/7/18, 7:14:30 AM] <Libwritberry> What's the current count of Sam pencil snaps?
[04/7/18, 7:14:39 AM] <Zismarith> Two.
[04/7/18, 7:14:40 AM] <ArisBranwin> Unless you were Lywaxana Troi who read everything
[04/7/18, 7:14:41 AM] <dacheese01> think 3
[04/7/18, 7:14:42 AM] <KBTibbs> All the pencils
[04/7/18, 7:14:54 AM] <ArisBranwin> And read all the allegedly dirty thoughts
[04/7/18, 7:14:56 AM] <VermillionCrimson> YES
[04/7/18, 7:15:00 AM] <dndjester> #shipofships
[04/7/18, 7:15:02 AM] <FiresOfAnarchy1> did you say love pentagon
[04/7/18, 7:15:03 AM] <Zismarith> I could've missed one.
[04/7/18, 7:15:06 AM] <strous1> Betaqzoids have to train to avoid reading and feeling emotions, or problems appear.
