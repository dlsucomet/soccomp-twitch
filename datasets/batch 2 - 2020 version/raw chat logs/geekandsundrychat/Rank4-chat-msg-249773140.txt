[04/13/18, 7:03:36 AM] <chaoticloony> I so loved Schoolhouse Rock!
[04/13/18, 7:03:37 AM] <Froggy_ass> Comics could be doing better. The industry just needs to be open to more ideas.

[04/13/18, 7:03:57 AM] <philbe63> Here's the big question: Will Taliesin be making the beard match the hair?

[04/13/18, 7:04:13 AM] <djwho> I miss Saturday morning cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:04:14 AM] <misssunflower94> The weirdness that is formative!
[04/13/18, 7:04:14 AM] <super390> Is that why when your characters get scared they rise off the ground while their legs spin in the air but don't move for a second?
[04/13/18, 7:04:21 AM] <misssunflower94> Night night @jj_dane
[04/13/18, 7:04:21 AM] <Danoba> @consuela3 He's almost there too.
[04/13/18, 7:04:23 AM] <Medinaquirin> And then there was Saturday, which began.
[04/13/18, 7:04:23 AM] <Leigh574> Nite @JJ_Dane
[04/13/18, 7:04:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Later @JJ_Dane
[04/13/18, 7:04:29 AM] <darkhalfelf284> I was a 90's kid, so I'd like to know more about 80's cartoons!
[04/13/18, 7:04:31 AM] <katkafili> night @JJ_Dane
[04/13/18, 7:04:32 AM] <Danoba> Night @JJ_Dane
[04/13/18, 7:04:37 AM] <misssunflower94> You had a strange strange childhood
[04/13/18, 7:04:40 AM] <stargazer1977> I grew up with the big 3, in fact there is still no cable where I grew up.
[04/13/18, 7:04:46 AM] <skfearlord> Happy watching (?) chat. Gonna catch some sleep and I'll be back for CR. SEE YA <3
[04/13/18, 7:04:50 AM] <MeggieMay328> I so want to make a joke about DuPoint Network but even I am too young for that one
[04/13/18, 7:04:51 AM] <Rhinorulz> I remember the days of 3, 9, 12, and then fox was 61
[04/13/18, 7:04:59 AM] <DJPheonyx> As much as Macek's metastory was very forced, Robotech was a huge reason why anime started to really take off being shown in American markets more than before
[04/13/18, 7:05:10 AM] <philbe63> 80s cartoons were during one of my attempts at marijuana...78-84...
[04/13/18, 7:05:11 AM] <super390> Saturday morning cartoons actually had a big influence on "grown-up" prime time TV, via the infamous Freddy Silverman who rose from the cartoon programming to chief of ABC and then NBC.
[04/13/18, 7:05:11 AM] <chaoticloony> I remember when we had ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS as a kid!
[04/13/18, 7:05:13 AM] <Kitzara> Fox Kids... One Saturday Morning...
[04/13/18, 7:05:22 AM] <chaoticloony> Later @skfearlord
[04/13/18, 7:05:24 AM] <stargazer1977> I loved Robotech and Starblazers.
[04/13/18, 7:05:28 AM] <katkafili> i am 90s kid and european, I know nothing about 80s morning cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:05:30 AM] <Losile> I remember a human chain to the roof adjusting the antenna so we could watch CBS
[04/13/18, 7:05:30 AM] <philbe63> Kookla Fran and Ollie!
[04/13/18, 7:05:34 AM] <Kazimov> i remember beenie and cecil
[04/13/18, 7:05:42 AM] <MeggieMay328> I'd say cartoons on Saturday were in full swing by the 1968 season but 1969 was a big year
[04/13/18, 7:05:42 AM] <ladyamphy> "for those of you who dont know cecil"
[04/13/18, 7:05:49 AM] <Sylien_> Im excited to find out how much overlab there was between american and danish kids television
[04/13/18, 7:05:59 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah I was a little young to really remember the 80's stuff, born in 1988.
[04/13/18, 7:06:01 AM] <stargazer1977> We only had PBS on very clear days, which were few and far between up in the mountains. So we only ever really had NBC, CBS, and ABC.
[04/13/18, 7:06:02 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> cocaine mostly
[04/13/18, 7:06:06 AM] <Rhinorulz> earl 90's were my bae
[04/13/18, 7:06:06 AM] <misssunflower94> I caught the tail end of Saturday cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:06:07 AM] <super390> What Silverman learned was how to apply Saturday morning cartoon strategies to dumb down network TV.
[04/13/18, 7:06:19 AM] <JordanShiveley> A big part of my childhood was Caballeros del Zodiaco, Samurai Pizza Cats etc
[04/13/18, 7:06:24 AM] <vexelghost> I caught the Force Five lineup before seeing Robotech. I guess that was my introduction to anime.
[04/13/18, 7:06:29 AM] <Sylien_> I watched Fox Kids, when it turned to Jetix, and Cartoon Network. And Then Disney Channel turned up. I prefered Jetix, it had Samurai Jack and Totally Spies
[04/13/18, 7:06:31 AM] <raphofgreengables> my god i was born in the 90s when 4kids was all the rage
[04/13/18, 7:06:32 AM] <RuzgofDI> And now you know!
[04/13/18, 7:06:35 AM] <philbe63> School House Rock is so awesome
[04/13/18, 7:06:35 AM] <taraquest> School House Rock was awesome
[04/13/18, 7:06:37 AM] <starpilotsix> Now you know! And knowing is half the battle!
[04/13/18, 7:06:40 AM] <MeggieMay328> where I lived Saturday's were moving to no cartoons by the mid 80s :(
[04/13/18, 7:06:43 AM] <Leigh574> LOVED School House Rock
[04/13/18, 7:06:46 AM] <JordanShiveley> How about all the Toth influence ion HB cartoons?!
[04/13/18, 7:06:46 AM] <stargazer1977> The Muppets and Looney Tunes were my biggest jam during that period.
[04/13/18, 7:06:50 AM] <chaoticloony> I was born in 1970, so i rember the late 70's and the 80's so well
[04/13/18, 7:06:54 AM] <artistsomeday> I cited G.I. Joe in one of my papers recently because why not
[04/13/18, 7:06:57 AM] <DJPheonyx> I *almost* invested in the pilot for a new cartoon back then, a little show about a comic book called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[04/13/18, 7:06:58 AM] <Marb_04> GI Joe always ended with some moral lesson
[04/13/18, 7:06:58 AM] <MeggieMay328> School House Rock was my childhood :D
[04/13/18, 7:07:00 AM] <misssunflower94> I had a babysitter in the 90s and we got all the morning cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:07:04 AM] <philbe63> Captain Planet?
[04/13/18, 7:07:11 AM] <super390> I saw parts of the golden age of Saturday morning cartoons in the '70s. Boy, talk about formulaic.
[04/13/18, 7:07:12 AM] <darkhalfelf284> QUESTION: What year did Bobby's World air? Cause I think it was a rerun during the 90's.
[04/13/18, 7:07:15 AM] <taraquest> 70's had good cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:07:19 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> my parents didn’t even know each other in the 70s
[04/13/18, 7:07:21 AM] <Losile> I was living through my parents' church going through Satanic Panic so THANK GODS for those educational afterwards XD
[04/13/18, 7:07:21 AM] ** MeggieMay328 sister said back in the day that she got through High School Government class using SHR
[04/13/18, 7:07:25 AM] <stargazer1977> Early 80's was a prime period for cartoons.
[04/13/18, 7:07:33 AM] <misssunflower94> Don’t do drugs stay in school
[04/13/18, 7:07:43 AM] <raphofgreengables> anyone remember when sam riegel did 90% of saturday voice acting
[04/13/18, 7:07:44 AM] <Losile> "SEE?! It's moral!"
[04/13/18, 7:07:58 AM] <DJPheonyx> SHows like G1 Transformers
[04/13/18, 7:08:01 AM] <vankeet> the toys
[04/13/18, 7:08:15 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> best cartoons were 60s (mel blanc) and 90s(rob paulson) imo
[04/13/18, 7:08:19 AM] <itskimthulhu> Can we please hit upon She-Ra? Because that was quintessential Saturday Morning Cartooning right there.
[04/13/18, 7:08:21 AM] <RuzgofDI> Heaven help your character if your cartoon became a movie. Chances are, you were going to get killed so that the toy company could introduce a new character to buy.
[04/13/18, 7:08:24 AM] <dayntee> Saw 80's cartoons and had to tune in!
[04/13/18, 7:08:30 AM] <Losile> The Carebears still got thrown out though XD Magic = Evil
[04/13/18, 7:08:38 AM] <Bihlbo> The law is there so we know what's cool and what's crappy and law-abiding
[04/13/18, 7:08:40 AM] <Marb_04> i still have Castle Greyskull
[04/13/18, 7:08:40 AM] <super390> The golden age of TV anime also happened because Japanese toymakers poured in money. The difference - they DIDN'T dictate the content of the shows. They based their toys on the shows, not the other way around.
[04/13/18, 7:08:49 AM] <Danoba> @dayntee Oh hey.
[04/13/18, 7:08:56 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> @kdkfm They're remaking that, btw.
[04/13/18, 7:08:57 AM] <misssunflower94> Ooh tell us the illegal dealings
[04/13/18, 7:08:58 AM] <dayntee> Sup @Danoba
[04/13/18, 7:08:59 AM] <vexelghost> The Toys That Made Us documentary series on Netflix goes into that.
[04/13/18, 7:09:06 AM] <djwho> I only saw some cartoons but I remember Captain Caveman, Dungeons & Dragons and I loved my Saturday mornings to just watch cartoons
[04/13/18, 7:09:12 AM] <phoenixgoth> Just popping in before I have to go to work to give all the love to Taliesin and Jody! <3
[04/13/18, 7:09:18 AM] <JeffM0307> Hello @dayntee
[04/13/18, 7:09:18 AM] <misssunflower94> @vexelghost ooooh I might look into that
[04/13/18, 7:09:19 AM] <Danoba> @dayntee Glad you could join us, I saw a bit of a preview and it's going to be very good.
[04/13/18, 7:09:21 AM] <philbe63> @vexelghost Yes! Great show! Loved it so much
[04/13/18, 7:09:25 AM] <MeggieMay328> You should bring up the Breakfast Cerial commercial issue. I didn't really know about that until way later (it predated me by a few years)
[04/13/18, 7:09:29 AM] <super390> It used to be 65 episodes - 5 days a week for 13 weeks.
[04/13/18, 7:09:30 AM] <longingfordeath_damsel> <3 <3 <3
[04/13/18, 7:09:30 AM] <Chovexani> XD Nick@Night :D
[04/13/18, 7:09:31 AM] <chaoticloony> I remember when the GI Joe comics killed off a bunch of the characters, but the cartoon didn't do that. :(
[04/13/18, 7:09:34 AM] <phoenixgoth> @Danoba give them a hug for me? :3
[04/13/18, 7:09:53 AM] <MeggieMay328> Captain Caveman was originally 1970s
[04/13/18, 7:09:59 AM] <JordanShiveley> The big Toth animation book that was part of that Toth art book trilogy is amazing
[04/13/18, 7:10:00 AM] <Sylien_> GUMMYBEARS
[04/13/18, 7:10:02 AM] <Losile> Oh Disney Afternoon <3
[04/13/18, 7:10:02 AM] <stargazer1977> Duck Tales was a weekday afternoon show, but it was simply amazing.
[04/13/18, 7:10:02 AM] <misssunflower94> I loooved nick@night
[04/13/18, 7:10:05 AM] <JeffM0307> Tale Spin, Darkwing Duck, Chip & Dale's Rescue Rangers, etc.
[04/13/18, 7:10:08 AM] <the_pale_lord> I LOVED Gargoyles!!!
[04/13/18, 7:10:10 AM] <Losile> GARGOYLES
[04/13/18, 7:10:11 AM] <philbe63> Dungeon and Dragons?
[04/13/18, 7:10:11 AM] <FenFenFam> gargoyles was dope
[04/13/18, 7:10:12 AM] <super390> It was always 4 Disney shows in a row each afternoon, I think.
[04/13/18, 7:10:14 AM] <Themonkeyprincess> Gargoyles!!! <3
