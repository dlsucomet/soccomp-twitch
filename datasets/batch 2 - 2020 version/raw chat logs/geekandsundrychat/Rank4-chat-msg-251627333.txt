[04/18/18, 7:03:34 AM] <Ossborn> Thankfully the haircuts are different, otherwise I couldnt tell them apart!
[04/18/18, 7:03:35 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Yeah, the twinning outfit is pretty cute, you both look great, Erika & Trisha!
[04/18/18, 7:03:40 AM] <Zismarith> Sorry Sparks, can't tell the difference between 720 and 1080 with my eyes on this monitor.

[04/18/18, 7:11:01 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm not offended, but I am concerned about making a caricature of someone.
[04/18/18, 7:11:37 AM] <Paladin356> oh, i get it
[04/18/18, 7:11:45 AM] <vexelghost> BM? Do I need urban dictionary?
[04/18/18, 7:11:46 AM] ** aypop thinks about it saraaThink
[04/18/18, 7:11:58 AM] <stargazer1977> BM stands for bowel movement.
[04/18/18, 7:11:59 AM] <Andyinsomnia> @vexelghost, Bowel Movement in this case
[04/18/18, 7:12:00 AM] <aypop> badly mannered
[04/18/18, 7:12:07 AM] <aypop> also bowel movement
[04/18/18, 7:12:09 AM] <Ossborn> Blade Master

[04/18/18, 7:14:02 AM] <stargazer1977> Better is a relative term and means different things to different people. My moral standards are a lot different than someone else's.

[04/18/18, 7:14:32 AM] <stargazer1977> With the increasing prevalence of streaming, we will have to adjust accordingly.
[04/18/18, 7:14:34 AM] <CPfalken> @zanixx212 its absolutely is, and its very good that you do it, but most parents dont.

[04/18/18, 7:14:44 AM] <Archmortal> @zanixx212 that doesn't absolve the person actually doing the shitty thing from doing it. They are in fact more responsible for what they do than children that don't know as well.
[04/18/18, 7:14:45 AM] <stargazer1977> Parental controls will have to adjust as well.

[04/18/18, 7:16:30 AM] <EricaTheStrange> it depends what you class as filth @stargazer1977
[04/18/18, 7:16:32 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @stargazer1977 Makes sense to me.
[04/18/18, 7:16:55 AM] <ImKingOfLeague> i wonder if theyd play with me
[04/18/18, 7:17:06 AM] <stargazer1977> Any proper critic of an art form should be just as vociferous to defend the free speech of parts of the medium they don't like as much as the parts they do. Otherwise the next thing censored is your own.
[04/18/18, 7:17:11 AM] <CPfalken> twitch is better at defining its TOS is the biggest joke this century shishLUL
[04/18/18, 7:17:31 AM] <theonlyrealethereal> Agreed. Parents should shield their children from the viewpoints of the left.
[04/18/18, 7:17:46 AM] <Highfarm73> But youtube is american, so nude breasts are a big no no, but severed heads and gore is just fine
[04/18/18, 7:17:48 AM] <Zanixx> lol corephd i agree
[04/18/18, 7:17:57 AM] <Zanixx> my son just finished reading dangerous by milo
[04/18/18, 7:18:07 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Twitch could definitely be better but it is certainly better than most streaming and social media sites at it
[04/18/18, 7:18:19 AM] <stargazer1977> @Highfarm73 exactly my point, what people's morals and standards are is very relative. Especially culturally.
[04/18/18, 7:18:20 AM] <lemoneaterl> freedom of speech has limits, and is not the same in every legal system
[04/18/18, 7:18:38 AM] <Zanixx> freedom of speech only limits when it advocates violence
