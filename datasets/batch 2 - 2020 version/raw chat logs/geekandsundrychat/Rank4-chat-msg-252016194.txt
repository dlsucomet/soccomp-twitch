[04/19/18, 12:42:30 PM] <super390> So we've gone from Shadowrun where magic and cyberpunk mingle in the future, to this game where it's all nostalgia for 1978.

[04/19/18, 12:43:19 PM] <stargazer1977> @Zismarith same, Final Fantasy VI was very influential on me. The first game that I loved so much that I read fanfic of it on the early message boards of the mid-90's.
[04/19/18, 12:43:20 PM] <phoenixgoth> @super390 That'd be amazing xD
[04/19/18, 12:43:22 PM] <vexelghost> Oh, it's The A-Team with magic. I pity the fool who casts firebolt at me.

[04/19/18, 12:45:01 PM] <stargazer1977> Boomboxes was more of an early 1980's thing, since that was the explosion of cassette tapes.
[04/19/18, 12:45:01 PM] <Zismarith> @stargazer1977 It's old enough that I've never even considered FF6 and "fanfic" in the same sentence.
