[04/20/18, 7:03:21 AM] <vexelghost> I've never heard of this world.
[04/20/18, 7:03:26 AM] <KBTibbs> Holy Crap. Monty Cook had such a huge impact on my gaming life.

[04/20/18, 7:06:10 AM] <Defigo> Came in late, what is the book they are talking about?
[04/20/18, 7:06:21 AM] <brucecordell> Numenera
[04/20/18, 7:06:27 AM] <Rourke9> Numenera!
[04/20/18, 7:06:31 AM] <Triamas> Numenera rpg
[04/20/18, 7:06:39 AM] <chaoticloony> @Defigo Numenera with its creator
[04/20/18, 7:07:07 AM] <Rourke9> hence, the ninth world! there have been... at least nine?
[04/20/18, 7:07:18 AM] <Orphan_Kid> gandsHype David
[04/20/18, 7:07:24 AM] <Defigo> Aww, thank you
[04/20/18, 7:07:29 AM] <JC_Wijma> @Ryan It's basically introducing someone from medieval times to Alexa.
[04/20/18, 7:07:33 AM] <vexelghost> Nein world?
[04/20/18, 7:07:46 AM] <Orphan_Kid> yes world nein!
[04/20/18, 7:08:10 AM] <Defigo> Yep nein
[04/20/18, 7:08:35 AM] <Marigolds1> what exactly is numenera
[04/20/18, 7:08:49 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> its a crpg
[04/20/18, 7:08:53 AM] <JC_Wijma> A roleplaying game
[04/20/18, 7:08:54 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> pc game
[04/20/18, 7:09:05 AM] <Marigolds1> is it any good?
[04/20/18, 7:09:09 AM] <HealerOfTheLight> My understanding is the same for now. Magic is a kind of technology. But not like they said doing the ritual and then flipping a switch. Thatâ€™s just dumb. For me the ritual is the tool.
[04/20/18, 7:09:10 AM] <Triamas> pen'n'paper rpg as well
[04/20/18, 7:09:11 AM] <JC_Wijma> No, table top, like D&D
[04/20/18, 7:09:25 AM] <Marigolds1> ah ok
[04/20/18, 7:09:27 AM] <Marigolds1> cool
[04/20/18, 7:09:37 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Man I'm having a hard time dealing with Monte Cook here, he wrote one of my FAVORITE D&D books, The Book Of Vile Darkness.
[04/20/18, 7:09:37 AM] <Zismarith> It's both, Numenara is the setting.
[04/20/18, 7:09:44 AM] <vexelghost> Oh, is there a video game based on this also?
[04/20/18, 7:09:57 AM] <Rourke9> There is also a computer game, Torment: Tides of Numenera
[04/20/18, 7:09:59 AM] <chaoticloony> Numenera are basically a 1 shot magic item that causes problems if you have too many. It is from the Numenera RPG system from Monte Cook!
[04/20/18, 7:10:00 AM] <Marigolds1> is the video game any good?
[04/20/18, 7:10:01 AM] <Zismarith> I kickstarted it.
[04/20/18, 7:10:08 AM] <brucecordell> It's an rpg like D&D where players explore through the ruins of eight previous high tech civilizations, themselves at a medieval tech. Yeah, the video game was licensed from MCG.
[04/20/18, 7:10:16 AM] <Rourke9> The video game is quite good IMO
[04/20/18, 7:10:16 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> also torment planescape?
[04/20/18, 7:10:34 AM] <Zismarith> It's Baldur's Gate/Pillars of Eternity style gameplay, so if you like those, yeah it's good.
[04/20/18, 7:10:56 AM] <Marigolds1> i did like those
[04/20/18, 7:11:05 AM] <chaoticloony> @TheWaveintheDark Tormanr: Tides of Numenera is a spiritual successor to Planescape Torment
[04/20/18, 7:11:06 AM] <vexelghost> Oh, Torment. I knew I read the word Numenera before.
[04/20/18, 7:11:13 AM] <Hasenpfeffer> What time is critical role?
[04/20/18, 7:11:17 AM] <postdataest> http://www.wheniscriticalrole.com/ <<< countdown clock .
[04/20/18, 7:11:23 AM] <LaVengeanceDeSnarckys> @Zismarith iS PILLARS OF ETERNITY ANY GOOD ,
[04/20/18, 7:11:26 AM] <Marigolds1> i like this guys theories behind it
[04/20/18, 7:11:26 AM] <Hasenpfeffer> thanks
[04/20/18, 7:11:27 AM] <chaoticloony> @Crack_Rabbit About 3 hours
[04/20/18, 7:11:27 AM] <Triamas> Stalker!
[04/20/18, 7:11:33 AM] <LaVengeanceDeSnarckys> sorry for capslock
[04/20/18, 7:11:44 AM] <Rourke9> Roadside Picnic also has a game based on it for those interested! It's called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[04/20/18, 7:11:50 AM] <ironsleeve> LaVengeanceDeSnarckys its fantastic
[04/20/18, 7:12:19 AM] <casey_cockroach> Good movie too
[04/20/18, 7:12:20 AM] <LaVengeanceDeSnarckys> @ironsleeve Ok thanks :)
[04/20/18, 7:12:30 AM] <Triamas> there's an pen'n'paper rpg of Stalker as well
[04/20/18, 7:12:32 AM] <Defigo> Sounds like a fun world to explore
[04/20/18, 7:12:33 AM] <Zismarith> @LaVengeanceDeSnarckys If you like that style of RPG, yes it's very good.
[04/20/18, 7:12:37 AM] <MrAbleMinecraft> STALKER is just a good set of games
[04/20/18, 7:12:41 AM] <Zismarith> http://store.steampowered.com/app/272270/Torment_Tides_of_Numenera/
[04/20/18, 7:12:48 AM] <chaoticloony> @Defigo It is
[04/20/18, 7:12:52 AM] <brucecordell> Roadsoad Picnic is a fantastic book to read to get into a Numenera frame of mind.
[04/20/18, 7:12:52 AM] <LaVengeanceDeSnarckys> @Zismarith thanks
[04/20/18, 7:13:00 AM] <Zismarith> :)
[04/20/18, 7:13:09 AM] <vexelghost> So Planescape: Torment is D&D and Torment: Tides of Numenera are completely different RPG systems. Yay! Learning. :D
[04/20/18, 7:13:51 AM] <JoEddy77> evening chat
[04/20/18, 7:14:13 AM] <chaoticloony> Save or Dice has been having a campaign in Numenera.
[04/20/18, 7:14:14 AM] <marissa_kay_sonia> Hi
[04/20/18, 7:14:25 AM] <LaVengeanceDeSnarckys> evening @JoEddy77
[04/20/18, 7:14:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @JoEddy77 @marissa_kay_sonia
[04/20/18, 7:14:31 AM] <brucecordell> Though Planescape (the tabletop RPG) and Tides of Numenera (the tabletop RPG) both had some of the same people working on them ;)
[04/20/18, 7:14:40 AM] <starpilotsix> If you found a smartphone and were at medieval level of technology you might think of it as a handheld lamp with weird runes on it, because you can't get past the password screen, and using it as a lamp might be incredibly useful to you, but you're only using a tiny fraction of its real abilities and not in the intended way.
[04/20/18, 7:14:40 AM] <TheWaveintheDark> arcanum of steamworks and magic obscura is another really gud crpg
[04/20/18, 7:14:46 AM] <marissa_kay_sonia> How are y'all doing?
[04/20/18, 7:14:56 AM] <chaoticloony> @TheWaveintheDark That was such a fungame

[04/20/18, 7:15:21 AM] <ThreeRaccoonsInACoat> Ah, yes. One of my favorite creators talking about one of my favorite games.

[04/20/18, 7:16:12 AM] <ThreeRaccoonsInACoat> Numenera let me have my party fight the very bridge they stood on, which, being a smartfluid, sprouted tentacles, walls, and swordsmen to fight them.
[04/20/18, 7:16:26 AM] <ThreeRaccoonsInACoat> Couldn't just kill the bridge, though. They were on that bridge!
[04/20/18, 7:16:35 AM] <marissa_kay_sonia> I'm doing pretty good, getting ready to make dinner
[04/20/18, 7:16:41 AM] <Triamas> @brucecordell did you work on both? :)
[04/20/18, 7:16:56 AM] <Maxu_P> thats rad
[04/20/18, 7:16:59 AM] <vexelghost> I still wish they'd make a modern game based on Rifts. I have a soft spot for that world from high school.
[04/20/18, 7:17:02 AM] <Maxu_P> hope its a good one
[04/20/18, 7:17:25 AM] <brucecordell> @Triamas hah! Well, I was thinking Monte... but yes now that you mention it, me too
