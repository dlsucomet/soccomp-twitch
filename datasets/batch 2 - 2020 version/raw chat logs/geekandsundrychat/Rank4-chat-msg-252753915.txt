[04/21/18, 6:06:11 AM] <Henchman2121> @danoba The world is somehow oblivious and intentional in it’s cruelty. Melancholy consumes the light of day.
[04/21/18, 6:06:36 AM] <RealMicah> QUESTION: As a horrible power nobody would want, where does Phasing rank, and why?
[04/21/18, 6:06:42 AM] <Henchman2121> @danoba sorry, I needed to be dramatic for a sec.
[04/21/18, 6:06:54 AM] <Danoba> @Henchman2121 I was trying to figure out what happene.

[04/21/18, 6:08:52 AM] <jamesyjables> QUESTION: how accurate was ‘The Martian’ scientifically?
[04/21/18, 6:09:33 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> There is a whole book by Kip Thorne about the physics of Interstellar. They thought through a whole bunch of stuff in making that film.
[04/21/18, 6:09:42 AM] <MaxFiGuy> I loved Intersteller
[04/21/18, 6:09:55 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> It would be worse than a Dyson sphere
[04/21/18, 6:10:01 AM] <tethered_raven> pretty awesome, but could a structure really be in a black hole? :D
[04/21/18, 6:10:19 AM] <1uniqueBeast> QUESTION: Could gravitational waves obscure matter and energy in the universe that we call dark matter and dark energy? Would it make a difference if the universe was pixelated?

[04/21/18, 6:12:10 AM] <Henchman2121> Question: speaking of CGI to demonstrate concepts...where do you stand on using informed artistic license to convey ideas that aren’t fully understood yet, like many concepts in quantum mechanics for example.
[04/21/18, 6:12:12 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> as far IR, it would be negligible
[04/21/18, 6:12:17 AM] <tv_halilo> indestructible beyblade spun by the flash = black hole
