[04/21/18, 7:09:20 AM] ** shidareAKI !sotgiveaways It is safe to assume that if winners are not announced at the end of an episode of SoT, it is because the person drawn has not yet responded to their whispers to confirm that they are eligible to win. PLEASE stay close to your computers so that you can respond to a potential incoming whisper!!
