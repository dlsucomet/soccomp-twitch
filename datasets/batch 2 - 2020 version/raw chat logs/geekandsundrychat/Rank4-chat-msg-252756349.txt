[04/21/18, 12:05:49 PM] <geminilightning> QUESTION: Is Matthew Mercer the most adultest of adults?
[04/21/18, 12:05:49 PM] <autisticcosplay> im jealous of the level of productive erika is.
[04/21/18, 12:05:51 PM] <rasnac_khan> I thought one day I would stop reading comics and playing with toys, but it never happened :/

[04/21/18, 12:06:12 PM] <shidareAKI> I was more like I did not sign up for this when I became an adult.
[04/21/18, 12:06:14 PM] <Biosynthetic13> I'm only adulting because I"m moving! I'm a 35 year old gamer, future cosplayer.
[04/21/18, 12:06:15 PM] <Slippydude> Cant spell Adult without DULT
[04/21/18, 12:06:18 PM] <chuckswain> @OrionLightning he himself would likely say no
[04/21/18, 12:06:18 PM] <Medinaquirin> Good lord this is alarming.

[04/21/18, 12:06:33 PM] <ShandraVdeG> @shidareAKI Yup.....
[04/21/18, 12:06:34 PM] <feathersflight> Is this going to make me feel guilty for failing at doing any adulting recently?
[04/21/18, 12:06:38 PM] <Leleisland > Hi! @misssunflower94
[04/21/18, 12:06:40 PM] <wrathofrathie> @slippydude I will frustrate you with my poor english.
[04/21/18, 12:06:44 PM] <7lizardsinacoat> im almost 20 and so far being an adult is thoroughly terrifying and not fun
[04/21/18, 12:06:45 PM] <rasnac_khan> Phoenix is awesome! :D
[04/21/18, 12:06:47 PM] <chuckswain> @Slippydude think u spell that DOLT :P
[04/21/18, 12:06:49 PM] <KBTibbs> It doesn't end your life... so far.
[04/21/18, 12:06:55 PM] <misssunflower94> hi @Leleisland !!
[04/21/18, 12:07:00 PM] <owifig> Having a kid is one of those make-or-break things. You either become an adult then or things go TERRIBLY wrong
[04/21/18, 12:07:01 PM] <Themonkeyprincess> Well....
[04/21/18, 12:07:13 PM] <Mainnalle> @feathersflight I hope not. the most adulting thing i have done this week is laundry
[04/21/18, 12:07:14 PM] <phoenixgoth> Phoenix is cute, but I want nothing to do with children and pregnancy.
[04/21/18, 12:07:19 PM] <phoenixgoth> Hello Ivan <3
[04/21/18, 12:07:21 PM] <Slippydude> @chuckswain I look forward to being the person whom you frustrate

[04/21/18, 12:08:12 PM] <phoenixgoth> Awww, Vince!
[04/21/18, 12:08:13 PM] <wrathofrathie> I have been trying to adult my mother for years. I think the oldest child often does that. The parents get soft on the later childern
[04/21/18, 12:08:13 PM] <shesoffonatangent> her jewelry is amazing
[04/21/18, 12:08:19 PM] <feathersflight> Congrats @misssunflower94 !!

[04/21/18, 12:08:40 PM] <misssunflower94> oh wow Vince might be the closest to my age on this couch
[04/21/18, 12:08:40 PM] <NeverwinterFool> I'm an adult, I have to start watching what I'm eating and losing weight. D:
[04/21/18, 12:08:44 PM] <phoenixgoth> ... Oh my gosh, Vince is younger than me, I feel suddenly like an idiot.
[04/21/18, 12:08:44 PM] <misssunflower94> hi Vince!
[04/21/18, 12:08:45 PM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> ohh tangy grats!!!
[04/21/18, 12:08:46 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> I'm still trying to figure out how to adult with chronic low energy and demotivation.
[04/21/18, 12:08:50 PM] <Yanni_psd> are you from the series the guild?
[04/21/18, 12:08:53 PM] <phoenixgoth> Same, Tangy, closest in age

[04/21/18, 12:08:54 PM] <wrathofrathie> Woot! to @misssunflower94
[04/21/18, 12:08:55 PM] <LavenderTownsGhost> I'm almost 21 and I still don't think I'm an adult
[04/21/18, 12:08:56 PM] <owifig> This is secretly Vince's surprise bar mitzvah
[04/21/18, 12:08:56 PM] <misssunflower94> Thanks everyone <3

[04/21/18, 12:09:00 PM] <shidareAKI> @yanni_psd yes
[04/21/18, 12:09:00 PM] <chaoticloony> We have loved watching you since you were a kid!

[04/21/18, 12:09:12 PM] <cardinaliron> Vince's looks reminds me of Biff in the altered 1985 in Back to the Future 2.

[04/21/18, 12:09:38 PM] <rasnac_khan> People youndger than 30 should not worry about being an adult etc. Just enjoy 20s while it lasts kids ;)
[04/21/18, 12:09:39 PM] <Lily_habiba> I'm an adult, I have survived an economic crash, now work in customer service and will be working a second half-time job starting Monday
[04/21/18, 12:09:42 PM] <chaoticloony> In Lauren we enjoy!

[04/21/18, 12:10:03 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> Is it just me, or are there very few people on this panel that most people would think of as 'fully qualified' adults? ;)

[04/21/18, 12:10:17 PM] <PSWii2008> I’m 28, and I still don’t feel like an adult.
[04/21/18, 12:10:19 PM] <Lily_habiba> I am also writing a contemporary female-voice response to HP Lovecraft, and I dance
[04/21/18, 12:10:25 PM] <misssunflower94> awwww Lauren you're doing great!
[04/21/18, 12:10:27 PM] <Medinaquirin> No adult is fully qualified, that's the secret.
[04/21/18, 12:10:27 PM] <pixiecat87> I feel like truly becoming an adult has helped me start to have a bit of a childhood.
[04/21/18, 12:10:33 PM] <shidareAKI> 34 and still aggressively avoiding growing up. But adulting is not easy for me.
[04/21/18, 12:10:35 PM] <Medinaquirin> I'm 34 and perpetually terrified.
[04/21/18, 12:10:37 PM] <Lily_habiba> Thanks @NeverwinterFool
[04/21/18, 12:10:42 PM] <TheDiMono> I'm 37 and although I do adulting a lot, I don't consider myself an adult. As long as the only person I have to care for is myself, I don't think I'm there. And I'm okay with that.
[04/21/18, 12:10:43 PM] <starpilotsix> The defining adulting moment that comes to mind for me was buying a pound of corned beef from a grocery store deli, because it was a really good deal. I'd bought other stuff before, but that moment it was, like, wow, I'm an adult.
[04/21/18, 12:10:43 PM] <AlanTucker> 52 and still a questionable adult
[04/21/18, 12:10:46 PM] <feathersflight> @mightbeabadidea_Truth! I think that's the point! :D
[04/21/18, 12:10:52 PM] <Ephsy> OMG Erica's outfit is adorable
[04/21/18, 12:10:56 PM] <wrathofrathie> So true about the second and later kids. First is so special then you learn
[04/21/18, 12:10:56 PM] <phoenixgoth> I'm 28, I'm trained to be a lawyer but I'm sunk in a dead end job that I hate and am taking grad school classes on the side.
[04/21/18, 12:11:01 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> Is starting a business the secret to adulting?
[04/21/18, 12:11:03 PM] <Zismarith> I'm 3x older than all of you combined, and I promise: "adulthood" in the classic sense is massively overrated.
[04/21/18, 12:11:14 PM] <DrBbMath> WTF is an EIN?
[04/21/18, 12:11:15 PM] <Lily_habiba> What's an EIN?
[04/21/18, 12:11:16 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> @shidareAKI I'm pretty sure anyone who says that they're good at Adulting is just faking it to make themselves look good.
[04/21/18, 12:11:17 PM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> QUESTION: what's an EIN?
[04/21/18, 12:11:19 PM] <Themonkeyprincess> ?
[04/21/18, 12:11:19 PM] <LavenderTownsGhost> WHAT IS AN EIN
[04/21/18, 12:11:20 PM] <shidareAKI> @thedimono exactly. It’s when I get into a relationship and a family that I think adulting will really start to kick in

[04/21/18, 12:11:36 PM] <Themonkeyprincess> Ohhh...
[04/21/18, 12:11:37 PM] <LadyFirelyght> Part of being an adult is being able to eat cake for dinner and nobody being able to stop you.
[04/21/18, 12:11:38 PM] <shidareAKI> @mightbeabadidea_ you might be right
[04/21/18, 12:11:39 PM] <OccamsStubble> employer identification number
