[04/25/18, 7:07:16 AM] <Zismarith> Oh, the sound of heartbreak and soul-wrenching insanity?
[04/25/18, 7:07:25 AM] <techweenie> could the lighting me less harsh?

[04/25/18, 7:08:58 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Erika's reaction made me imagine the most crazy stuff being carried in cardboard boxes.
[04/25/18, 7:09:02 AM] <Zismarith> Your people are holding onto many thousands of books in this house.

[04/25/18, 7:10:08 AM] <EricaTheStrange> can we take points away for how bad that joke was @chaoticloony
[04/25/18, 7:11:31 AM] <CrackaBear> uh
[04/25/18, 7:11:56 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Pfft Euros aren't even a real thing. They're basically bit coins.
[04/25/18, 7:11:58 AM] <Gkgamerfan> If the product is bad enough it'd hurt the influencer's brand too
[04/25/18, 7:12:08 AM] <shidareAKI> Howdy do~ gandsGameEngine
[04/25/18, 7:12:14 AM] <The_TBoyce> But if it's an unreleased game, I doubt that the game publisher/distributor would give enough info for a streamer to assess whether that game is right for their channel.
[04/25/18, 7:12:22 AM] <Andyinsomnia> jcvimHi @shidareAKI
[04/25/18, 7:12:27 AM] <The_TBoyce> Howdy @shidareAKI !

[04/25/18, 7:14:38 AM] <The_TBoyce> @shidareAKI Aw, that's a shame. Here's hoping for a weekend with sunny skies!
[04/25/18, 7:14:49 AM] <Leigh574> Hey @chaoticloony Hey @EricaTheStrange Hey @Ossborn Hey @Andyinsomnia :) :) :) :)
[04/25/18, 7:15:03 AM] <Danoba> Hey @Leigh574
[04/25/18, 7:15:10 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry I've looked at stuff, but I'm a researcher by nature, so I do my homework on any purchase.
[04/25/18, 7:15:16 AM] <Leigh574> Hey @Danoba :)
[04/25/18, 7:15:36 AM] <EricaTheStrange> I bought No mans sky when it first came out because I thought it might actually be good even though everyone said it was terrible, they were right but it appears it's gotten a lot better since then
[04/25/18, 7:15:46 AM] <cedon> never bought anything based on what an "influencer" has said/not said about a product
[04/25/18, 7:15:46 AM] <Grimswerth> I bought "Slay the Spire" after seeing it on PennyArcade
[04/25/18, 7:15:50 AM] <Andyinsomnia> I have bought a few games I wasnt planning to because of how fun it was watching it streamed, and backed sundered after seeing it on this show
[04/25/18, 7:16:04 AM] <Nightbot> We have a subscriber-only Discord server! Join here: https://discord.gg/geekandsundry (you'll need to sub and link it to your Twitch) and be a part of the fun!...Warning: It can take up to an hour for the server to update and give you access to the channels
[04/25/18, 7:16:43 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> What game company is this? I want to avoid their products at all costs.
[04/25/18, 7:16:44 AM] <evildoer_goodfornothing> no way! if the product matches the influencer it's win-win for everyone
[04/25/18, 7:16:46 AM] <chaoticloony> No Man's Sky came out the way i expected to, Sean Murray was to childlike when talking about it for me to believe!
[04/25/18, 7:16:48 AM] <ThePizzaTrophy> i'm wearing the same shirt as her, just in a men's cut
[04/25/18, 7:17:01 AM] <WelshAndyT> @GeekandSundry Not so much with products, but with other creator recommendations, Hot Ones and Binging With Babish were recommendations and I followed GnS originally because Trish joined, and I trust her views

[04/25/18, 7:17:23 AM] <chaoticloony> Slay the Spire is a fabulous and fun game
[04/25/18, 7:17:43 AM] <ryanhaire> vainglory host??
[04/25/18, 7:17:56 AM] <The_TBoyce> Which studio is that that feeds the trolls? As a gamer, I wouldn't want to support them.
[04/25/18, 7:18:03 AM] <Dupke87> i'm happy for them to get paid to do something tey like, but i never buy something based of approval of someone i follow because i dont trust it to be a fair review!

[04/25/18, 7:18:15 AM] <Ossborn> I sometimes bought games when I saw them on stream and liked them, like >Darkest Dungeons or Where The Water Tastes Like Wine... but I generally dont care about the "influencers" opinion
