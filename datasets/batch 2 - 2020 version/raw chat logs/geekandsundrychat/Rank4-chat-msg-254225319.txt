[04/25/18, 11:53:54 AM] <Dragonchrome> Tuesday Asinine Wisdome is live 9pm - 10pm PDT
[04/25/18, 11:54:17 AM] <chaoticloony> I still want to know what happened to Asione Wisdom through Asieight Wisdom!
[04/25/18, 11:54:54 AM] <Dragonchrome> Tonight’s guest is Liam O’Brien ( twitter.com/VoiceOfOBrien ),
[04/25/18, 11:54:55 AM] <altacera> That pun is brilliant
[04/25/18, 11:55:08 AM] <Raidrith> Ba dum chhh
[04/25/18, 11:55:26 AM] <Kindness00> Sup sup yall
[04/25/18, 11:55:33 AM] <Zynapse13> Hmmm. Cool. No idea what this show is about but I’ll check anything out with a Critica Role member involved.
[04/25/18, 11:55:35 AM] <Raidrith> Hey @Kindness00
[04/25/18, 11:55:36 AM] <Dragonchrome> Hi @Kindness00
[04/25/18, 11:55:49 AM] <Dragonchrome> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.
[04/25/18, 11:55:51 AM] <JeffM0307> It started as Asinone Wisdom and just kept upgrading
[04/25/18, 11:55:56 AM] <Raidrith> Brace yourself @Zynapse13
[04/25/18, 11:55:57 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Kindness00

[04/25/18, 11:57:55 AM] <Dragonchrome> 3 mins
[04/25/18, 11:58:10 AM] <wrathofrathie> Having listened to some of liam's podcasts with Sam I think he will be able to handle this show just fine. Maybe stump the boys even.
[04/25/18, 11:58:11 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> it’s gonna be a wild time tonight fellas who’s pumped up ??

[04/25/18, 11:58:45 AM] <Zynapse13> @neuroticsilence42 I know! So upset I missed talks. Was watching a food network show that I wasn’t enjoying in its place.
[04/25/18, 11:58:47 AM] <neuroticsilence42> Oh, I will. that's for sure!
[04/25/18, 11:58:49 AM] <LivorMortis> I'm hoping they can top last week's episode... It's gonna be a challenge though, Brian W. Foster had great chemistry with the guys
[04/25/18, 11:58:50 AM] <wrathofrathie> Hi back @raidrith @dragonchrome @chaoticloony
[04/25/18, 11:58:53 AM] <dashdashiell> Hi everybody!
[04/25/18, 11:59:00 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> @astralunicorn that’s a common side effect it’d perfectly natural
[04/25/18, 11:59:06 AM] <Dragonchrome> it's almost time
[04/25/18, 11:59:07 AM] <neuroticsilence42> I was off grocery shopping. Adulting is hard.
[04/25/18, 11:59:10 AM] <chuckswain> @AstralUnicorn is that why your horn is glowing?
[04/25/18, 11:59:13 AM] <Zynapse13> @zedbrandon helloo
[04/25/18, 11:59:14 AM] <Kindness00> Im a little sad i never seen cr campaign1 but im up to date on campaign 2
[04/25/18, 11:59:19 AM] <AstralUnicorn> hundredsofsmallbirds good, thank you :D
[04/25/18, 11:59:27 AM] <AstralUnicorn> :D
[04/25/18, 11:59:32 AM] <Raidrith> Last week's episode was the best one they've done to date. I thing BW Foster should be a guest host @LivorMortis
[04/25/18, 11:59:38 AM] <Archon331> its hard to watch the early campaign 1 videos
[04/25/18, 11:59:38 AM] <Corpsehandler> campaign 1 is a very different beastie
[04/25/18, 11:59:44 AM] <Archon331> quality is very low
