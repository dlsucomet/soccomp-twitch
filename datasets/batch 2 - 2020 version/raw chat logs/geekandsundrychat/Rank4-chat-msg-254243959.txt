[04/25/18, 12:02:52 PM] <SaraSews> As a fellow anosmic person, smell is freaky as fuck
[04/25/18, 12:02:54 PM] <polkadotsass> It's very natural if it came out of a person.
[04/25/18, 12:02:55 PM] <Raidrith> How was the One Woman Show guys?
[04/25/18, 12:02:58 PM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> smell is fake, it’s a govt conspiracy

[04/25/18, 12:03:12 PM] <The1Silent1One> Sometimes the smell just gets trapped in the cushions and doesn't come out till you sit down.
[04/25/18, 12:03:16 PM] <harberst> Smell is absolutely some form of dark magic.
[04/25/18, 12:03:18 PM] <Danciful> It's when you take someone's seat before class but it's still oddly warm from the last student who sat in it

[04/25/18, 12:09:48 PM] <Nightbot> Asinine Wisdom is where common sense and civil discourse go to die. Two idiots (Jake Bennett and Daryl Crittenden) and one unfortunate guest get to the bottom of the issues no one is talking about.
