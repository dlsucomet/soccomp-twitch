[04/26/18, 8:05:09 AM] <johndmcc> @john_sparks_jr I learned of the Guild after SPN
[04/26/18, 8:05:19 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @johndmcc It was Critical Role though, along with D&J and TBDRPG that really cemented my fandom of this channel.
[04/26/18, 8:05:22 AM] <koldun007> That sounded way more sarcastic than I intended, apologies
