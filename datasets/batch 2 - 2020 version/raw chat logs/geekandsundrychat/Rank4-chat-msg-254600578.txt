[04/26/18, 10:08:05 AM] ** shidareAKI This is a very random PSA, but if you live in the northern hemisphere, please take care to hydrate. It's getting hot out there!

[04/26/18, 10:08:26 AM] <artistsomeday> I feel like Taliesin added more bright blue to his hair
[04/26/18, 10:08:27 AM] <japenrose> @phoenixgoth It's good, it's epic poetry style!

[04/26/18, 10:08:41 AM] <Alexanderhero83> That is was 80's
[04/26/18, 10:08:44 AM] <ToonEzon> and with comics it truely is a never ending story, because the rabbit hole is so soooo deep
[04/26/18, 10:08:48 AM] <cinphoria> @artistsomeday I think he's doing that peacock thing he tried and failed to explain to a small child :P
[04/26/18, 10:08:51 AM] <misssunflower94> I always want to congrats daisies when they're in chat
[04/26/18, 10:08:52 AM] <shidareAKI> @Fizonafan I care about you guys!

[04/26/18, 10:09:08 AM] <misssunflower94> Taliesin your hair IS excellent
[04/26/18, 10:09:08 AM] <Fizonafan> tal no
[04/26/18, 10:09:09 AM] <LibrarianLizz> QUESTION: It's much easier for schools to purchase comic books like Raina's through our pre approved government-discounted vendors. Image has started marketing directly to schools as well and is doing really well! Do you think the big comic publishers will find ways to spread their distribution out?
[04/26/18, 10:09:13 AM] <phoenixgoth> Of course you are, Taliesin.
[04/26/18, 10:09:13 AM] <Mx_Kit> its true taliesin
[04/26/18, 10:09:14 AM] <shidareAKI> @cljedi treasure it while you can, the first circle of hell is on the horizon
[04/26/18, 10:09:16 AM] <cinphoria> Indeed

[04/26/18, 10:09:18 AM] <axe_lobo_galen> @japenrose speaking of Tolkien I kinda wanna also dive into the silmarillion since someone gave a good rec for it
[04/26/18, 10:09:21 AM] <fireshadowktreva> but your hair IS excellent
[04/26/18, 10:09:23 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Taliesin Jaffe hair is Awesome
[04/26/18, 10:09:24 AM] <Gerridwynn9> lol
[04/26/18, 10:09:28 AM] <Roystealer> I mean it's true tho Taliesin
[04/26/18, 10:09:29 AM] <cinphoria> JANE! \o/ is this our mod Jane?
[04/26/18, 10:09:30 AM] <Mx_Kit> oh hai tumblr
[04/26/18, 10:09:30 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> can confirm my tumblr is run by Taliesin
[04/26/18, 10:09:30 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @shidareAKI I was just out here in Io-way and thinking it would be a few short weeks before it will be uncomfortably hot again, yay, "moderate climates"
[04/26/18, 10:09:31 AM] <misssunflower94> @jessieleaf shhhhhhhhh
[04/26/18, 10:09:32 AM] <artistsomeday> @cinphoria I think so too but I feel like he added more blue so there wasn't so much teal
[04/26/18, 10:09:33 AM] <sp_acevex> OH HEY THATS ME!!
[04/26/18, 10:09:36 AM] <phoenixgoth> That is an AMAZING class.

[04/26/18, 10:09:46 AM] <cinphoria> wooo
[04/26/18, 10:09:46 AM] <fireshadowktreva> That sounds amazing!
[04/26/18, 10:09:47 AM] <igilboa1> New theory: Taliesin is intentionally planting all of those tumblr theories about his true nature to get us further away from the truth.
[04/26/18, 10:09:47 AM] <shidareAKI> @Deathstar_Taco RIP
[04/26/18, 10:09:47 AM] <misssunflower94> HI JANE!
