[04/27/18, 7:04:18 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @YeahYeah_
[04/27/18, 7:04:20 AM] <Yamifira> leggings
[04/27/18, 7:04:29 AM] <b0risssss> awkward
[04/27/18, 7:04:37 AM] <stargazer1977> Ryan always wears leggings under his pants with holes in them.
[04/27/18, 7:04:48 AM] <b0risssss> the guy has a boner
[04/27/18, 7:04:49 AM] <stargazer1977> It's his style.
[04/27/18, 7:04:53 AM] <Konanda1> interesting
[04/27/18, 7:04:54 AM] <Zismarith> Would necromancers be . . . blood artists? Corpse artists? Man, there's a thinker.
[04/27/18, 7:05:05 AM] <BigTunaNeal> @yeahyeah_ hi
[04/27/18, 7:05:05 AM] <Yamifira> ryan makes leggings fashionable

[04/27/18, 7:08:21 AM] <Salbastro> Are the muscles on Ryan's knee leggings or are they part of the jeans?
[04/27/18, 7:08:27 AM] <BigTunaNeal> @yeahyeah_ wasted time spent with you :)
[04/27/18, 7:08:35 AM] <chaoticloony> Leggings
[04/27/18, 7:08:36 AM] <Yamifira> speaking of D&D im joining a oneshot sunday as a tortle mystic (mystic is from unearthed arcana)
[04/27/18, 7:08:37 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> who might our illustrious guest be?
[04/27/18, 7:08:45 AM] <vexelghost> They're leggings.
[04/27/18, 7:08:52 AM] <Salbastro> I approve of these leggings
[04/27/18, 7:08:59 AM] <stargazer1977> !whodat
[04/27/18, 7:09:00 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green ( twitter.com/HydroSnail ), Kfir Mendel (twitter.com/cavegeekart ).
[04/27/18, 7:09:00 AM] <davehollandart> Kfir Mendel, otherwise known as Cave Geek
[04/27/18, 7:09:03 AM] <chaoticloony> @Yamifira Have fun, that is a cool combo
[04/27/18, 7:09:18 AM] <KittysuneODoom> Witcher is set in the Northern Kingdoms, technically within Tamriel
[04/27/18, 7:09:22 AM] <Yamifira> i based my char of the turtle dude from kung fu panda

[04/27/18, 7:09:29 AM] <bobadylan> is this the critical role stream?
[04/27/18, 7:09:43 AM] <chaoticloony> @bobadylan In about 3 hours
[04/27/18, 7:09:53 AM] <vexelghost> Witcher is not in Tamriel.
[04/27/18, 7:09:55 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> tyvm @stargazer1977
[04/27/18, 7:10:10 AM] <bobadylan> okay thanks @chaoticloony
[04/27/18, 7:10:13 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> and tyvm @BeefSupreme13
[04/27/18, 7:10:19 AM] <Yamifira> why worry about when critical role when you can enjoy ryan and whomever is his guest for the evening discuss interesting topics
[04/27/18, 7:10:24 AM] <chaoticloony> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cavegeekart/zodiac-constellations-recreating-antique-maps-of-t
[04/27/18, 7:11:23 AM] <vexelghost> I really hope by burning skins he's not making an accurate Necronomicon.
[04/27/18, 7:11:50 AM] <CharacterStigma> BlessRNG Maps are awesome in Tolkien novels
[04/27/18, 7:11:59 AM] <davehollandart> the necronomicon wishes
[04/27/18, 7:12:19 AM] <KittysuneODoom> My bad, speed sightreading ftl
[04/27/18, 7:12:32 AM] <BigTunaNeal> Nevronomicon? I'll suggest that next
[04/27/18, 7:12:43 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> would it be like 1/100th the cost if he just used pennyskin instead of buckskin?
[04/27/18, 7:12:51 AM] <KittysuneODoom> That would be rather epic to see his worm on, lol
[04/27/18, 7:12:55 AM] <KittysuneODoom> *work
[04/27/18, 7:13:08 AM] <davehollandart> he has to use buckskin for this method and it has to be natural brain-tanned buckskin
[04/27/18, 7:13:14 AM] <davehollandart> almost nothing else really works correctly
[04/27/18, 7:13:27 AM] <nat3y> mate
[04/27/18, 7:13:31 AM] <Yamifira> the only map i remember from my head is the might&magic 7 map( which i got next to me as i write)
[04/27/18, 7:13:37 AM] <Spartandave7> Hey guys when is critical role?
[04/27/18, 7:13:42 AM] <BigTunaNeal> Freudian slip @kittyodooom ?
[04/27/18, 7:13:46 AM] <stargazer1977> I've burned on buckskin many times in my youth. It was part of growing up where I did. Scouts always routinely worked on buckskin.
[04/27/18, 7:13:47 AM] <nat3y> cunr
[04/27/18, 7:13:51 AM] <davehollandart> lol
[04/27/18, 7:13:55 AM] <Syndro_Deathblade> same time as last week
[04/27/18, 7:13:58 AM] ** KittysuneODoom shifty eyes
[04/27/18, 7:14:19 AM] <NigelQB> suup
[04/27/18, 7:14:19 AM] <davehollandart> SUP DUDE!
[04/27/18, 7:14:29 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> so all he needs is a zombie army to gather brains for mass production...
[04/27/18, 7:14:34 AM] <Spartandave7> @syndro_deathblade I’m new here buddy saw a vid on YouTube so don’t know the start time
[04/27/18, 7:14:43 AM] <davehollandart> you're assuming he doesn't have the army
[04/27/18, 7:14:47 AM] <KittysuneODoom> Hiiiiiii!
[04/27/18, 7:15:04 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I sit corrected @BeefSupreme13
[04/27/18, 7:15:14 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehehe
[04/27/18, 7:15:14 AM] <BigTunaNeal> @beefsupreme13 have you used a wood burner to sculpt buckskin before?
[04/27/18, 7:15:22 AM] <vexelghost> I smell time capsule!
[04/27/18, 7:15:38 AM] ** KittysuneODoom is not a zombie cat but is good at fetching things, time to hunt brains
