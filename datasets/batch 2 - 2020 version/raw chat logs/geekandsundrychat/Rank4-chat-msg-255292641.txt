[04/28/18, 6:05:16 AM] <Nightbot> To make it easier to read questions in chat, please preface your questions with the word question in all caps. For example, QUESTION: How are you today?
[04/28/18, 6:05:25 AM] <Kat_Waterflame> Is he writing backwards, or just writing forwards and the visual is flipped?
[04/28/18, 6:05:31 AM] <Henchman2121> I love how “infinity is weird” would be just at home in a show about getting stoned.
[04/28/18, 6:05:32 AM] <TrainerTauri> how much would Jörmungandr the world serpent have to eat daily
[04/28/18, 6:05:33 AM] <Ossborn> No spoilers! https://i.imgur.com/tvRRhG8.gifv
[04/28/18, 6:05:38 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I'd say Infinity is less weird by this math if you do not do any rounding, I mean, basing this on the premise of rounding is a simplification of overly long math that has minimal practical purpose.

[04/28/18, 6:06:28 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I'd say .999... is only =1 in a practical, not technical sense.
[04/28/18, 6:07:00 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> I figured it was astrogeology.... @SultanOfShred

[04/28/18, 6:07:40 AM] <aeisenmann> @Kat_Waterflame I think he has practiced a lot and is writing backwards. He sometimes looks down so maybe he's checking legibility in a mirror?

[04/28/18, 6:13:22 AM] <Henchman2121> Force powers are broken up into control, sense, and alter. Somewhere in there it seems like you could find the ability of flight.
