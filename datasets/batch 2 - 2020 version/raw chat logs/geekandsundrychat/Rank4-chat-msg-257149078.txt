[05/3/18, 10:03:08 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Hi @JodyHouser :)
[05/3/18, 10:03:13 AM] <misssunflower94> Taliesin is dishonest and we can trust him to be dishonest
[05/3/18, 10:03:15 AM] <halfaringcircus> We've established that Amy couldn't even be in the room when other students were lying without tattling.
[05/3/18, 10:03:16 AM] <herladykrow> Tal is the shady slytherin friend
[05/3/18, 10:03:23 AM] <cinphoria> good teacher xD

[05/3/18, 10:03:31 AM] <blamecarla> Hi @misssunflower94
[05/3/18, 10:03:37 AM] <Hazgarn> "Lies" is literally in the middle of his name.
[05/3/18, 10:03:38 AM] <101deadpool1017> Taliesin was a child actor, of course he can lie
[05/3/18, 10:03:42 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @jodyhouser Is a TimeLord
[05/3/18, 10:03:43 AM] <japenrose> Oh yeah that is always a good lesson from a teacher
[05/3/18, 10:03:46 AM] <phoenixgoth> That's a very good lesson, Matt!
[05/3/18, 10:03:47 AM] <misssunflower94> great teachers teach you to lie lol
[05/3/18, 10:03:51 AM] <feathersflight> Amy ILU
[05/3/18, 10:03:52 AM] <misssunflower94> Hello everyone <3
[05/3/18, 10:03:55 AM] <feathersflight> So true
[05/3/18, 10:03:57 AM] <giljaxon> BIG MOOD
[05/3/18, 10:03:59 AM] <complainthat> "something, something, plate tectonics."
[05/3/18, 10:03:59 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm not fond of that lesson, frankly. I don't care if you sound correct or not, I only care if you are correct.
[05/3/18, 10:04:00 AM] <phoenixgoth> Yeah, women are trained to "soften" our tones
[05/3/18, 10:04:00 AM] <cinphoria> oh mood, Amy
[05/3/18, 10:04:01 AM] <AromiaFlyce> im so happy about todays episode
[05/3/18, 10:04:03 AM] <owifig> Yeah - Amy w/ the truth
[05/3/18, 10:04:08 AM] <igilboa1> I thank Amy everyday.
[05/3/18, 10:04:08 AM] <artistsomeday> And thats how misinformation is spread kids :D
[05/3/18, 10:04:10 AM] <JodyHouser> I'm writing a Time Lord right now. )
[05/3/18, 10:04:11 AM] <phoenixgoth> That's genius, Taliesin
[05/3/18, 10:04:13 AM] <likesthevillain> Confidence is key. You can get away with saying so much if you say it confidently.
[05/3/18, 10:04:15 AM] <cy0nknight> That's some deep wisdom Talesin
[05/3/18, 10:04:16 AM] <CLJedi> TOPIC: Farenheit 451 style all comic books are about to be destroyed. you have one entire series you can memorize and embody, which one do you pick? do you go with you favorite or the most culturally impacting/important?
[05/3/18, 10:04:16 AM] <cinphoria> (well, I never do it, even though I probably should've)
[05/3/18, 10:04:16 AM] <safespaceinvador> Goth Dad </3

[05/3/18, 10:04:28 AM] <brassmama> Shout out to Amy from a Valk up in Washington
[05/3/18, 10:04:30 AM] <herladykrow> Taliesin: Yes I lied. I give the truth scope.
[05/3/18, 10:04:31 AM] <Tommydee92> Drinking game? This German is intrigued
[05/3/18, 10:04:39 AM] <cy0nknight> I think Talesin's grandpa and my grandpa would get along really well
[05/3/18, 10:04:43 AM] <halfaringcircus> There's cats and dogs and camels coming down out there. Egads.
[05/3/18, 10:04:45 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> i love getting this sick taliesin backstory
[05/3/18, 10:04:49 AM] <phoenixgoth> That's *amazing*
[05/3/18, 10:04:50 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> :D
[05/3/18, 10:04:54 AM] <cinphoria> oh Taliesin's grandpa *shakes head*
[05/3/18, 10:04:54 AM] <mathemagician_> That's so good
[05/3/18, 10:04:55 AM] <Prideling> That... explains so much
[05/3/18, 10:04:55 AM] <AromiaFlyce> that sounds awesome
[05/3/18, 10:04:59 AM] <misssunflower94> That's so much work just to be full of shit
[05/3/18, 10:05:00 AM] <Tommydee92> I love it XD
[05/3/18, 10:05:00 AM] <emilydawn96> i really want the goth dad shirt
[05/3/18, 10:05:01 AM] <GreyAngel> dang
[05/3/18, 10:05:02 AM] <likesthevillain> ...that's genius.
[05/3/18, 10:05:04 AM] <cinphoria> @misssunflower94 right??
[05/3/18, 10:05:05 AM] <AromiaFlyce> YES Texas!
[05/3/18, 10:05:05 AM] <rustyredguy> oh right, it's not Thursday. Nevermind
[05/3/18, 10:05:06 AM] <blamecarla> Hi MAtt, Taliesin and Amy!
[05/3/18, 10:05:07 AM] <philbe63> What's the theme for tonight?
[05/3/18, 10:05:08 AM] <nebulaprinz> thats what i aspire to be omg
[05/3/18, 10:05:10 AM] <TakaraOtN6> XD
[05/3/18, 10:05:10 AM] <starpilotsix> But you miss out on all the sweet interior meats of the books!
[05/3/18, 10:05:13 AM] <japenrose> That's the level of brilliance I want to achieve when I am older
[05/3/18, 10:05:14 AM] <Furbzalicious> So Taliesin's grandpa is Mollymauk?
[05/3/18, 10:05:17 AM] <artistsomeday> w o w. So being extra is apparently genetic
[05/3/18, 10:05:19 AM] <misssunflower94> Hi matt's dad!
[05/3/18, 10:05:19 AM] <KnightGaunt> QUESTION: Have you or will you ever do a bit about Drinky Crow? or are single strip 3 panel comics below the calibre of discussion?
[05/3/18, 10:05:22 AM] <JeffM0307> @philbe63 Warren Ellis
[05/3/18, 10:05:22 AM] <phoenixgoth> Nope, Key parents not here yet
[05/3/18, 10:05:22 AM] <cy0nknight> Texas?! Holy crap, my mom's side of the family is from there
[05/3/18, 10:05:25 AM] <feathersflight> It's clear where Taliesin got his style from
[05/3/18, 10:05:25 AM] <cinphoria> @Furbzalicious I mean, he did write Mollymauk :P
[05/3/18, 10:05:26 AM] <MeggieMay328> sounds like blarney city - which would be my dad's family (we didn't have many males on either side of my family)
[05/3/18, 10:05:27 AM] <phoenixgoth> I actually checked lol
[05/3/18, 10:05:28 AM] <ladyamphy> Clip that story
[05/3/18, 10:05:28 AM] <AromiaFlyce> We in Texas have that BS-Gene, this is a fact
[05/3/18, 10:05:33 AM] <Tommydee92> Most grandpaps are major bullshiters XD
[05/3/18, 10:05:33 AM] <ToonEzon> so thats why my dad was such a good story teller
[05/3/18, 10:05:38 AM] <misssunflower94> @Furbzalicious Taliesin is from a family of Mollymauks
[05/3/18, 10:05:38 AM] <hundredsofsmallbirds> sup Matt’s dad!!
[05/3/18, 10:05:45 AM] <101deadpool1017> I heard of the Texas Sharpshooter, never heard of the Texas bullshitter
[05/3/18, 10:05:45 AM] <AromiaFlyce> Heyyyyyyyyy he is right
[05/3/18, 10:05:47 AM] <Slippydude> Orange COWnty
[05/3/18, 10:05:53 AM] <chaoticloony> I looked my DM in the eye and with a straight face, i lied to him while cracking up inside! The Frost Giant merchant then rolled a 20 and totally believed me.
[05/3/18, 10:05:53 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Yes
[05/3/18, 10:05:53 AM] <Furbzalicious> Taliesin is a true carney
[05/3/18, 10:05:54 AM] <ToonEzon> and thats where my brother gets his awesome brown nosing skills
[05/3/18, 10:05:54 AM] <Praxagorathesmophoria> Among the Irish, it isn't BS it's Blarney and a well cultivated skill
[05/3/18, 10:05:55 AM] <AromiaFlyce> I am from Dallas...
[05/3/18, 10:05:56 AM] <halfaringcircus> Goin' down to cow town? Live beneath the ocean?

[05/3/18, 10:05:58 AM] <brassmama> Is Goth Dad Taliesin or is Goth Dad as in Dream Daddies?
[05/3/18, 10:06:05 AM] <likesthevillain> Orange County of Dallas? Isn't that all of Dallas?
[05/3/18, 10:06:07 AM] <owifig> I am so interested to see the brilliant segue they use to bring this all around to the topic
[05/3/18, 10:06:09 AM] <nebulaprinz> yes

[05/3/18, 10:09:05 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: what was your first Warren Ellis book/what got you hooked on his writing?
[05/3/18, 10:09:13 AM] <foxbelle> I just have to say all these deep and thought filled discussions on the Wednesday club was the finial push for me to go to Full Sail.

[05/3/18, 10:10:05 AM] <Funcokler_Xerow> meh, 'side' sounds better. anyway, Warren Ellis!
[05/3/18, 10:10:16 AM] <Smarcey> The only thing Ive read from Ellis is Orbiter, and the first issue or Planetary. I enjoyed both alot
[05/3/18, 10:10:17 AM] <likesthevillain> @cinphoria i almost said that
[05/3/18, 10:10:18 AM] <RMutt1917> @brassmama i read Vol. 1. Really liked it, looking forward to Vol 2
[05/3/18, 10:10:19 AM] <brassmama> @hellbore64 That is very on brand for comics.
[05/3/18, 10:10:25 AM] <MarryMeBeau> there's a ton of cool futurism stuff in french comics
[05/3/18, 10:10:26 AM] <cinphoria> @hellbore64 that's not a very good codename huh? :/
[05/3/18, 10:10:28 AM] <misssunflower94> you would think there would be more science-y scifi in comics....
[05/3/18, 10:10:34 AM] <justjohnforever> Properly, it *should* be pronounced "dark-side" Darkseid (similar to my last name, "Preis", pronounced "Price")
[05/3/18, 10:10:36 AM] <CLJedi> The "John Hurt" Voice
[05/3/18, 10:10:37 AM] <cy0nknight> @Smarcey You need to read Planetary. It's very very good
[05/3/18, 10:10:41 AM] <Vhaewyn> Damien Hellstrom, aka Hellstorm or the Son of Satan
[05/3/18, 10:10:41 AM] <Tommydee92> Hey, we Brits are not dru...crab... damn it
[05/3/18, 10:10:58 AM] <brassmama> @RMutt1917 That and Injection are pretty much the best things that Ellis has ongoing RN.

[05/3/18, 10:11:31 AM] <101deadpool1017> @misssunflower94 It makes sense because it so easy to publish plup sci fi stories.So most writers don't have to going through comic book channels to do it
[05/3/18, 10:11:31 AM] <zepaddon> why dont the cheer bit messages get pinned to the top of the chat for a short time anymore?
