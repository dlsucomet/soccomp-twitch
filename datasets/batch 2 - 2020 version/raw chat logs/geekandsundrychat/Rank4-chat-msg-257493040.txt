[05/4/18, 7:02:02 AM] <0xFFF1> that's the issue with content creators that get too big. they no longer have time to notice their individual fans

[05/4/18, 7:02:21 AM] <SizzleScramTheGoblin> You might try and find a local discord channel for critical role, otherwise you may find that you don't enjoy chatting during the show. :)

[05/4/18, 7:06:04 AM] <Vaetrem> thx dragonchrome :)
[05/4/18, 7:06:09 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @0xFFF1 are the inner machinations of your mind an enigma wrapped in mystery or just bacon?
[05/4/18, 7:06:12 AM] <Felgalund> @ChronoTravis I think the White March content is better than the base game

[05/4/18, 7:07:26 AM] <bobadylan> how long until critical role?
[05/4/18, 7:07:41 AM] <Dragonchrome> !wheniscr
[05/4/18, 7:07:42 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role is on at 7 PM PDT on Thursdays, it is currently 4:07 PM PDT on Thursday. There is 2 Hours, 52 Minutes, 19 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 933 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[05/4/18, 7:07:48 AM] <chaoticloony> @bobadylan about 3 hours
[05/4/18, 7:08:05 AM] <TCarlini> The Wild West sea's
[05/4/18, 7:08:06 AM] <z_Liquid> He didn't know what deadfire was?
[05/4/18, 7:08:09 AM] <bobadylan> okay thank you
[05/4/18, 7:08:28 AM] <z_Liquid> Looks like he didn't play the first
[05/4/18, 7:08:53 AM] <Danoba> @z_Liquid He's asking questions for those in chat who have not played.
[05/4/18, 7:08:57 AM] <Tyrol_Aspenleaf> pretty fired up for this
[05/4/18, 7:09:00 AM] <vexelghost> He's asking for the audience. I'm sure Ryan has played it.
[05/4/18, 7:09:04 AM] <The_TBoyce> I saw "Lore of Pillars of Eternity" on Twitter, and I came running! What have I missed?!?
[05/4/18, 7:09:32 AM] <Thanedarkone> have it pre-orderd cant wat
[05/4/18, 7:09:47 AM] <Zismarith> Yeah, I gotta finish the first. Someday . . .
[05/4/18, 7:09:56 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> Trust @Danoba he's like a master at the Jenga-likes
[05/4/18, 7:10:04 AM] <Tyrol_Aspenleaf> kinda worried about only having 5 in party instead of 6 :(
[05/4/18, 7:10:33 AM] <vexelghost> Should I buy the first one? I'm not a huge isometric RPG guy.
[05/4/18, 7:10:34 AM] <Dellago> My watcher in POE is from Deadfire, it's gonna be cool to go to her homeland
[05/4/18, 7:10:52 AM] <itskizzle> ^ same for me!!
[05/4/18, 7:11:11 AM] <Buffloaf> ^ same too! Deadfire represent
[05/4/18, 7:11:18 AM] <Tyrol_Aspenleaf> first one was awesome, If you are a baldurs gate game type fan
[05/4/18, 7:11:20 AM] <itskizzle> the pirate life is For Me
[05/4/18, 7:11:24 AM] <Nanawatzin> @yerboykizzle hide Morgwin ;p
[05/4/18, 7:11:36 AM] <Dellago> Former pirate from Deadfire, it's gonna be like going back to your bad habits
[05/4/18, 7:11:37 AM] <pieropd> For combat like 5 just as 6, but for the story yes, the more the better :c
[05/4/18, 7:11:41 AM] <kabney> Is the story on par with planescape torment in terms of weird settings and characters?
[05/4/18, 7:11:48 AM] <itskizzle> she couldn't hide if she tried her best xD @Nanawatzin
[05/4/18, 7:12:09 AM] <Darkbane69> I Want Ash vs Evil Dead The Game for PC

[05/4/18, 7:12:27 AM] <kailaasa> Sigh. I need to win the lottery. I have so many games I need to finish, and work really gets in the way
[05/4/18, 7:12:30 AM] <Nanawatzin> @yerboykizzle at least keep her away from Basmir... we don't want to see him turning into a puddle xD
[05/4/18, 7:12:44 AM] <vexelghost> Wonder if the first will be on sale on Steam.
[05/4/18, 7:12:49 AM] <Matched> My PC is from the Living Lands SeemsGoof
[05/4/18, 7:12:55 AM] <Matched> SeemsGood
[05/4/18, 7:13:37 AM] <coolcoollo> more like VAIN republic
[05/4/18, 7:14:00 AM] <Tyrol_Aspenleaf> not sure if i want to import my save or start a new character with the multiclassing stuff.
[05/4/18, 7:14:03 AM] <itskizzle> ^^ correct
[05/4/18, 7:14:48 AM] <chigen_atomic> I'm excited to see the Living Lands, eventually
[05/4/18, 7:14:51 AM] <Matched> Do both. The aave only carries over choices you made. You still have to recreate your character.
[05/4/18, 7:14:52 AM] <Nanawatzin> @Tyrol_Aspenleaf you can multiclass even if you import your save :) It's more like a world state.
[05/4/18, 7:14:52 AM] <simonthezealot> josh sawyer said on tumblr that you can change ANYTHING about an imported save, so you can do both afaik
[05/4/18, 7:15:12 AM] <god_konquers> how long before critical role ?
[05/4/18, 7:15:18 AM] <Danoba> !wheniscr
[05/4/18, 7:15:19 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role is on at 7 PM PDT on Thursdays, it is currently 4:15 PM PDT on Thursday. There is 2 Hours, 44 Minutes, 42 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 934 times but has probably been asked about way more.
[05/4/18, 7:15:19 AM] <vexelghost> The backstory builder mentioned sounds similar to what they did in Dragon Age Inquisition.
[05/4/18, 7:15:27 AM] <Tyrol_Aspenleaf> ahh nice, so you can reroll your stats etc just keep world state nice
[05/4/18, 7:15:30 AM] <Shadow10380> 2 hours 45 min.
[05/4/18, 7:15:38 AM] <Matched> Exactly :)
[05/4/18, 7:15:39 AM] <albert36> @vexelghost kind of
