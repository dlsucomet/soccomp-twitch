[05/5/18, 7:07:20 AM] <AlchemistiD> There's a BSG board game and it's paranoia incarnate

[05/5/18, 7:09:35 AM] <The_TBoyce> For the record, it is totally my head-canon that Sage becomes Captain of the USS Sally Ride after Martinez gets promoted to Admiral.
[05/5/18, 7:09:43 AM] <Paladin356> @Danoba it went through, but for whatever reason when i try to message you back it just deletes the message
