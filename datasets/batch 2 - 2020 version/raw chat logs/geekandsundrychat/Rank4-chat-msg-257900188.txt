[05/5/18, 12:05:18 PM] <stargazer1977> @Splattercatt you are arguing semantics at that point when all you would have to do is specify Euro Fantasy or Japanese Fantasy or any other example. That smacks of Euro centric bias even more than it does laziness. But do whatever you want.

[05/5/18, 12:07:38 PM] <harberst> @Chovexani You might be able to open up the notebook and place something heavy-ish (like a book) on top of the page you want scanned. That can require some balancing you don't accidentally drop the notebook and cause the page to rip out.

[05/5/18, 12:11:51 PM] <canaahawke> Tal dressed as himself is still dressed as a fae, so it's all good.
[05/5/18, 12:11:53 PM] <Slippydude> QUESTION: did you make the people?
[05/5/18, 12:11:55 PM] <Themushroomderp> We're so used to Tal's fashion always being slightly off, it's hard to tell when he's wearing a costume or not xD

[05/5/18, 12:12:20 PM] <Splattercatt> @GreyAngel I'm fairly certain Tal is a Timelord, so he probably did dress like this at one point in history. :D

[05/5/18, 12:13:46 PM] <The_TBoyce> Kari Byron was on Because Science earlier and she was just in awe of how everyone in LA is young and beautiful.
[05/5/18, 12:13:46 PM] <harberst> ... suddenly I have an urge to make costumes for my bunny. Although he'd probably bite me if I tried to get him to wear anything. Urge passed.
[05/5/18, 12:13:47 PM] <GreyAngel> @The_TBoyce only Erika knows
[05/5/18, 12:13:48 PM] <Leigh574> she does amazing work.

[05/5/18, 12:14:21 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> Real life needs more fantasy, dammit.
[05/5/18, 12:14:23 PM] <chaoticloony> Just remember that although many of the hosts of the channel are attractive, there's much more to them than that. For example, Becca is also incredibly evil.
[05/5/18, 12:14:26 PM] <vexelghost> I'm too stuck-up to dress up.
[05/5/18, 12:14:27 PM] <ToonEzon> question for mods, what's the topic for tonight, also, is tal wearing tiny eartips, or is it covered by his awesome hair
[05/5/18, 12:14:29 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Her horn is glowing! <3
