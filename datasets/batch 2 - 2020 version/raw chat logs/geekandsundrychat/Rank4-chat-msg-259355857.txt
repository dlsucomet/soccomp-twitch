[05/9/18, 12:05:11 PM] <The_TBoyce> It is passed on. This show is no more. It has ceased to be. It is expired and gone to meet its makers. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If it wasn't nailed to the set, it'd be pushing up daisies. It's metabolic processes are now history. It's kicked the bucket. It's shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleeding choir invisible. This is an ex-show.

[05/9/18, 12:07:50 PM] <The_TBoyce> I'm just wondering what blackmail these two have on Dan Casey.
[05/9/18, 12:07:58 PM] <Aveneg> Was looking forward to this all week...there better be more episodes!
[05/9/18, 12:08:01 PM] <Journeyman0186> I don't want these guys to be gone forever, but according to what I've seen, AYBGF will be in this slot next week and you know what? That's very awesome. The powers that be probably have something similar in line, but I believe G&S should have one quarter of serious cultural talk and interpretation from the black perspective, and then one quarter of... this.
[05/9/18, 12:08:05 PM] <TheDiMono> @chuckswain Danoba is always watching. He's like an emu.

[05/9/18, 12:09:39 PM] <Darastrygat> Crap! Dan Casey has 3 first names! He is statistically an assassin or serial killer!
