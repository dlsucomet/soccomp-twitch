[05/10/18, 10:10:26 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: how was everyone's Free Comic Book Day?
[05/10/18, 10:10:26 AM] <halfaringcircus> I could have picked that up at my local flea market for 2 or 3 $ back in the 90s. The same dealer that I grabbed my Howard the Duck from had all of Ms. Marvel and Dazzler.
[05/10/18, 10:10:34 AM] <rasnac_khan> if an item is bought as a collecting item, it should be handled as a collecting item. Collectors have responsibily of keeping that item in best condition for future generations.
