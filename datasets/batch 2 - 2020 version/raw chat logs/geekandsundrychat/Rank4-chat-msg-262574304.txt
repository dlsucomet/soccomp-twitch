[05/18/18, 9:54:13 AM] <ragnarok_avatar> The Mighty NEIN has had a week to choose to either accept the request to be legionaries or not, but this is just my opinion, take the request, but the condition is leave military problems to the real military. In other words they won't handle rebels, deserters, or traitors, just focus on matters related to the people.
