[05/18/18, 10:10:08 AM] <Sileet> there was a scene like this in the Legend of Drizzit. (Terrible character design when put to paper). A huntsman had a fairy that was helping him tracik down the Drow protagonist and after one point the huntsman got so put out that when the fairy jumped into the bag that he used to travel with the huntsman, the huntsman closed the bag all the way up and began to smash it on the ground. Thanks Sam for bringing up fond memories of annoying things getting SMASHED!!!
