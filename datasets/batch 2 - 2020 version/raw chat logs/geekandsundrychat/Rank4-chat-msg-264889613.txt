[05/24/18, 10:06:38 AM] <MeggieMay328> I actually didn't see the film until early 78 though. It took that long for it to get to where I live in the US. I had read the book by that point - the book was a very important piece of my childhood :)

[05/24/18, 10:09:06 AM] <phoenixgoth> Star Wars was my first fandom, and my parents disapproved of it because it was "too violent". >.>
[05/24/18, 10:09:11 AM] <MeggieMay328> The movie made the TV news and if you lived close enough to a bigger city you might have gone the first week
[05/24/18, 10:09:18 AM] <ToonEzon> @mods id like to throw up that clip of bill murry singing the star wars loung theme song
[05/24/18, 10:09:19 AM] <Nate_BB> Both parents saw it in theatres upon release. One of my aunts saw it at the Chinese in LA opening weekend. It’s in my blood lol.
[05/24/18, 10:09:29 AM] <ToonEzon> wow that is awesome
[05/24/18, 10:09:31 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: where do you place the difference - if any - between Scifi and Space Fantasy?
[05/24/18, 10:09:31 AM] <skuNk_citY> Star Trek is way better than those other Treks

[05/24/18, 10:10:10 AM] <MeggieMay328> @stargazer1977 I found the novel on a family trip and remember working up to ask my mom to buy it for me and then reading it as we drover home (and there was bad weather (tornado) behind us.
[05/24/18, 10:10:11 AM] <shidareAKI> we're flying!

[05/24/18, 10:10:17 AM] <RealMicah> Chief goes for the whole budget on ILF effects.
[05/24/18, 10:10:18 AM] <101deadpool1017> Is it hyper space or just snowing the geek & sundry studios?
[05/24/18, 10:10:20 AM] <AromiaFlyce> WHAAAAAAAA

[05/24/18, 10:10:51 AM] <geekmomma3> They are driving in a snowstorm. LOL
[05/24/18, 10:10:51 AM] <FuffyButt> Star Wars was a Star Gateway to comic nerd-dom
[05/24/18, 10:10:53 AM] <KBTibbs> Dark Empire... I have a collected edition. It's good, but not the best.
[05/24/18, 10:10:55 AM] <misssunflower94> @AromiaFlyce was that the one you told me to start with?
[05/24/18, 10:11:00 AM] <stargazer1977> @MeggieMay328 very nice, I have many of those tales as well. Book stories are my favorite stories. :)
[05/24/18, 10:11:06 AM] <WDM1262> @misssunflower94 are you feeling better btw?

[05/24/18, 10:11:15 AM] <MeggieMay328> Giant Size - think that was the actual term for those big comics i think
[05/24/18, 10:11:19 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: where would you recommend someone starts with if you only know the movies?
[05/24/18, 10:11:19 AM] <KingSundew> It introduced one of my favorite capital ships in Star Wars... The Eclipse Super Star Destroyer
[05/24/18, 10:11:24 AM] <Vance1982> twins

[05/24/18, 10:11:41 AM] <RuzgofDI> The Twins showed up in the Timothy Zahn books. Anakin was in the comics
[05/24/18, 10:11:43 AM] <ryan_witalison> The Twins were in The Thrawn Trilogy
[05/24/18, 10:11:45 AM] <AromiaFlyce> @misssunflower94 no, these are comics I havent read actually. Seems I have the 'new; ones from the 90s
[05/24/18, 10:11:50 AM] <KingSundew> soo many cool Superwapons
[05/24/18, 10:11:50 AM] <Crusher00004> ah the good days of star wars
[05/24/18, 10:11:56 AM] <darkofnate> Dark Empire was kind of a let down, after the awesomeness of the Thrawn Trilogy.
[05/24/18, 10:11:56 AM] <CharacterStigma> BlessRNG The Forgotten Sacred Text
[05/24/18, 10:12:03 AM] <WDM1262> @misssunflower94 I’m glad to hear that! I love these nerds.
[05/24/18, 10:12:04 AM] <misssunflower94> Welcome to comics where canon is ever shifting!
[05/24/18, 10:12:06 AM] <vexelghost> I still want to build a Star Wars Lego ship but they so costly.
[05/24/18, 10:12:06 AM] <stargazer1977> Thrawn was my first experience with the extended universe.
[05/24/18, 10:12:10 AM] <phoenixgoth> I still want a thrawn trilogy tv series
[05/24/18, 10:12:10 AM] <pactmagic> the twins and anakin existed in the same continuity, just starred mostly in different series
[05/24/18, 10:12:12 AM] <japenrose> @darkofnate The newer Thrawn?
[05/24/18, 10:12:14 AM] <ryan_witalison> Anakin was born during the Dark Empire series
[05/24/18, 10:12:17 AM] <CrashTestGremlin> I miss the eu
[05/24/18, 10:12:17 AM] <101deadpool1017> And the Ewok kid specials
[05/24/18, 10:12:17 AM] <aleph_sharp> hi!
[05/24/18, 10:12:19 AM] <Nate_BB> First sw comics combo was Shadows of the Empire and Rogue Squadron
[05/24/18, 10:12:20 AM] <thelesserbard> I just picked up a reissue of Tag & Bink Were Here at the comic book store, today. Am I alone in thinking Tag & Bink need their own movie?
[05/24/18, 10:12:28 AM] <Mamamota123> hi
[05/24/18, 10:12:28 AM] <Vance1982> Thrawn was one of my favorite villains but Rebels ruined him
