[05/25/18, 7:07:04 AM] <Alexanderhero83> the first Hobbit movie was okay second one's pretty good I love smog the third one is an Abomination and should be destroyed
[05/25/18, 7:07:07 AM] <shidareAKI> We had orcs the whole time but no Aragorn
[05/25/18, 7:07:08 AM] <Marb_04> the animated one is great
[05/25/18, 7:07:08 AM] <JustinPSluder> @Leigh574 I've had a copy of LotR since before the movies, I just read other things...mostly RPG books...
[05/25/18, 7:07:19 AM] <Lh_sabre> Nobody really needed the new Hobbit movies...except movie producers
[05/25/18, 7:07:27 AM] <XerKoro_neo> I loved the Hobbit Movies, fight me
[05/25/18, 7:07:31 AM] <steelneko> Lindsey Ellis has a great 3-part series on YouTube about the behind the scenes reasons *why* this movies ended up so iffy.
[05/25/18, 7:07:40 AM] <Marb_04> Beren and Luthien is an epic tale
[05/25/18, 7:07:41 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Lh_sabre Northern hemisphere will be having schools out in parts which will shift the internet workloads...
[05/25/18, 7:07:59 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @xerkoro_neo I punch you and hurt my hand.
[05/25/18, 7:08:27 AM] <Marb_04> Luthien was also half divine being
[05/25/18, 7:08:35 AM] <XerKoro_neo> 'Cause my feelings are too strong! jk
[05/25/18, 7:09:04 AM] <Bruchiosaurus> elf incest is not okay
[05/25/18, 7:09:16 AM] <Marb_04> Aragorn is descended from Elronds brother

[05/25/18, 7:09:24 AM] <JeffM0307> !wtfisthis
[05/25/18, 7:09:24 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green and a guest spend 90 minutes going deeper into a fandom then you may have thought possible. From Magic: The Gathering to Street Fighter we’re examining the stories and worldbuilding that makes these properties so enchanting. The guests and subjects are as varied as can be but the one thing that brings them together is passion.

[05/25/18, 7:12:34 AM] <Taeshren> Gandalf v Balrog was just a 1v1
[05/25/18, 7:12:35 AM] <Lalayla> It's so funny to listen to this - I play Lord of the Rings Online , and have for 11 years (We're past Mordor now) and it's so interesting to hear this stuff and relate it to the game
[05/25/18, 7:12:40 AM] <AtraGamer> When you want to remember this but you know you have bad memory haha
