[05/26/18, 7:03:25 AM] <Lefty79> @shidareAKI Ohai! I totally agree, and would put some money in on that.
[05/26/18, 7:03:25 AM] <sunlitlake> you think YOU'VE got porblems
[05/26/18, 7:03:26 AM] <babykangaD> they should roadtrip!! and film it
[05/26/18, 7:03:31 AM] <darkofnate> So should I assume we'll be starting a Kickstarter to send Gina to GenCon?
[05/26/18, 7:03:48 AM] <starpilotsix> Tell Gina to do streams and add a tip jar. ;)
[05/26/18, 7:03:48 AM] <shidareAKI> @babykangad that would be fun!
[05/26/18, 7:03:48 AM] <bumpkin312> nice @Pustulant
[05/26/18, 7:03:56 AM] <vykandys> I live in Indiana and have never been to Gencon. I suck lol
[05/26/18, 7:04:01 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I mean....Hawaii is kinda....ya know....on fire.
[05/26/18, 7:04:05 AM] <darthangelus2141> @HawkeyeNFO wait do you mean the water is at a pressure of 1 atmosphere?
[05/26/18, 7:04:05 AM] <starpilotsix> (Maybe I just want more Gina streams)
[05/26/18, 7:04:07 AM] <darkofnate> That would be AWESOME
[05/26/18, 7:04:08 AM] <chaoticloony> @babykangaD That would be cool!
[05/26/18, 7:04:08 AM] <davidflegel> Gina does have a Twitch channel. You can help her get to Gencon by sending her financial gifts. Just sayin'
[05/26/18, 7:04:20 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Like methane deposits are burning through the ground....kinda scary.
[05/26/18, 7:04:26 AM] <fallout4critter> only a very small part of Hawaii is on fire
[05/26/18, 7:04:27 AM] <Lefty79> Or if Amy had Gina as a guest on her stream to help raise money...
[05/26/18, 7:04:46 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> XD
[05/26/18, 7:04:48 AM] <KBTibbs> Sam never announces

[05/26/18, 7:05:22 AM] <jherchin12345> wow they werent kidding when they said anouncements were short today
[05/26/18, 7:05:25 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> On earth, because gravitational acceleration is about 9.8 m/s^2, the pressure under water increases at about 1 atmosphere per 10 meters of water depth

[05/26/18, 7:07:16 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> @angelus2141 I mean if it was like on the movie "The Abyss" where there is a room with some air in it at about 1 atmosphere, and some water, and a forcefield is separating the air and water
[05/26/18, 7:07:20 AM] <MdrnDayMercutio> *shouts

[05/26/18, 7:08:43 AM] ** strous1 is going fullscreen.
[05/26/18, 7:08:49 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> If say you were wearing a hard shelled diving suit and tried to walk through the forcefield into the water, would the water pressure just push you back into the side with the air?
[05/26/18, 7:09:20 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @HawkeyeNFO Sounds like a question for Because Science.

[05/26/18, 7:09:55 AM] <HawkeyeNFO> I was thinking about that because something like that might happen in this episode
[05/26/18, 7:09:58 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Hello @Alexanderhero83
[05/26/18, 7:10:14 AM] <darthangelus2141> @HawkeyeNFO ohhhh like a moon pool. no the pressure of the water wouldnt move you back but it would be difficult to move into depending on the depth and by connection the pressure of the water because with enough force you would move the water out of the way. the only way it could move you back would be if there was an underwater current moving against you
