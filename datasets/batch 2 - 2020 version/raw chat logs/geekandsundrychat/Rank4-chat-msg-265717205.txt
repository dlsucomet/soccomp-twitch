[05/26/18, 12:07:18 PM] <FallzVentus> I am very much a punk aesthetic when I try, but i always thought goth was very cool.
[05/26/18, 12:07:22 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I was normie friend of goths
[05/26/18, 12:07:26 PM] <cy0nknight> The best kind of goth imo!

[05/26/18, 12:07:36 PM] <GreyAngel> I love all those looks
[05/26/18, 12:07:36 PM] <cinphoria> oh NO not the tubes
[05/26/18, 12:07:38 PM] <shidareAKI> I never quite made it to goth as a teen
[05/26/18, 12:07:39 PM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> I was the only prep the high school goths liked.
[05/26/18, 12:07:45 PM] <shidareAKI> I was a flannel goth?
[05/26/18, 12:07:45 PM] <misssunflower94> I’m so glad chat is full of beautiful goths
[05/26/18, 12:07:48 PM] <Bobyn28> Her eye makeup is killing me, burying me, and then bringing me back to life.
[05/26/18, 12:07:50 PM] <asgcreations> Ohhh god the dreadfalls
[05/26/18, 12:07:50 PM] <Durellreid1> hi room
[05/26/18, 12:07:50 PM] <sarenite> anxiety goth is the sub sub sub culture that fuels all goth variants
[05/26/18, 12:07:53 PM] <StraightErro> @Alexanderhero83 Delilah, yes, VM killed her a number of times, but the last one was before she could prep a contingency, Mercer even said flatly she is no more
[05/26/18, 12:07:54 PM] <misssunflower94> I was surrounded by goth teens
[05/26/18, 12:08:01 PM] <Makriev> We're ready for clubbers to be back with cyberpunk/cybergoth
[05/26/18, 12:08:04 PM] <Medinaquirin> goth is worryingly expensive to pull off.
[05/26/18, 12:08:04 PM] <shidareAKI> Is flannel goth a think?
[05/26/18, 12:08:05 PM] <shidareAKI> thing

[05/26/18, 12:08:14 PM] <cinphoria> are you kidding
[05/26/18, 12:08:14 PM] <misssunflower94> I’ve always been around goths before I embraced

[05/26/18, 12:08:26 PM] <CrazedBotanyGeek> I wanted to be a goth in high school, ended up being punk.
[05/26/18, 12:08:28 PM] <theladytiefling> i wanted dread falls so much as a small blizz, so i just grew dreadlocks XD
[05/26/18, 12:08:31 PM] <cinphoria> @shidareAKI the height of goth kind of coincided with the height of grunge, so
[05/26/18, 12:08:31 PM] <Mainnalle> I used to be undercover goth.
[05/26/18, 12:08:32 PM] <83osirous> What would nerdy goth look like?

[05/26/18, 12:09:29 PM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> The high school goths in particular had a area called The Shadow Land, bc, as you do, the sun didn't shine in the room.

[05/26/18, 12:10:13 PM] <halfaringcircus> I wanted black hair with lime green streaks in high school. Then I went to college and there was only one person with dyed hair at that school. She was awesome, but people acted like that was her only notable characteristic. Now I work retail. *Grumble*
