[05/30/18, 7:07:20 AM] <super390> She was the canary.
[05/30/18, 7:07:22 AM] <The_TBoyce> Androids: they're taking our jobs!
[05/30/18, 7:07:27 AM] <Sylien_> for now
[05/30/18, 7:07:43 AM] <The_TBoyce> But seriously: androids are basically a sci-fi allegory for immigrants.
[05/30/18, 7:07:53 AM] <baxorn> Google is selling AI to the military. Soon we will all be batteries for robots.\

[05/30/18, 7:09:43 AM] <Andyinsomnia> my PS4 already took a trip to europe, which is handy as I live in europe
[05/30/18, 7:09:55 AM] <darkofnate> DON'T ANNOUNCE A NEW CONSOLE UNTIL WE CAN UPLOAD ALL OF OUR CURRENT GAMES
[05/30/18, 7:10:03 AM] <Triamas> they can't really update it to ps5 yet as the console would cost too much if it would have any noticeable upgrades
[05/30/18, 7:10:11 AM] <darkofnate> AND ALSO CHANGE OUR PSN NAMES...
[05/30/18, 7:10:32 AM] <EricaTheStrange> exactly @darkofnate

[05/30/18, 7:13:00 AM] <sunlitlake> Women had to learn how to fly even MORE planes than the men did, in just as dangerous zone, becauase they were taking them to and from the other pilots
[05/30/18, 7:13:00 AM] <dalgeras> Anyone got a shovel
[05/30/18, 7:13:03 AM] <steelneko> LOL
[05/30/18, 7:13:20 AM] <Zer0_Dawn_> I don't buy into the realism bit, but the trailer to me felt like it hadn't decided on a time period yet.
[05/30/18, 7:13:20 AM] <Sylien_> I LOVE ALL OF YOU
[05/30/18, 7:13:26 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Is he going to get smacked with a rifle butt? XD

[05/30/18, 7:14:20 AM] <super390> In total warfare the dividing line between combat and noncombat military service collapses. Everyone gets bombed.
[05/30/18, 7:14:20 AM] <sunlitlake> also loads of Women served in WW1 becauase they were so desperate for people they just stopped bothering with checking who was signing up.
