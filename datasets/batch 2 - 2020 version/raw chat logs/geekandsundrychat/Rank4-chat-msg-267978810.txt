[06/1/18, 7:05:21 AM] <Ossborn> I kind of dig Nightcrawler... same nationality :-D
[06/1/18, 7:05:22 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Spider-Man had a manga in the '70s. And it was like super dark and violent.
[06/1/18, 7:05:25 AM] <RMutt1917> of course Hector brought a stack of Marvel encyclopedias LUL
[06/1/18, 7:05:54 AM] <Sarazzard> I never got into super heroes in general... I don't know why. We gobbled up spider-man cartoons when we were kids, same as everywhere else, but I never got the urge to go pick up a comic book.
[06/1/18, 7:06:19 AM] <InventoryFullPT> Very yes to Italian Spidermab
[06/1/18, 7:06:24 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Oh, I still love the 90's Spiderman series.
[06/1/18, 7:06:29 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> I remember the episode that had Morbius, Punisher and Blade. It was sick.
[06/1/18, 7:06:52 AM] <EricaTheStrange> it had a great theme tune @John_Sparks_Jr
[06/1/18, 7:06:58 AM] <SIRPhist> Kurt Wagner is a strong character
[06/1/18, 7:07:03 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> LUL I did that too!!
[06/1/18, 7:07:03 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Hector, I had the same thing.
[06/1/18, 7:07:08 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @EricaTheStrange YES. SO MUCH YES. XD
[06/1/18, 7:07:18 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> Hector, you rock buddy. :)
[06/1/18, 7:07:50 AM] <Sarazzard> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman Yeah, I remember that part ~ And the "secret wars" arc, when they brought everyone else into the series for this huge mashup.
[06/1/18, 7:07:52 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah, crossover is a big detail I love. @GeekandSundry
[06/1/18, 7:07:54 AM] <chaoticloony> I grew up on Superfriends and the Batman tv show
[06/1/18, 7:07:54 AM] <Zismarith> How is flying while on fire not a sport? It's totally a sport, dad.
[06/1/18, 7:08:13 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> One of my favorites was the Justice League showing up on Static Shock. Hilarious.
[06/1/18, 7:08:18 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> @Sarazzard The Spider-Man cartoon is why I'm a Madame Web fan.
[06/1/18, 7:08:37 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> hahaha @John_Sparks_Jr
[06/1/18, 7:08:40 AM] <Quizzical_Haddock> lol He was only one man!
[06/1/18, 7:08:41 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Ohhh, I forgot about Madam Web @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman
[06/1/18, 7:08:51 AM] <Ossborn> I recently wanted to watch the Avengers animated tv show on netflix.... but they translated the theme song into german and it wasd sung so bad that I cringed and gandsNopeNopeNope the EFF out of there after 3 episodes
[06/1/18, 7:08:55 AM] <tabletoptales> awe sweet Hector Ryan and Comics
[06/1/18, 7:09:19 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman Though, I have to say, I kind of disagree on your username. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Superman is better either, but... they're both good guys. XD
[06/1/18, 7:09:25 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> Really? That's funky.. :/ @Ossborn
[06/1/18, 7:09:34 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> It's still hard to wrap my head around Loki being popular with people who aren't super into comics. I remember when NOBODY cared.
[06/1/18, 7:09:37 AM] <SIRPhist> Francisco Scaramanga
[06/1/18, 7:09:47 AM] <SIRPhist> he's not Marvel
[06/1/18, 7:09:48 AM] <Sarazzard> In Portugal, she was called "mulher aranha". Spider woman, literally. Let it never be said that all our dubs were creative.
[06/1/18, 7:10:11 AM] <SIRPhist> Rest In Peace, Mr. Lee
[06/1/18, 7:10:17 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman I really am not a fan of Loki. Folks love him.. I don't get it either. haha
[06/1/18, 7:11:02 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> And now, I haven't seen Infinity War, but I'm seeing people talking about Thanos now. That's insane to me.
[06/1/18, 7:11:05 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Really? I love Hiddleston's Loki.
[06/1/18, 7:11:09 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Great character.
[06/1/18, 7:11:25 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman You really should check it out.
[06/1/18, 7:11:32 AM] <Sarazzard> That was all Tom Hiddleston's doing, I think. He really sold the character, you rarely see a guy having that much fun with his part.
[06/1/18, 7:11:42 AM] <CherryGryffon> TBH Some of us just get really drawn to villains. Growing up, I was into Disney like all the other girls. But I was into the Villains, not the princesses.
[06/1/18, 7:11:42 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @John_Sparks_Jr I like HIddleston more than I like Loki.
[06/1/18, 7:11:50 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> If Marvel ever makes an Alpha Flight movie, people will start talking about Sasquatch and Puck.
[06/1/18, 7:12:02 AM] <SIRPhist> Wade Wilson and Thanos both love Death. Death digs Wade. Thanos is a dork
[06/1/18, 7:12:08 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> That's cool. @CherryGryffon
[06/1/18, 7:12:11 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @SuperGimpoMan I'm... really not sure I understand that statement. It sounds like "I love blue, but I hate blue" to me.
[06/1/18, 7:12:14 AM] <lizardbreath27> I just tuned in...Ryan's tie game is on point today
[06/1/18, 7:12:17 AM] <tabletoptales> South Park Cartman business plan for MCU
[06/1/18, 7:12:19 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> @SuperGimpoMan As soon as it comes out to TV I will. Not really able to get out to a theater, sadly.
[06/1/18, 7:12:43 AM] <chaoticloony> My problem with comics is that they are too expensive for the amount of reading involved
[06/1/18, 7:13:02 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @John_Sparks_Jr Other people love him and I don't understand why, is what I meant.
[06/1/18, 7:13:09 AM] <SIRPhist> "Catwoman"
[06/1/18, 7:13:11 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Yeah, they are that, @chaoticloony
[06/1/18, 7:13:15 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman Aw, bummer. Okie doke!
[06/1/18, 7:13:25 AM] <SIRPhist> remember Catwoman?

[06/1/18, 7:13:32 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @SuperGimpoMan He's a well written, well built character. It's pretty simple.
[06/1/18, 7:13:32 AM] <chaoticloony> I loved the Marvel and DC Handbooks, but otherwise only bought a few comics

[06/1/18, 7:14:16 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> @Ossborn I'll give it a shot. xD
[06/1/18, 7:14:58 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman Doom probably is one of the characters I want to explore most.

[06/1/18, 7:16:23 AM] <Sarazzard> I only bought a handful of comics in my life, but none of them were super-hero themed. There was Tomb Raider one, then a couple from a series called "Sillage" and another that I don't remember but that took place in hell... mostly.
[06/1/18, 7:16:36 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Thank you.
[06/1/18, 7:16:41 AM] <Leigh574> You're Welcome

[06/1/18, 7:17:49 AM] <Ossborn> I once won a Tomb Raider comic from G&S.... it was from the 14 hour Fallout 4 stream and Amy brought it from her comic book store for a raffle
