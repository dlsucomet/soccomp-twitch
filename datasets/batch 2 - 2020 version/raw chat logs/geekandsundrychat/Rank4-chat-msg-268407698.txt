[06/2/18, 7:06:24 AM] <VermillionCrimson> You could kill someone with Laura's bag o' dice.
[06/2/18, 7:06:27 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @angelus2141 only thing that comes up is food allergies, of which the peanut variety can be pretty nasty for some people
[06/2/18, 7:06:32 AM] <chaoticloony> There is no such thing as TOO MANY DICE!!!!!!
[06/2/18, 7:06:37 AM] <RJLadyA> what dice brand comes in a tube?
[06/2/18, 7:06:45 AM] <rtk142> is Sam playing Tome of Foes?

[06/2/18, 7:07:08 AM] <fallout4critter> you mean tomb of foes :'D
[06/2/18, 7:07:11 AM] <That_One_Guy212> and i have to say aliza looks great with her hair in the mirror verse episode
[06/2/18, 7:07:28 AM] <RJLadyA> @angelus2141 mine cost 10 for generic epi
[06/2/18, 7:07:50 AM] <rtk142> @That_One_Guy212 And Sam's look was totally on point in the Mirror universe
[06/2/18, 7:07:57 AM] <darthangelus2141> @RJLadyA $10 for one epi pen?!!!
[06/2/18, 7:07:59 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @angelus2141 I have no idea, but my food allergies so far do not necesitate them
[06/2/18, 7:07:59 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Are any member of shield of Tomorrow going to be on stream of many eyes.

[06/2/18, 7:10:14 AM] <rtk142> I don't think it's ever been addressed @That_One_Guy212
[06/2/18, 7:10:15 AM] <newblets1983> poster
[06/2/18, 7:10:20 AM] <newMoonlight> I was hoping it would be read
[06/2/18, 7:10:24 AM] <darthangelus2141> every starfleet officer gets a copy of the manual after graduation. Good officers read it cover to cover.... great officers recycle it immediately
[06/2/18, 7:10:25 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> It's a Jeffrie!
[06/2/18, 7:10:35 AM] <Alexanderhero83> I want Eric Campbell to Dm a Long campaign in DND 5th edition.
[06/2/18, 7:10:42 AM] <rtk142> funny @angelus2141
[06/2/18, 7:10:50 AM] <gogt200> @That_One_Guy212 First name is the hosts first name, last name is the symbiotes name.
[06/2/18, 7:10:57 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @rtk142 well that sucks that wwould be cool to just know and build the trll society
[06/2/18, 7:11:20 AM] <Fu4ow> <3 George
[06/2/18, 7:11:22 AM] <SCOTCHBOXVR> <3 <3 <3
[06/2/18, 7:11:26 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @gogt200 i mean the host is obvious but symbiotes names are a mystery i want to know
[06/2/18, 7:11:38 AM] <Fu4ow> hear that the accusation against George is most likely false?
[06/2/18, 7:11:49 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> awww adorbs
[06/2/18, 7:11:59 AM] <misroi> GOWRON-SEMPAI NOTICED ME
[06/2/18, 7:12:00 AM] <EricaTheStrange> We need Eric to lose his sh*t on stream one time, someone get Robert O'Rilely to guest star :D
[06/2/18, 7:12:05 AM] <LibrarianLizz> was dropped
[06/2/18, 7:12:06 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> I love Eric's joyful enthusiasm for his whole geekdom.
[06/2/18, 7:12:18 AM] <newMoonlight> is there anyone there reading the chat?
[06/2/18, 7:12:24 AM] <KaiOrAya> @fu4ow I'm rather happy to hear the news
[06/2/18, 7:12:25 AM] <chaoticloony> I heard nothing!
[06/2/18, 7:12:27 AM] <Slippydude> yeah, thats not really on Eric...
[06/2/18, 7:12:30 AM] <cinphoria> @Betsyj77 just mods and crew
[06/2/18, 7:12:31 AM] <GuloWolver> @fu4ow Not from what I've heard, basically it's complicated...
[06/2/18, 7:12:31 AM] <That_One_Guy212> gowron was great in ds9
[06/2/18, 7:12:32 AM] <rtk142> *nods* I've seen DS9 many times, but to my knowledge it was never covered. None of hte other series really dealt with Trill much
[06/2/18, 7:12:34 AM] <aleph_sharp> What? I saw nothing
[06/2/18, 7:12:35 AM] <TeldrassilBBQ> Hope this sub still works
[06/2/18, 7:12:36 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Thomas (don't mention my last name) ...
[06/2/18, 7:12:50 AM] <gogt200> That is so cool!
[06/2/18, 7:12:51 AM] <Fu4ow> @GuloWolver yeah that's a better way to put it. My bad
[06/2/18, 7:12:56 AM] <OceanicPicon815> im so happy for Eric. <3
[06/2/18, 7:12:59 AM] <darthangelus2141> @That_One_Guy212 i thinka reasonable explanation would be the symbiont is given a name based on the first host. So till they are joined they have no name. then they take on the first or last name of the first host that way the first host needs no name change
[06/2/18, 7:13:04 AM] <newblets1983> very nice poster
[06/2/18, 7:13:05 AM] <rtk142> 1
