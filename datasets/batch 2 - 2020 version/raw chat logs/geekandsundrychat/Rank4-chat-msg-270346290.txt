[06/7/18, 10:08:02 AM] <misssunflower94> I want to comixology but I just love print so much
[06/7/18, 10:08:09 AM] <feathersflight> I did not know that you could use Amazon Prime for comixology free stuff!

[06/7/18, 10:08:16 AM] <misssunflower94> someday I'll have a tablet and read online

[06/7/18, 10:08:36 AM] <RMutt1917> @skuNk_citY DJWheat announced it last week, also no tux :/
[06/7/18, 10:08:36 AM] <stargazer1977> @misssunflower94 I very much prefer print, but I use e-books and e-comic books when I travel. :)
[06/7/18, 10:08:37 AM] <emilydawn96> Oh shiiit tal shaved again!!! What a look!!
[06/7/18, 10:08:41 AM] <phoenixgoth> Of *course* you were, Taliesin
[06/7/18, 10:08:43 AM] <halfaringcircus> Ooooh. This is pertinent to my interests! That comic I'm working on will hopefully want a home away from my couch one day.
[06/7/18, 10:09:11 AM] <pagyun> ok that sounds fucking fantastic
[06/7/18, 10:09:12 AM] <BijutsuYoukai> You had me at 'Mash-up animal kaiju'.

[06/7/18, 10:09:41 AM] <MervynPumpkinHead> wise words
[06/7/18, 10:09:50 AM] <KBTibbs> Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?
[06/7/18, 10:09:53 AM] <MervynPumpkinHead> similar to carl sagan
[06/7/18, 10:09:56 AM] <JeffM0307> Erika is saying science is like the three bears. :P
[06/7/18, 10:09:57 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @GreyAngel what both Amy and Erika may "lack" in size they more than make up in personality, knowledge, and pure energy/enthusiasm
[06/7/18, 10:10:03 AM] <starpilotsix> The sad truth is most mad scientists are really more mad engineers.
[06/7/18, 10:10:03 AM] <misssunflower94> NAMES!
[06/7/18, 10:10:05 AM] <KBTibbs> Oh hey der everyone.
[06/7/18, 10:10:10 AM] <RMutt1917> @stargazer1977 it was announced just last week
[06/7/18, 10:10:13 AM] <misssunflower94> that's

[06/7/18, 10:10:21 AM] <stargazer1977> I personally... am an irked scientist myself. Mostly because of how many science denying people are running around free of medication and psychological help.
[06/7/18, 10:10:21 AM] <brassmama> SAM HUMPHRIES? SPIKE? MAGS? Okay, so.... I'm sold
[06/7/18, 10:10:21 AM] <KBTibbs> Sam "The Hammer" Humphries!

[06/7/18, 10:10:25 AM] <ArtemisRuse> I didn't know amy could rap
[06/7/18, 10:10:26 AM] <owifig> Because a scientist who went just far enough is Bill Nye
[06/7/18, 10:10:28 AM] <RMutt1917> Holding out for the Seeley and Humphries titles.
[06/7/18, 10:10:30 AM] <halfaringcircus> Tim Seeley does good comics!

[06/7/18, 10:11:02 AM] <Alexanderhero83> how much is an Amazon Prime account?
[06/7/18, 10:11:03 AM] <GreyAngel> @misssunflower94 did you expect any less?
[06/7/18, 10:11:10 AM] <Fembot_ArtsyPantS> Welcome to the big time!
[06/7/18, 10:11:11 AM] <duke_elligos> what was the name of the comic?
[06/7/18, 10:11:14 AM] <DoctorJangel> have they read fan mail yet?
[06/7/18, 10:11:17 AM] <brassmama> Okay, so the Spike inclusion has me by the short and curlies.

[06/7/18, 10:11:31 AM] <jessieleaf> @DoctorJangel No fan mail this week
[06/7/18, 10:11:36 AM] <feathersflight> I don't think they do the Daily Wednesday when one of them isn't there
[06/7/18, 10:11:43 AM] <aleph_sharp> Its only a matter of time until theres an animated Xmen-like animated ad with Sam Reigel singing
[06/7/18, 10:11:44 AM] <DJPheonyx> @Alexanderhero83 About $100 USD, but that also includes Amazon Video and one free Twitch channel sub

[06/7/18, 10:12:21 AM] <halfaringcircus> Revival is one of very, very few things that gets what small Midwest towns are like, imho.
[06/7/18, 10:12:21 AM] <darkhalfelf284> Is it just me or are there tentacles on Erika's leggings? They look SO COOL Erika! TwitchUnity

[06/7/18, 10:12:43 AM] <AstralUnicorn> cinphoria :D
[06/7/18, 10:12:53 AM] <Vance1982> Moore hates movie adaptions
[06/7/18, 10:12:55 AM] <stargazer1977> I can't even imagine what Promethea adapted to the screen would be. I don't think there is any way I could like it.
[06/7/18, 10:13:03 AM] <NeverwinterFool> Most Moore adaptations have been terrible.
[06/7/18, 10:13:10 AM] <shesoffonatangent> hello lovely chat
[06/7/18, 10:13:13 AM] <halfaringcircus> However, his novels shouldn't really be novels. There's a script worth of description there. Lot's of description.
[06/7/18, 10:13:15 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I was gonna crank up my volume but Erika (experiance based knowledge)
[06/7/18, 10:13:19 AM] <vexelghost> Is this a rerun or did Tal get a haircut?
[06/7/18, 10:13:22 AM] <artistsomeday> Tell us your feelings
[06/7/18, 10:13:24 AM] <herladykrow> I was going to edit tonight. But then Erica, Amy and Taliesin decided to talk about Moore.
[06/7/18, 10:13:24 AM] <shesoffonatangent> I'm here early this week <3
[06/7/18, 10:13:24 AM] <KaiOrAya> @aleph_sharp I don't think it's a through kind of thing. I have Prime and had to pay for Comixology Unlimited. I think they meant you can get to the comics via either
[06/7/18, 10:13:29 AM] <SerAntistud> *Hears Watchman* *Looks at the Watchman book 2 feet from me*
[06/7/18, 10:13:30 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: If Alan Moore adapted something today what would you like to see him take up
[06/7/18, 10:13:33 AM] <101deadpool1017> I think the Watchman movie, fixed the ending
[06/7/18, 10:13:36 AM] <JeffM0307> @vexelghost We're live, so Tal got a haircut
[06/7/18, 10:13:37 AM] <Ebonitacocat> @vexelghost haircut
[06/7/18, 10:13:38 AM] <aleph_sharp> @kaioraya ok, good to know
[06/7/18, 10:13:41 AM] <brassmama> @vexelghost Haircut
[06/7/18, 10:13:42 AM] <Muntface> seminal? gandsHR
[06/7/18, 10:13:43 AM] <derixyleth> @vexelghost Tal brought the hawk back
[06/7/18, 10:13:52 AM] <ArtemisRuse> league of extraordinary gentleman is an amazing movie and none of you can chnge my mind
[06/7/18, 10:13:57 AM] <giljaxon> in 2001 or so we made a dr manhattan 12" figure using a goldberg wrestling doll
[06/7/18, 10:13:58 AM] <CheGuava> How many Moore adaptations have there been? I can only think of Watchmen and Swamp Thing right now
[06/7/18, 10:14:02 AM] <CLJedi> TOPIC: Farenheit 451 style, all comic books are about to be burned. What comic series do you choose to embody to later recreate and rebuild society with? do you choose personal favorite or culturally significant/impactful.?
[06/7/18, 10:14:08 AM] <cinphoria> *snortlaughs* bless.
[06/7/18, 10:14:10 AM] <vexelghost> He looks great with that look. gandsTWC
[06/7/18, 10:14:10 AM] <giljaxon> also made a kembra pfahler out of a dollar store barbie
[06/7/18, 10:14:14 AM] <phoenixgoth> I love you so much, Tal, did I mention this
