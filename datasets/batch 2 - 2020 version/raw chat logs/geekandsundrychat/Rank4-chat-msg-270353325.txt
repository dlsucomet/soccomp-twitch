[06/7/18, 12:35:19 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> <3
[06/7/18, 12:35:57 PM] <lakwar> oh I was wondering if they were going to paint their nails during the game. Using them as reminders is a great idea.
[06/7/18, 12:36:15 PM] <FlamingSimian> *can almost hear the last second panic setup going on behind the scenes*
[06/7/18, 12:36:18 PM] <DJPheonyx> That is actually a cool idea... and this is one of Markeia's first times GMing?
[06/7/18, 12:36:20 PM] <super390> @tatzelthess Gina used to actually work as an Official Disney Princess at birthday parties.
[06/7/18, 12:36:24 PM] <kynaeus2> why would they be painting their nails
[06/7/18, 12:36:37 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> Ariel?
[06/7/18, 12:36:48 PM] <DJPheonyx> That idea is something veteran GMs wouldn't think of to keep track of that
[06/7/18, 12:37:00 PM] <tatzelthess> oh yeah! forgot the princess thing
[06/7/18, 12:37:10 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> nail painting by chal;lenge type
[06/7/18, 12:37:15 PM] <glshade1> Thing are better no that weave society is on was a bit of a rough day @blacklionofthestars how you

[06/7/18, 12:37:36 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> :D
[06/7/18, 12:37:39 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> heh jeff
[06/7/18, 12:37:41 PM] <FlamingSimian> because nail painting is oddly cathartic?
[06/7/18, 12:37:52 PM] <kynaeus2> @glshade1 ramaLove ramaLove
[06/7/18, 12:37:55 PM] <glshade1> Erika picked that patter right up...cool good to have continuity
