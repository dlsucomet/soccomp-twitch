[06/14/18, 10:06:37 AM] <halfaringcircus> Way to find something you're not qualified for, Taliesin, Handmodel Jaffe.

[06/14/18, 10:06:45 AM] <halfaringcircus> Are they super freaky?

[06/14/18, 10:06:49 AM] <phoenixgoth> I'm a little late, but hello everybody
[06/14/18, 10:06:51 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @phoenixgoth
[06/14/18, 10:06:53 AM] <AromiaFlyce> @VermillionCrimson ty! Nightwing!
[06/14/18, 10:06:55 AM] <misssunflower94> I'd trust Dick Grayson
[06/14/18, 10:06:57 AM] <UncleOok> Nightwing is the most trusted hero in the DC Universe
[06/14/18, 10:07:04 AM] <KaiOrAya> Comixology and Marvel Unlimited are totally worth it. MU is especially great if you're reading older stuff. At a few issues read a month you've saved money
[06/14/18, 10:07:10 AM] <mathemagician_> hi @phoenixgoth
[06/14/18, 10:07:10 AM] <darkofnate> Hold on...there are people who trust Batman!?

[06/14/18, 10:07:46 AM] <phoenixgoth> I don't recognize our guest, but I'm excited!
[06/14/18, 10:07:57 AM] <giljaxon> ive been holding out for those massive hardcover annotated sandman editions
[06/14/18, 10:07:59 AM] <UmbraCorvus27> I would definitely trust Nightwing
[06/14/18, 10:08:03 AM] <GreyAngel> is that a bone key?
[06/14/18, 10:08:07 AM] <KaiOrAya> @iceilluser It was just announced. I'm super excited
[06/14/18, 10:08:08 AM] <ToonEzon> what? wow
[06/14/18, 10:08:09 AM] <stargazer1977> Joker is probably the only one who I would trust in the DC Universe. I always know what he's going to do so I can expect it.
[06/14/18, 10:08:10 AM] <misssunflower94> show us your trailers Taliesin!
[06/14/18, 10:08:11 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> the annotated versions are AMAZING.

[06/14/18, 10:08:19 AM] <AromiaFlyce> OG BOOOK
[06/14/18, 10:08:20 AM] <Smarcey> Oh this is Matt’s first time seeing the sick graphic
[06/14/18, 10:08:29 AM] <iceilluser> @kaioraya very excited!
[06/14/18, 10:08:31 AM] <LilyRose28> Show of hands, who wound up with a weird crush on Death?
[06/14/18, 10:08:31 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I kinda miss Motion Comics. I really enjoyed the Watchmen one.
[06/14/18, 10:08:34 AM] ** AromiaFlyce drools over the giant book
[06/14/18, 10:08:47 AM] <cinphoria> @LilyRose28 there's nothing weird about having a crush on Death :P
[06/14/18, 10:08:53 AM] <darkofnate> My library has a copy of that giant Sandman compendium.
[06/14/18, 10:08:54 AM] <seratonia> The Segue Club
[06/14/18, 10:08:56 AM] <UncleOok> Segue Man & Segue Woman are on the job tonight
[06/14/18, 10:08:57 AM] <LilyRose28> ..true
[06/14/18, 10:09:01 AM] <Impossiblegirl11> Going full screen cause I am watching with my BF who is watching the show for the first time!
[06/14/18, 10:09:05 AM] <giljaxon> THATS THE EDITION I NEED
[06/14/18, 10:09:13 AM] <stargazer1977> @LilyRose28 I had a crush on Death, but I never considered it weird. You are supposed to have a dangerous crush on Death, if not, you are not writing Death correctly.
[06/14/18, 10:09:18 AM] <BijutsuYoukai> That is a thicc book. Dang.

[06/14/18, 10:09:26 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: How would one differentiate Comic Book from Graphic Novel? or is it just a tomato to-mah-to?
[06/14/18, 10:09:26 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> Oh gawd look at that art
[06/14/18, 10:09:30 AM] <cy0nknight> God, that's an amazing copy.
[06/14/18, 10:09:31 AM] <iceilluser> so pretty but so hard to actually carry around and read....
[06/14/18, 10:09:31 AM] <stargazer1977> I have all 4 volumes of the Absolute editions. They are great.
[06/14/18, 10:09:33 AM] <mithrix> sweeeet...
[06/14/18, 10:09:33 AM] <misssunflower94> Peel the comic onion for us
[06/14/18, 10:09:34 AM] <KBTibbs> I own that edition, but the binding is falling apart. I'm so sad
[06/14/18, 10:09:34 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Hardcover collections are my jam.
[06/14/18, 10:09:35 AM] <KaiOrAya> That is a thing I've wanted since it was announced
[06/14/18, 10:09:36 AM] <Countxaero> Such a damn good series too
[06/14/18, 10:09:37 AM] <GreyAngel> book strip tease

[06/14/18, 10:09:41 AM] <mathemagician_> I have that, it's falling to pieces cos it's a canceled library one
[06/14/18, 10:09:42 AM] <Impossiblegirl11> @misssunflower94 that is a good question
[06/14/18, 10:09:46 AM] <misssunflower94> @DJPheonyx oh no u ok?

[06/14/18, 10:09:51 AM] <LilyRose28> @stargazer1977 yeah I was in a BAD place when I read these so it always felt real heckin strange
[06/14/18, 10:09:53 AM] <Blackvial2000> That looks brand new
[06/14/18, 10:09:55 AM] <misssunflower94> oh god that is a sexy book
[06/14/18, 10:10:00 AM] <giljaxon> mckean illustrated john cale's autobiog, WHAT'S WELSH FOR ZEN, it is fantastic
[06/14/18, 10:10:04 AM] <raphofgreengables> ngl Sandown is my fav series

[06/14/18, 10:10:09 AM] <ToonEzon> VOLUME 1!!!??!!
[06/14/18, 10:10:13 AM] <darkofnate> @misssunflower94 Typically, I would say a comic is an ongoing series and a graphic novel is a one or two shot.
[06/14/18, 10:10:14 AM] ** AromiaFlyce takes notes
[06/14/18, 10:10:15 AM] <DiafthoraSidhe> I would kill for that book >.>
[06/14/18, 10:10:18 AM] <KBTibbs> Yep
[06/14/18, 10:10:21 AM] <Vance1982> https://www.amazon.com/Absolute-Sandman-Vol-1/dp/1401210821/ref=pd_sim_14_5?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1401210821&pd_rd_r=79MCXA9XV99NY19BG9M8&pd_rd_w=UWfWO&pd_rd_wg=uyf6E&psc=1&refRID=79MCXA9XV99NY19BG9M8
[06/14/18, 10:10:24 AM] <stargazer1977> @LilyRose28 hopefully you feel in a better place now. But embrace the attraction to Death, it's more healthy. ;)
[06/14/18, 10:10:26 AM] <Asrathiel2912> @misssunflower94 i was thinking exactly the same thing. that is a beautiful thing
[06/14/18, 10:10:31 AM] <vexelghost> I Saw that on sale on Indigo for under $200 CAD.
[06/14/18, 10:10:40 AM] <Impossiblegirl11> @misssunflower94 Graphic novel tells a story in one book while comic books tells the story in many issues.
[06/14/18, 10:10:42 AM] <LilyRose28> @stargazer1977 oh yeah I'm FINE now. She's cute.
[06/14/18, 10:10:43 AM] <AromiaFlyce> omfg that is a LOT of money
[06/14/18, 10:10:50 AM] <cinphoria> ...What was that, Taliesin? :P
[06/14/18, 10:10:51 AM] <Impossiblegirl11> @misssunflower94 Just looked it up.
[06/14/18, 10:10:51 AM] <geekmomma3> That's the one I got at my library book sale for $1! I felt like I was robbing them.
[06/14/18, 10:10:53 AM] <halfaringcircus> I'm working through Black Orchid right now. So strange watching McKean do whole issues instead of just covers.
[06/14/18, 10:10:56 AM] <Smarcey> You sell the trades to buy the hardcover
[06/14/18, 10:10:57 AM] <herladykrow> the sound of her wings is so good
[06/14/18, 10:11:04 AM] ** VermillionCrimson whistles
[06/14/18, 10:11:05 AM] <ToonEzon> how do your thighs not get sore and num from reading those tomes?
[06/14/18, 10:11:09 AM] <Smarcey> You give friends .cbr copies
[06/14/18, 10:11:17 AM] <iceilluser> @geekmomma3 library book sales are the best
[06/14/18, 10:11:29 AM] <loganlaws> SeemsGood
[06/14/18, 10:11:32 AM] <misssunflower94> @ToonEzon I bet it's like having a cat on your lap - yeah your legs fall asleep but it's worth it
[06/14/18, 10:11:34 AM] <mathemagician_> @ToonEzon they are actually really inconveniently sized
[06/14/18, 10:11:35 AM] <darkofnate> Mr. Miracle was in the first volume
[06/14/18, 10:11:42 AM] <cinphoria> also, some people are into that.
[06/14/18, 10:11:59 AM] <stargazer1977> Watchmen is technically not a Graphic Novel, it's a limited run comic. But at a certain point the definitions interfere rather than help. So call it a graphic novel if you want.
[06/14/18, 10:12:01 AM] <Vance1982> I just bought Vol 1 Absolute
[06/14/18, 10:12:08 AM] <geekmomma3> @iceilluser I'm a BIG believer in supporting local libraries.
[06/14/18, 10:12:19 AM] <crthemighty> i saw neil call pat rothfuss fancy on twitter and pat was like "be cool everyone"

[06/14/18, 10:12:49 AM] <RealMicah> I'm surprised Matt didn't catch on to that before.
[06/14/18, 10:12:49 AM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> We need you Matt, don't go!
[06/14/18, 10:12:55 AM] <stargazer1977> Amy <3
[06/14/18, 10:12:58 AM] <xseveras713x> that i did know, despite not knowing a whole lot about the sandman material
[06/14/18, 10:12:59 AM] <iceilluser> @geekmomma3 local libraries deserve all the support they can get and i wish they would get more of the local budget
[06/14/18, 10:13:02 AM] <mommypanda35> So Amy.... Who is Sandman?
[06/14/18, 10:13:12 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Matt has been preparing for reading Sandman for all his life
[06/14/18, 10:13:15 AM] <darkofnate> I seriously need to finish Sandman. I'm through 8 volumes.
[06/14/18, 10:13:19 AM] <stargazer1977> Sandman was a rite of passage, for sure.
[06/14/18, 10:13:23 AM] <EmilytheBard> i just started to read sandman less than a week ago because of these folks! its sooo goodd
[06/14/18, 10:13:27 AM] <CharacterStigma> gandsTrinketArmor My Brothers sucked lol
[06/14/18, 10:13:36 AM] <ToonEzon> QUESTION: would you guys mind posting a list of the best collections of sandman and the order in which to read them, bc these days, there are different folds of collections and it can get confusing
