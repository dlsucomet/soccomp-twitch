[06/15/18, 7:02:40 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green has a unique style all his own. We can't always explain it, but rest assured, he's always going to look dapper AF.
[06/15/18, 7:03:03 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Ryan knows what's best for business, brother.
[06/15/18, 7:03:05 AM] <shidareAKI> look at our handsome gentlemen hosts, hi guys!

[06/15/18, 7:03:56 AM] <JeffM0307> @shidareAKI Hi Aki
[06/15/18, 7:04:02 AM] <Ossborn> Wrestling never was huge in my country, I remember as a kid, there were some matches shown on some TV station... at first I liked it, then I discovered it was all fake...
[06/15/18, 7:04:03 AM] <shidareAKI> hooow you all doin
[06/15/18, 7:04:08 AM] <vexelghost> John Cena an actor? Kappa

[06/15/18, 7:04:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Yames007
[06/15/18, 7:04:25 AM] <shidareAKI> My mom = obsessed with wrestling. It was a cornerstone of my southern upbringing
[06/15/18, 7:05:43 AM] <chaoticloony> Chris Benoit is still one of my favorite wrestlers along with Bam Bam Bigelow, Bruiser Brody and Gail Kim!
[06/15/18, 7:06:09 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Wait, what happened to Gail Kim?>
[06/15/18, 7:06:18 AM] <zetasubject> ROH ROH
[06/15/18, 7:06:18 AM] <chaoticloony> ECW was so Fabulous!
[06/15/18, 7:06:19 AM] <Andyinsomnia> ECW was brutal
[06/15/18, 7:06:41 AM] <Nemisar> Sub and Resubs gandsHype gandsLessthanthree
[06/15/18, 7:06:54 AM] <Yames007> I am lfg for dnd in Oceanside Ca
[06/15/18, 7:07:09 AM] <chaoticloony> @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman She is the last of my favorite wrestlers still alive!
[06/15/18, 7:07:35 AM] <vexelghost> WWE is the Disney of wrestling. Gobble up the competition and ruin it like Star Wars.
[06/15/18, 7:07:41 AM] <zetasubject> WCW had great cruiserweights like Kidman etc
[06/15/18, 7:07:42 AM] <Andyinsomnia> WCW was one of the worst run companies in history which is a shame because they had the talent to keep going and be bigger than WWE
[06/15/18, 7:08:41 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> @Andyinsomnia Yeah but they had SO MUCH talent that they couldn't possibly use every episode.
[06/15/18, 7:09:23 AM] <Karmakat91> cheer1
[06/15/18, 7:09:24 AM] <Diamondsteelix> cheer1
[06/15/18, 7:09:26 AM] <Dubward> afc nfc
[06/15/18, 7:09:30 AM] <vexelghost> Is Lucha Underground still around? Saw a few episodes on Netflix and is was pretty good.
[06/15/18, 7:09:38 AM] <Andyinsomnia> yeah that was part of the being poorly run. people were earning 6 figure sums to wrestle twice a year @ThorIsBetterThanSuperman
[06/15/18, 7:09:50 AM] <chaoticloony> @vexelghost I believe it is still going
[06/15/18, 7:10:05 AM] <BurningHeat857> !whois
[06/15/18, 7:10:14 AM] <Andyinsomnia> !whodat
[06/15/18, 7:10:14 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green ( twitter.com/HydroSnail ), Hector Navarro ( twitter.com/Hectorisfunny ) with guest Mark B Donica ( twitter.com/MarkBDonica )
[06/15/18, 7:10:22 AM] <shidareAKI> @Andyinsomnia I imagine a few of them had the names and reps to back up being paid that much.
[06/15/18, 7:10:32 AM] <zetasubject> Wrestlers are traveling 360 days
[06/15/18, 7:10:45 AM] <shidareAKI> @Andyinsomnia I wonder how much Dwayne would need to be paid now to make a comeback to wrestling.
[06/15/18, 7:10:54 AM] <chaoticloony> Live shows occasionally have a title change
[06/15/18, 7:10:54 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> Hey Mark, explain Kayfabe for us.
[06/15/18, 7:12:04 AM] <stargazer1977> Ugh, I hate Pro Wrestling, especially as someone who used to real wrestle in school. I'll be back next week.
[06/15/18, 7:12:10 AM] <Andyinsomnia> @shidareaki, It would be crazy, his own fee would be huge and there are issues with movie insurence people who would want a lot to let him wrestle
[06/15/18, 7:12:14 AM] <chaoticloony> Later @stargazer1977
[06/15/18, 7:12:25 AM] <Dubward> The Miz came from MTV so there is a possibility of crossover knowledge for Hector
[06/15/18, 7:12:40 AM] <YAMILyamilYAMIL> this is the best crossover of my interests: GeekandSundry and wrasslin, who else is in Flair country! WOO!!!
[06/15/18, 7:13:18 AM] <chaoticloony> Never a fan of Flair, but i respect the hell out of him!
[06/15/18, 7:13:51 AM] <zetasubject> It comes from circus speak
[06/15/18, 7:13:53 AM] <Andyinsomnia> kayfabe could probably have a whole episode to itself on its history
[06/15/18, 7:13:54 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> I've peaked again.
[06/15/18, 7:14:20 AM] <YAMILyamilYAMIL> Kayfabe is pig latin for Fake, not named after someone sorry
[06/15/18, 7:14:29 AM] <brooklynbrat42> if ur a fan of Mr.Flair watch the Rick Flair Drip music video. Dude musta had a blast shooting it lmao
