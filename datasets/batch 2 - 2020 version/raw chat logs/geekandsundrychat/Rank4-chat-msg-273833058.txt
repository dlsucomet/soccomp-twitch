[06/16/18, 7:09:16 AM] <BlackLionoftheStars> so, I think I missed the nerdist news info, anyone want to give me a quick update without triggering anyone? :)
[06/16/18, 7:09:18 AM] <darkofnate> If your curious, it's all over the internet. This is not the right forum to discuss it.

[06/16/18, 7:09:39 AM] <shidareAKI> @shandravdeg it was back when it was a possibility that I may be able to join the lower decks episode when it was first mentioned that they told me.
[06/16/18, 7:09:45 AM] <misroi> Short version: Chris Hardwick is an asshole.
[06/16/18, 7:09:56 AM] <gogt200> If you google Chris Hardwick you'll find out real quick.
[06/16/18, 7:10:06 AM] <ThatCallisto> it's trending on Twitter, you can read the statement there.
