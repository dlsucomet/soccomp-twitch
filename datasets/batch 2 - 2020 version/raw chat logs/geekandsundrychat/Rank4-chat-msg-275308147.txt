[06/20/18, 7:04:15 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> I can see the game being subpar, at least when compared to general release games. Most games based off of movies are poor in quality. We can hope though!
[06/20/18, 7:04:24 AM] <PSWii2008> Ha!
[06/20/18, 7:04:27 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Who is guesting on talk machina?

[06/20/18, 7:12:15 AM] <dayntee> I'm torn between KH3 and Smash Brothers Ultimate
[06/20/18, 7:12:22 AM] <dayntee> Both are super hype for me
[06/20/18, 7:12:24 AM] <starpilotsix> For me Cyberpunk 2077,and although it's still early, Bethesda's Starfield, a single-player Sci-Fi RPG might wind up being really cool.
[06/20/18, 7:12:26 AM] <Zismarith> I think Chloe had a gun for like a minute.
[06/20/18, 7:12:28 AM] <zer0cypher> No gun? I don't inderstand...
