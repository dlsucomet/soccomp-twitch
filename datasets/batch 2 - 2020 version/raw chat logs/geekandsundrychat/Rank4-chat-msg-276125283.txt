[06/22/18, 7:06:03 AM] <raphofgreengables> lot of big names there
[06/22/18, 7:06:15 AM] <stargazer1977> Those are all great groups to tour with. But Rammstein is especially interesting because of all the stage setup that they do. They are widely known for their pyrotechnics.
[06/22/18, 7:06:35 AM] <stoutpants> What band was he in?
[06/22/18, 7:06:51 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @stoutpants Godhead
[06/22/18, 7:06:51 AM] <stargazer1977> He was lead singer of Godhead.
[06/22/18, 7:06:55 AM] <raphofgreengables> wasn't rs tossed out of the us

[06/22/18, 7:09:42 AM] ** Chovexani waves Hey everyone Hey Jason you super star!
[06/22/18, 7:09:45 AM] <Ossborn> Rammstein
[06/22/18, 7:10:02 AM] <desertshaddow> It's on one of my playlist. It's one of my favorite songs on the album :D
[06/22/18, 7:10:08 AM] <raphofgreengables> rammstein wrote that as satire
[06/22/18, 7:10:34 AM] <vexelghost> I would switch to vinyl if I could but I just went through my 300+ CDs recently.
