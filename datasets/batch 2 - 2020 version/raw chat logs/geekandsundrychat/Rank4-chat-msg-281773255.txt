[07/7/18, 12:04:43 PM] <stargazer1977> I didn't like Jurassic Park, the movie. I was very disappointed in it. The book was far better, in my opinion. And I already wanted to be a scientist well before that movie came out, but I'm old.
[07/7/18, 12:04:50 PM] <pagerunnerj> I applaud your party zebra decision.

[07/7/18, 12:07:18 PM] <super390> NASA is notoriously stingy about giving employees free t-shirts.
[07/7/18, 12:07:21 PM] <misssunflower94> is that a regulation helmet?
[07/7/18, 12:07:22 PM] <phoenixgoth> @adamkunn Yes, temporarily, by burning magnesium ribbons...
[07/7/18, 12:07:23 PM] <RealMicah> But he does have an MST3K shirt, which is totally cool!

[07/7/18, 12:08:20 PM] <divasha> hahahahaha
[07/7/18, 12:08:23 PM] <undercovergoth> Wouldn't Ben Franklin have been blinded by science when he did the kite lighting experiment?
[07/7/18, 12:08:24 PM] <octopizzy> has anyone ever used the eyeball washer

[07/7/18, 12:08:45 PM] <stargazer1977> I've been blinded and burned by science. @adamkunn Blinded temporarily while working on a laser array for the U of U cosmic ray detector. Burned while working on a nuclear reactor by a 99% pure chemical.
[07/7/18, 12:08:51 PM] <rayjoestar> I‚Äôve seen the solar eclipse with Bill Nye glasses
[07/7/18, 12:08:52 PM] <misssunflower94> Strangers here to validate you!

[07/7/18, 12:09:14 PM] <ResearchDump> I just want to see Gina react to things. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm here for.
[07/7/18, 12:09:19 PM] <Fu4ow> was it that Watson who ripped off someone's work or was it the DNA Watson?
[07/7/18, 12:09:22 PM] <Adamkunn> @stargazer1977 I'm guessing you had a complete recorvery, sir/ma'am?
[07/7/18, 12:09:24 PM] <MeggieMay328> you can find this type of stuff in Hobby Lobby
[07/7/18, 12:09:27 PM] <RealMicah> I was temporarily made immobile by science. Concussed due to a high school experiment gone wrong.
[07/7/18, 12:09:27 PM] <BijutsuYoukai> Safety regulations lead to a sad lack of good science toys.
[07/7/18, 12:09:29 PM] <misssunflower94> Taliesin I love your weekly trips to find toys for these parties
[07/7/18, 12:09:31 PM] <eazydaredevil> Question: did you guys do science experiments and if so, what one was your favorite?
[07/7/18, 12:09:32 PM] <misssunflower94> it's precious
[07/7/18, 12:09:36 PM] <stargazer1977> @japenrose yeah, was a very bad burn, turned the skin white on my hand for a long time.
[07/7/18, 12:09:38 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> QUESTION: Taliesin any news on the dolphins?
[07/7/18, 12:09:42 PM] <GenericNerd> Talisen you have every right to be deeply disappointed
[07/7/18, 12:09:43 PM] <octopizzy> taliesin has the same hand tremor i do lol
[07/7/18, 12:09:44 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> One advantage of Physics degree was getting eclipse glasses from alumni association.
[07/7/18, 12:09:44 PM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> I almost burned my hand in science class. Almost spilled chemicals on my lap too.
[07/7/18, 12:09:45 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> Anyone else getting audio interference?
[07/7/18, 12:09:47 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> cheer200 Science!!! <3
[07/7/18, 12:09:47 PM] <misssunflower94> do NOT eat the science!
[07/7/18, 12:09:48 PM] <g0rmyr> uh, is this basically colored diaper fill?
[07/7/18, 12:09:48 PM] <realitymanifold> waterlock?
[07/7/18, 12:09:51 PM] <MeggieMay328> there isn't a Michaels in my area so no idea if they have stuff
[07/7/18, 12:09:52 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> Orbeez??
[07/7/18, 12:09:54 PM] <perfectcosima> gotta eat the science
[07/7/18, 12:09:55 PM] <Fu4ow> it was the DNA Watson
[07/7/18, 12:09:57 PM] <GeekandSundry> Didn't Bell coin the term "Hello" as the greeting for the telephone over "Ahoy Hoy" ?
[07/7/18, 12:09:58 PM] <fabledfirbolg> Yeaaaah I bet that has a big DO NOT EAT on them lol
[07/7/18, 12:09:59 PM] <stargazer1977> @adamkunn can still see a bit of discoloration on my hand, but basically a full recovery. :)
[07/7/18, 12:10:00 PM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: Can I eat the science?
[07/7/18, 12:10:02 PM] <DEATHlikescats> Looks like Fruity pebbles
[07/7/18, 12:10:10 PM] <octopizzy> this is already going in an oddly satisfying compilation on youtube
[07/7/18, 12:10:14 PM] <seratonia> But is this the new cereal?
[07/7/18, 12:10:18 PM] <phoenixgoth> NOPE
[07/7/18, 12:10:21 PM] <flipflurpington> Yay insurance!
[07/7/18, 12:10:22 PM] <japenrose> @stargazer1977 I imagine so. I've only every had a tiny chemical burn because in 8th grade they forgot to give us gloves when working with acid. So I can't even IMAGINE how painful that must have been for you
[07/7/18, 12:10:24 PM] <phoenixgoth> We're not worried, Amy!
[07/7/18, 12:10:26 PM] <misssunflower94> TERRIBLE THINGS! HUZZAH
[07/7/18, 12:10:27 PM] <mathemagician_> @misssunflower94 usually you should not eat the science
[07/7/18, 12:10:29 PM] <GenericNerd> We trust talisen way to much
[07/7/18, 12:10:30 PM] <BijutsuYoukai> It's all in the name of science, Amy, it's fine.
[07/7/18, 12:10:31 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> Amy you are not in lab safety gear! open toed shoes???
[07/7/18, 12:10:32 PM] <Vance1982> wasn't there a very dangerous science toy in the 50's that had actual uranium in it?
[07/7/18, 12:10:35 PM] <RealMicah> Big bowl of what, Amy?!
[07/7/18, 12:10:37 PM] <fabledfirbolg> terrible thing never happen with the Pyramid around
[07/7/18, 12:10:37 PM] <sunlitlake> @misssunflower94 you can ALWAYS eat the Science, just sometimes it will be the last thing you will ever eat
[07/7/18, 12:10:37 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> :D
[07/7/18, 12:10:39 PM] <Darastrygat> @misssunflower94 There's a list on the internet of Can I Lick The Science. It's hilarious.
[07/7/18, 12:10:41 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I have spilled a container of acetone in my lap in a science lab. That was uncomfortable.
[07/7/18, 12:10:42 PM] <Mackles> "Is everyone worried?" *Everyone says no but the guy with the helmet from NASA*
[07/7/18, 12:10:44 PM] <phoenixgoth> @mathemagician_ I remember a lab where we made cottage cheese... that is edible x3
[07/7/18, 12:10:46 PM] <FallzVentus> Everything will be fine!!
[07/7/18, 12:10:50 PM] <hakinna> osmosis?
[07/7/18, 12:10:53 PM] <KaiOrAya> You know that Tumblr post about licking the science? don't eat the science either
[07/7/18, 12:10:54 PM] <PFWScott> I heard that Bell wanted "Ahoy" and was disgruntled that "Hello" won out, but I can't source that. Research time!
[07/7/18, 12:10:59 PM] <octopizzy> everything is edible but not everything is safe
[07/7/18, 12:11:00 PM] <lonlygnome> An oceanographer says you're right Taliesin!
[07/7/18, 12:11:03 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> Don't eat science. Math, however, you can chow down on.
[07/7/18, 12:11:04 PM] <misssunflower94> No one should be worried nothing wrong can possibly go happen
[07/7/18, 12:11:05 PM] <octopizzy> duh
[07/7/18, 12:11:08 PM] <flipflurpington> @Vance1982 Glow in the dark watches
[07/7/18, 12:11:09 PM] <Factorofunknowns> @GeekandSundry He started with Ahoy Hoy, there was a contest by a newspaper (can't remember which one) to choose an alternative.
[07/7/18, 12:11:11 PM] <japenrose> Fossils!
[07/7/18, 12:11:12 PM] <Smarcey> Bill Nye and Miss Frizzle were my gateways.
[07/7/18, 12:11:14 PM] <octopizzy> can i eat art
[07/7/18, 12:11:19 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> Volcano. Called it.
[07/7/18, 12:11:22 PM] <octopizzy> will people get mad at me if i eat their art
[07/7/18, 12:11:26 PM] <misssunflower94> I got into science because my mom is a mechanical engineer
[07/7/18, 12:11:26 PM] <Smarcey> Plus space rockets are kinda rad
[07/7/18, 12:11:27 PM] <japenrose> @TheJerseyDriver Not division though, it makes one hungrier
[07/7/18, 12:11:30 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Sign in the radioactivity lab at my college. Do not eat the radioactive samples!
[07/7/18, 12:11:31 PM] <DEATHlikescats> Yassssssssssssssss big experiment time
[07/7/18, 12:11:32 PM] <GenericNerd> Bill nye was my gateway
[07/7/18, 12:11:39 PM] <stargazer1977> @japenrose you just have to only insert extremely pure chemicals into a reactor because the radiation can make some very radioactive isotopes of things that are impurities that we introduce into the main coolant loop. :)
[07/7/18, 12:11:40 PM] <Adamkunn> One thing I would do whenever I went to Chicago during my college days at UI in Champaign was try to get someone to go to the museum and aquarium with me.
[07/7/18, 12:11:41 PM] <qui_squared> Anybody else grow up watching Julius Sumner Miller?
[07/7/18, 12:11:47 PM] <Merrily_Mirthful> You can eat all the art you pay for.
[07/7/18, 12:11:48 PM] <octopizzy> i work at lush and i love explaining basic science to ppl with bath bombs and such
[07/7/18, 12:11:49 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Mythbusters helped with that a lot! :D
[07/7/18, 12:11:50 PM] <misssunflower94> I didn't get the science smart brain but I did get super into science always
[07/7/18, 12:11:50 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> @japenrose Solid point
[07/7/18, 12:11:52 PM] <Shadowstorm_0> Its not fun to be wrong in computer science though
[07/7/18, 12:11:54 PM] <octopizzy> science roolz
[07/7/18, 12:11:56 PM] <KaiOrAya> Petition for Magic School Bus with Tal and Amy?
[07/7/18, 12:11:57 PM] <seratonia> The reason I went into science is crime shows now I study toxicology because I learn how to get away with murder
[07/7/18, 12:11:57 PM] <completely_nobody> I'm hearing a pretty harsh buzzing. I don't believe it's on my end.
[07/7/18, 12:11:57 PM] <fabledfirbolg> Bill Nye and Steve Irwin were my intros to science. very different kinds of science but still lol
[07/7/18, 12:12:00 PM] <FallzVentus> Magnets. Magnets got me slightly interested in science.
[07/7/18, 12:12:02 PM] <MasterSteel> what about BEAKMAN
[07/7/18, 12:12:04 PM] <longingfordeath_damsel> <3 <3 <3
[07/7/18, 12:12:05 PM] <radioactivealto> eating art could be very bad depending on the pigments
[07/7/18, 12:12:05 PM] <IodineEm> meanwhile my science field is relative safe and free of chemicals
[07/7/18, 12:12:09 PM] <misssunflower94> oh man Magic School Bus was my SHIT
[07/7/18, 12:12:12 PM] <littlehana> there is a science video with water marbles on the youtubes
