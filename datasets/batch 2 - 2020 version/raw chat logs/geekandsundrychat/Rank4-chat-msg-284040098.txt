[07/13/18, 7:08:43 AM] <Dubward> this intro is great
[07/13/18, 7:08:48 AM] <ghosthack159> someone needs to put the hamsters to the lash....

[07/13/18, 7:08:59 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi Ryan and Hector!

[07/13/18, 7:09:17 AM] <chaoticloony> @later @MechaHaxGames
[07/13/18, 7:09:42 AM] <stargazer1977> I love An American Weerewolf in London, and the classic Universal creature feature, Wolfman. But my favorite werewolf movie is Ginger Snaps.
[07/13/18, 7:09:43 AM] <Zismarith> Oh hey @guerulfus lookit that.
[07/13/18, 7:09:46 AM] <chaoticloony> Therewolves!
[07/13/18, 7:09:48 AM] <gamingnerd018> Werewolfs Where here Kappa
[07/13/18, 7:09:48 AM] <KBTibbs> wear woofs?
[07/13/18, 7:09:49 AM] <ghosthack159> Anyone else suddenly want Taquitos....?
[07/13/18, 7:09:49 AM] <rosewoodfigurine> New here, is it normal for the audio to be slightly behind?
[07/13/18, 7:09:51 AM] <jasfora01> Talk about weer
[07/13/18, 7:09:53 AM] <super390> THERE... WOLF.
[07/13/18, 7:09:54 AM] <DJPheonyx> Werewolf? There wolf
[07/13/18, 7:09:55 AM] <RuzgofDI> Where wolves? here. Here wolves!
[07/13/18, 7:09:56 AM] <starpilotsix> I prefer Werewolves to Right-Therewolves.
[07/13/18, 7:09:56 AM] <gamingnerd018> Herewolves
[07/13/18, 7:09:58 AM] <chaoticloony> @stargazer1977 I agree
[07/13/18, 7:10:04 AM] <Arsoncrafts> YAY
[07/13/18, 7:10:07 AM] <KBTibbs> Werewolves, not swearwoves!
[07/13/18, 7:10:08 AM] <RuzgofDI> @super390 There, castle?
[07/13/18, 7:10:16 AM] <ghosthack159> Love her hair
[07/13/18, 7:10:19 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I can't wait til they explain how werewolf mythos proves sparkly vampires can be a thing
[07/13/18, 7:10:33 AM] <gamingnerd018> Funky green hair
[07/13/18, 7:10:42 AM] <stargazer1977> Love that she also did her eyebrows the same green. That's a very nice touch.
[07/13/18, 7:10:54 AM] <ghosthack159> @stargazer1977 right?
[07/13/18, 7:11:02 AM] <DJPheonyx> I have an idea for an episode of Loremasters. I want to suggest it, but don't want to blast it on something like Twitter
[07/13/18, 7:11:12 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> what if that is her natural hair color and she just dyes the roots...
[07/13/18, 7:11:32 AM] <ghosthack159> I want to eat the taquitos on the table.
[07/13/18, 7:11:34 AM] <stargazer1977> Then I would say she is related to Osiris.
[07/13/18, 7:11:37 AM] <starpilotsix> Wolfman's got nards!
[07/13/18, 7:11:41 AM] <chaoticloony> I always love the Anime colored hair.
[07/13/18, 7:11:44 AM] <germandrewboat> when does CR start?
[07/13/18, 7:11:48 AM] <otherdoc> Mac's appearances on Happy Jack's RPG podcast (and its accompanying RPG campaigns) are always delightful and entertaining.
[07/13/18, 7:11:55 AM] <chaoticloony> @germandrewboat 2 hours
[07/13/18, 7:11:58 AM] <stargazer1977> That color of green was his color in Egyptian mythology. Hence why many cultures associate green with the underworld or death.
[07/13/18, 7:12:00 AM] <germandrewboat> thank you!
[07/13/18, 7:12:04 AM] <stargazer1977> He was also the Egyptian god of the underworld.
[07/13/18, 7:12:14 AM] <NotJez> it had to be the universal movies
[07/13/18, 7:12:15 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Literal food groups in the cereal aisle
[07/13/18, 7:12:28 AM] <chaoticloony> @germandrewboat i mean 3 hours
[07/13/18, 7:12:28 AM] <Arsoncrafts> @otherdoc, she's on HJ tomorrow.
[07/13/18, 7:12:34 AM] <ghosthack159> BooBerry, ya'll
[07/13/18, 7:12:52 AM] <IntrepidMrRico> Hector with the excellent questions
[07/13/18, 7:13:07 AM] <stargazer1977> Almost all those Universal horror movies, the creature is very relatable and often the hero of the story.
[07/13/18, 7:13:16 AM] <stargazer1977> That is true of Wolfman and many others.
[07/13/18, 7:13:36 AM] <SouperDumpling> yar, Hector is a terrific interviewer
[07/13/18, 7:13:53 AM] <clevertaggoeshere> hey, my subscription ran out for a couple days, i've resubscribed but I've been kicked off the discord, can I get the link again, please?
[07/13/18, 7:14:05 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> also why Old Yeller was such a moving story...

[07/13/18, 7:16:35 AM] <starpilotsix> Jack Russell, because Jack Russell Terrier
[07/13/18, 7:16:55 AM] <stargazer1977> Yeah, that classic catholic guilt.
[07/13/18, 7:17:00 AM] <stargazer1977> It's rather infamous.
[07/13/18, 7:17:00 AM] <DJPheonyx> Catholic self loathing? Check... and can confirm it exists
[07/13/18, 7:17:33 AM] <gamingnerd018> #OFFTOPIC
[07/13/18, 7:17:57 AM] <starpilotsix> Common confusion though, Rahne isn't a catholic but a Scots Presbyterian.
[07/13/18, 7:18:05 AM] <TheGenePool> Different podast
[07/13/18, 7:18:10 AM] <chaoticloony> Off topic is on topic on this channel!
[07/13/18, 7:18:14 AM] <desertshaddow> QUESTION: Shifters have risen through the warewolf group as it were before coming into their own. When and how did shifters start becoming their own group?
[07/13/18, 7:18:15 AM] <otherdoc> What color traffic light causes werewolf transformations?
[07/13/18, 7:18:16 AM] <ghosthack159> When do we talk about Ginger Snaps?
[07/13/18, 7:18:16 AM] <Fu4ow> is it so hard to just make driving accessible for color blind people???
[07/13/18, 7:18:20 AM] <JacobMeredith1991> Is there critical role tonight or are they still off?
[07/13/18, 7:18:34 AM] <moo5003> yes
[07/13/18, 7:18:39 AM] <starpilotsix> QUESTION: What is your favorite non-wolf Were-creature?
[07/13/18, 7:18:43 AM] <thetruebluered> should be back tonight
[07/13/18, 7:18:48 AM] <chaoticloony> @JacobMeredith1991 In 2 hours 45 minutes
[07/13/18, 7:19:04 AM] <DJPheonyx> @JacobMeredith1991 There will be new CR tonight in new studio
[07/13/18, 7:19:07 AM] <stargazer1977> I like werewolves, and I love Ginger Snaps, but my favorite lycanthropes are werepanthers.
[07/13/18, 7:19:09 AM] <NotJez> What about wolfweres
[07/13/18, 7:19:28 AM] <ghosthack159> WereBuffalo
[07/13/18, 7:19:59 AM] <StickDeath1> from the expanded Werewolf the Apocalypse, were-dinos, werebears and werecrocs are my favs
[07/13/18, 7:20:09 AM] <jasfora01> WereDolphins? can exist?
[07/13/18, 7:20:09 AM] <otherdoc> I once ran a Deadlands campaign with werebison in it. They were rather minotaur-like. :)
[07/13/18, 7:20:13 AM] <rosewoodfigurine> Or the lizard man in the xfiles reboot
[07/13/18, 7:20:16 AM] <stargazer1977> Cat People was an amazing movie, one of my favorite classic horror movies.
[07/13/18, 7:20:28 AM] <stargazer1977> Cat People is mostly about fear of female sexuality, much like Ginger Snaps is.
[07/13/18, 7:20:30 AM] <Fu4ow> I wonder how much of it comes from the time there were multiple homo-species around
[07/13/18, 7:20:33 AM] <Zismarith> I was a fan of the werebear and weredragon in Altered Beast.
[07/13/18, 7:20:36 AM] <ghosthack159> Or they were supernatural animals who could pretend to be human
[07/13/18, 7:20:58 AM] <StickDeath1> Stephen King's Silver Bullet was and is a great book/movie
[07/13/18, 7:21:06 AM] <Nightbot> Want the inside scoop? Join the cast of Critical Role and discuss this episode right here on Talks Machina. Tuesdays 7pm Pacific at twitch.tv/geekandsundry and projectalpha.com

[07/13/18, 7:21:21 AM] <gamingnerd018> LUL
[07/13/18, 7:21:33 AM] <Splattercatt> @Zismarith The werebear in Altered Beast made me feel as though only I could prevent Forest Fires. :D
[07/13/18, 7:21:37 AM] <ghosthack159> Also eating human flesh to become
[07/13/18, 7:21:48 AM] <Zismarith> @splattercatt HA!!
[07/13/18, 7:21:59 AM] <stargazer1977> A lot of that was just crap spread around by The Witch's Hammer, what a horrible book.
[07/13/18, 7:22:20 AM] <stargazer1977> Killed a whole lot of people.
[07/13/18, 7:22:25 AM] <Arsoncrafts> literally demonized.
[07/13/18, 7:22:26 AM] <ghosthack159> Mallus Maleficarum boooy
[07/13/18, 7:22:35 AM] <Arsoncrafts> i.e. turned into demons
