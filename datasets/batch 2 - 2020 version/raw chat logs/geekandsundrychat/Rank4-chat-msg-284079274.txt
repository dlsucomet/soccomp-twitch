[07/13/18, 2:39:28 PM] <angelcorps3> Choose one object, creature, or {{"""magic effect"""}} within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. If the spell is 4th level or higher, make a check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

[07/13/18, 2:40:10 PM] <Vile_> @angelcorps3 Slow is cast as a cube but does not persist as one. Think of it as a spell that can target multiple people, but those people get individual debuffs.

[07/13/18, 2:44:44 PM] <Ogeard> TPK
[07/13/18, 2:44:44 PM] <nonegoodleft> gotta run
[07/13/18, 2:44:45 PM] <spearlikehail> wait doesn't molly have a pendent to bring him back ?
[07/13/18, 2:44:46 PM] <Evillisa> THIS IS SICK MATT
[07/13/18, 2:44:46 PM] <tamanoko> I hope they find a way to revive him if they make it outta this. As much as I'd love to see what else Taliesin can come up with, I want to know more about Mollymauk!!
[07/13/18, 2:44:49 PM] <HeadHunterDW> I won't lie, this feels pretty unbalanced given the party's circumstances put onto them by the DM. I feel like he's aware though, so there'l most likely be a good chance of saving Molly through story.
[07/13/18, 2:44:50 PM] <TheJohnMatrix> time for season 3
[07/13/18, 2:44:52 PM] <kingcas1> guys maybe the firbolg knows some reviving magic or something
[07/13/18, 2:44:52 PM] <SlatzorBarbarian> RIP Molly
[07/13/18, 2:44:53 PM] <spidermike08> the necklace only activates at the start of Molly's turn

[07/13/18, 2:44:57 PM] <Metoma> I wonder if molly, as a spirit, can enter the body of another dead body for his next character
[07/13/18, 2:45:00 PM] <ImTheWienerDog> HOLY TITS
[07/13/18, 2:45:00 PM] <MyDogIsAnIdiot> Molly shouldnt have taken sneak attack damage initially. there was disadvantage on the attack.

[07/13/18, 2:45:26 PM] <Morphineus> I can almost imagine Laura just giving baby Blam to Travis and running to the studio yelling "I HAVE REVIVIFY!"
[07/13/18, 2:45:26 PM] <MrNotSoBright> Guys, the necklace does not help molly here
[07/13/18, 2:45:26 PM] <madhatman66> they need to retreat.
