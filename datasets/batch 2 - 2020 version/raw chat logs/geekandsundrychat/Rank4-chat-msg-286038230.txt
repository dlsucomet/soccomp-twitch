[07/18/18, 8:15:25 AM] <epixxfish> that beige dress is SO cool and reminds me of steampunk!
[07/18/18, 8:15:32 AM] <nerdstroms> I love that Amy's down on the whodat as Internet Sensation Amy Dallen
[07/18/18, 8:15:35 AM] <vexelghost> No AC with all that equipment. My sympathies.
[07/18/18, 8:15:42 AM] <Gkgamerfan> forced Windows updates or something?
[07/18/18, 8:15:48 AM] <Critternation3000> blondi3FINE blondi3FINE blondi3FINE
[07/18/18, 8:16:04 AM] <CYZLAK> Sounds like a scene out of Silent Hill

[07/18/18, 8:16:08 AM] <Ossborn> I wasnt able to watch Scaredy Cats in such a long time :-(
[07/18/18, 8:16:09 AM] <AtmaPrime> 'Something' manMVG
[07/18/18, 8:16:21 AM] <feathersflight> Why are you putting Amy through this?
[07/18/18, 8:16:26 AM] <ghosthack159> Streamers Beware, You're in for a Scare
[07/18/18, 8:16:30 AM] <KBTibbs> Amy has lost a hand. :(
[07/18/18, 8:16:31 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> How great would it be if VR was able to actually simulate touch. then the ghost child could grab your ankle for real.
[07/18/18, 8:16:33 AM] <darkofnate> Just think, Amy, you could have been playing Dream Daddy tonight instead...
[07/18/18, 8:16:35 AM] <CYZLAK> lmao
[07/18/18, 8:16:36 AM] <AtmaPrime> Start out already missing a hand D:
[07/18/18, 8:16:40 AM] <KaiOrAya> Floating disembodied singular hand would be pretty horrifying
[07/18/18, 8:16:46 AM] <the_miniature_dragon> Man I haven't seen Trisha since her Sourcefed days
[07/18/18, 8:16:46 AM] <CYZLAK> hard mode engaged
[07/18/18, 8:16:50 AM] <cinphoria> .....I question their decision to make your hands _disembodied_ in a horror game.
[07/18/18, 8:16:52 AM] <KBTibbs> And it's only the left hand.
[07/18/18, 8:17:00 AM] <Jewishhulk> kek
[07/18/18, 8:17:04 AM] <KBTibbs> HANDS!
[07/18/18, 8:17:11 AM] <AtmaPrime> Had her hand for a moment..and then it just wondered off D:
[07/18/18, 8:17:12 AM] <super390> You play as the Addams FamilyÂ´s Thing.
[07/18/18, 8:17:14 AM] <KaiOrAya> Ooh! Two hands now!
[07/18/18, 8:17:21 AM] <KaiOrAya> Still creepy disembodied hands thoguh
[07/18/18, 8:17:22 AM] <KBTibbs> Bilateral symmetry achieved!
[07/18/18, 8:17:23 AM] <feathersflight> There's writing on her hand
[07/18/18, 8:17:25 AM] <Gkgamerfan> 2 Hands!
[07/18/18, 8:17:26 AM] <Ossborn> @cinphoria That turns it kind of into an Addams Family game ^^
[07/18/18, 8:17:30 AM] <Aliysium> does VR give you motion sickness if it has a gyroscope and moves with your head?
[07/18/18, 8:17:32 AM] <CYZLAK> thats exactly what i was thinking adamms family lol
[07/18/18, 8:17:34 AM] <cinphoria> :/
[07/18/18, 8:17:39 AM] <CosmicVoyagerX> Ohhhhh thats why Amy s wearing contact lenses.
[07/18/18, 8:17:42 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> as well-known for being focused, Amy might win this game in 12 minutes... KappaPride at least she won't have chat trying to distract her...
[07/18/18, 8:17:42 AM] <xGekkostatex> wait, so you're in with a badge?
[07/18/18, 8:17:45 AM] <vexelghost> Can't you just play this with on hand tied behind your back? Kappa
[07/18/18, 8:17:47 AM] <Darastrygat> @cinphoria Agreed. It ruined RE7 VR for me. Terrible immersion, which horror games depend on.
[07/18/18, 8:17:53 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> VR should make a pair of special gloves for these types of games.
[07/18/18, 8:18:00 AM] <KaiOrAya> @Alicatt It still gives me motionsickness, but mine gets set off by so many things
[07/18/18, 8:18:07 AM] <feathersflight> Rakshasa
[07/18/18, 8:18:11 AM] <AtmaPrime> Eeeeeeeeey Macarena
[07/18/18, 8:18:17 AM] <darkofnate> Is this a body horror game?
[07/18/18, 8:18:20 AM] <AtmaPrime> Raksasha~~~
[07/18/18, 8:18:28 AM] <cinphoria> *jazz hands*
[07/18/18, 8:18:31 AM] <Aliysium> so basically when i finally am not poor enough to get a headset, i'm going to need to take motion sickness meds to play xD
[07/18/18, 8:18:37 AM] <Gkgamerfan> shishWW shishWW shishWW
[07/18/18, 8:18:58 AM] <vexelghost> The HDD is going to be full of screenshots.
[07/18/18, 8:19:11 AM] <darkofnate> What will your tiny human be cosplaying as Trish?
[07/18/18, 8:19:11 AM] <kyleelliott96> Hi
[07/18/18, 8:19:15 AM] <KBTibbs> @vexelghost It's to prove it happened
[07/18/18, 8:19:28 AM] <AtmaPrime> @Alicatt It seems to affect people differently, but yeah depending on the game folks seem more susceptible to motion sickness :( Kinda why I'm worried about trying them myself
[07/18/18, 8:19:40 AM] <kyleelliott96> Have you guys Hurd of the name brad Williams on YouTube he funny
[07/18/18, 8:19:43 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> oh man did i miss the scary games?
[07/18/18, 8:20:00 AM] <KaiOrAya> @Alicatt I recommend testing it out in a store or demo somewhere before making that kind of financial commitment
[07/18/18, 8:20:03 AM] <ThorIsBetterThanSuperman> I thought the Hyrule lady had one leg for the longest time.
[07/18/18, 8:20:04 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Alicatt apparently ginger can be useful for persons afflicted with carsickness, idk it might be helpful for motion sickness #NOTanExpert
