[07/19/18, 10:06:24 AM] <KaiOrAya> Also! SD Zoo is having a special where if you come in wearing DC gear during SDCC they'll give you a discount on your entrance ticket. That's sort of assuming people have time/energy to get there, but the zoo is amazing
[07/19/18, 10:06:25 AM] <fireshadowktreva> Hooray! I'm actually on time!

[07/19/18, 10:07:26 AM] <stargazer1977> I have the first two trades of Monstress, and the 3rd comes out in a couple months.
[07/19/18, 10:07:29 AM] <darkofnate> She has "Ma" and "Ke" in her name, so that's close enough...

[07/19/18, 10:08:57 AM] <101deadpool1017> Oscars of comic books, but without all the bribery of judges
[07/19/18, 10:08:58 AM] <japenrose> @starpilotsix Only with a Rocky & Bullwinkle comic
[07/19/18, 10:08:58 AM] <AtariPinko> No details, but sorry Talieson
[07/19/18, 10:09:00 AM] <stargazer1977> With the art and story of Monstress, I would be upset if it wasn't.
[07/19/18, 10:09:02 AM] <darkofnate> We're diving right in, Tal...

[07/19/18, 10:10:27 AM] <starpilotsix> @shidareAKI Well, let's not promise that, you know how the Wednesday Club loves their tangents. They might wind up talking about random X-Men books. ;)
[07/19/18, 10:10:27 AM] <That_One_Guy212> that reminds me of the graphic novel of a girl who grew up in the middle east in the 80s(?)
[07/19/18, 10:10:39 AM] <shidareAKI> @starpilotsix ah yes true
[07/19/18, 10:10:46 AM] <tom_cruising> <3 tal

[07/19/18, 10:13:42 AM] <KaiOrAya> Clothes, badge, and the spoons to attend
[07/19/18, 10:13:43 AM] <japenrose> @JustHere4Coffee I believe that was a gift to them from a fan
[07/19/18, 10:13:44 AM] <super390> Well, that knocks me out.
[07/19/18, 10:13:45 AM] <tortugadelmar> But what about skirts, kilts etc?
[07/19/18, 10:13:47 AM] <shidareAKI> QUESTION: But what if I’m fully #TeamNoPants, Tal? It’s hot outside!
[07/19/18, 10:13:47 AM] <darkhalfelf284> Thanks for that @mathemagician_ and @japenrose I will definitely pick it up when I go by the bookstore one of these days.
[07/19/18, 10:13:49 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> and a fanatical devotion to the Pope...
[07/19/18, 10:13:52 AM] <stargazer1977> Pants are overrated, have kilt, will travel.
[07/19/18, 10:13:52 AM] <phoenixgoth> Can anyone see Taliesin's necklace?
[07/19/18, 10:13:52 AM] <darkofnate> You also need to be physically in San Diego, so I'm out...
[07/19/18, 10:13:53 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Skirt is probably OK too
[07/19/18, 10:14:00 AM] <japenrose> I still want just an Eisner's badge
[07/19/18, 10:14:09 AM] <Losile> Anything that covers the so-called important bits!

[07/19/18, 10:14:17 AM] <Danoba> It's also super hot in the studio right now...
[07/19/18, 10:14:17 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> @japenrose thanks; makes sense but I can always dream
[07/19/18, 10:14:19 AM] <RuzgofDI> Kilts... they'd probably let you in if you're rocking a kilt as well.
[07/19/18, 10:14:19 AM] <misssunflower94> I totally want Eisners badge
[07/19/18, 10:14:20 AM] <101deadpool1017> Would a kilt be acceptable at the Eisners?
[07/19/18, 10:14:25 AM] <AtariPinko> May Will Eisner rest in peace, one of the greats

[07/19/18, 10:15:51 AM] <cinphoria> Oh wow I didn't even realise that the dude who played Wong's last name is actually Wong, and also he's ALSO a Benedict
[07/19/18, 10:15:52 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> All around was gloomy, and the world was closing in, when I heard a voice call unto me "smile and be happy; things could get worse." So I smiled, and was happy, and behold - things DID get worse!
[07/19/18, 10:15:55 AM] <brassmama> QUESTION: TALS what delightfulness is in your mug?

[07/19/18, 10:16:15 AM] <super390> Felicia appears in the MST3K comic from Dark Horse!
[07/19/18, 10:16:15 AM] <Fatty_Melt> @kaioraya I did! That was such a gross situation with that company. I totally understand why she pulled it from the web
[07/19/18, 10:16:17 AM] <japenrose> @cinphoria I saw that at the end of Infinity War and got a crack out of that, it's really cool that happened!

[07/19/18, 10:17:00 AM] <stargazer1977> I approve of doing shows in the nude, too bad Twitch doesn't.
[07/19/18, 10:17:03 AM] <KaiOrAya> I heard rumor of water falling from the sky down there, but I disbelieve.

[07/19/18, 10:17:08 AM] <ArtemisRuse> Oh yeah, the random LA thunderstorm happened today yeah?
[07/19/18, 10:17:10 AM] <Fembot_ArtsyPantS> That is oddly specific, Chief.
[07/19/18, 10:17:11 AM] <shidareAKI> Mathing is my least favorite thing next to wearing pants.
[07/19/18, 10:17:14 AM] <darkofnate> Not everything digital is on the web
[07/19/18, 10:17:14 AM] <JeffM0307> Nice "Do The Right Thing" reference
[07/19/18, 10:17:16 AM] <BijutsuYoukai> It's not just Cali getting the heat wave right now. Lots of places :(
[07/19/18, 10:17:17 AM] <stargazer1977> Nice reference to "Do the Right Thing", Chief.
[07/19/18, 10:17:17 AM] <shidareAKI> Yeah we had thunderstorms today
[07/19/18, 10:17:23 AM] <shidareAKI> !weather
[07/19/18, 10:17:23 AM] <Nightbot> Weather for Los Angeles: Conditions are Mostly Cloudy with a temperature of 75F (24C). The wind is blowing from the CALM at 0mph (0km/h) and the current humidity is 73%. At the studio.
[07/19/18, 10:17:25 AM] <stargazer1977> Classic Spike Lee.
[07/19/18, 10:17:27 AM] <rabb1tdotcom> Web comics often are pretty frequent, such as weekly.
[07/19/18, 10:17:29 AM] <ladyamphy> IF you cant get to comic con to see them live you can follow along here https://twitter.com/Fanbase_Press/status/1019295677023768578
[07/19/18, 10:17:29 AM] <starpilotsix> Maybe a digital comic is a complete story that has ended and a webcomic is ongoing and may not be completed?
[07/19/18, 10:17:32 AM] <FuffyButt> the most coveted award and hardest award to attain is the perfect attendance award
[07/19/18, 10:17:33 AM] <AtariPinko> I know what New 52 means, but Im still confused
[07/19/18, 10:17:43 AM] <stargazer1977> @JeffM0307 just barely beat you to it. ;)
[07/19/18, 10:17:45 AM] <japenrose> @cinphoria He really is! I hadn't seen Dr Strange yet but he really helped sell me on wanting to see it
[07/19/18, 10:17:48 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> In some of the microclimates down here anyways
[07/19/18, 10:17:50 AM] <shidareAKI> 73% humidity omg kill me
[07/19/18, 10:17:56 AM] <fireshadowktreva> @starpilotsix seems like a solid theory to me
[07/19/18, 10:17:59 AM] <cinphoria> oh he's AMAZING
[07/19/18, 10:18:09 AM] <darkhalfelf284> @polilaue You are not the only one that is confused about that
[07/19/18, 10:18:10 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @polilaue there was a great JSA run then they split into two teams and was bad
[07/19/18, 10:18:13 AM] <ladyamphy> also i will live blogging in the Discord
[07/19/18, 10:18:14 AM] <RealMicah> Trade you, AKI... it's 83% humidity here, right now.
[07/19/18, 10:18:15 AM] <vexmeat> Good to know the west coast & east coast are suffering equally
[07/19/18, 10:18:15 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @shidareaki That's low humidity compared to here most of the time
[07/19/18, 10:18:18 AM] <seratonia> Everytime people at GnS complain about the weather I'm glad I don't live in Cali
[07/19/18, 10:18:22 AM] <Radek_M1A1> so what's todays show about?
[07/19/18, 10:18:23 AM] <ArtemisRuse> I love detective conan
[07/19/18, 10:18:28 AM] <cinphoria> I didn't understand why everyone in the watchalong I missed was going WONG! when he appeared but then he did and I was like, yep, that is a man you go WONG! \o/ for
[07/19/18, 10:18:30 AM] <darkofnate> I always thought a web comic is a comic specifically published on a web site, whereas a digital comic is just a regular comic from a publisher that is just not available in hard copy
[07/19/18, 10:18:31 AM] <ArtemisRuse> Especially the abridged versio
