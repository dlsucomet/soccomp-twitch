[07/19/18, 12:43:36 PM] <harberst> Does Stef's character also make people "disappear" by sending them to Seattle? Or is that too close to reality for the game?

[07/19/18, 12:44:04 PM] <Nightbot> Twitch doesn't have a generic RPG tag, so all RPGs get identified as D&D. It is a limitation of the platform.
