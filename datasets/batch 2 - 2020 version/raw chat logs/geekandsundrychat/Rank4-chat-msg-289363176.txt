[07/26/18, 8:03:03 AM] <Vasentic> yea normally it says you have to be subbed to even view the videos...the last few times i could view the videos anyway but they wouldnt play so it took me a bit to figure out why it was broken
[07/26/18, 8:03:18 AM] <HalfDonut> I can see Becca being all coy and acting new to the game, start doing well, and then is all "Yeah. I've actually played"
[07/26/18, 8:03:30 AM] <HalfDonut> Hi, ERIKA, BECCA and IFY!
[07/26/18, 8:03:31 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi Erika, Becca and Ify!

[07/26/18, 8:04:22 AM] <TheAAMoy> Is that IFY? Looks like he's dropped a couple of pounds.
[07/26/18, 8:04:23 AM] <super390> the Big Man has Big Hair.
[07/26/18, 8:04:27 AM] <Shadowner> Erika & Ify, back to school
[07/26/18, 8:05:00 AM] <HalfDonut> Ify and Erika may have changed, but the shenanigans will be the same, I have no doubt.
[07/26/18, 8:05:21 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> Build! That! Deck!
[07/26/18, 8:05:24 AM] <Kurezar> Alright is Ify going to get wrecked?
[07/26/18, 8:05:30 AM] <vexelghost> I'm so terrible at trading card games.
[07/26/18, 8:06:33 AM] <chaoticloony> 5 color decks can be fun
[07/26/18, 8:06:41 AM] <HalfDonut> @vexelghost feel free to ask questions, people here will surely answer!
[07/26/18, 8:06:44 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> I just got 2 foil Wrath of Gods and a foil Hadana's Climb today.
[07/26/18, 8:06:55 AM] <HalfDonut> @chaoticloony sounds like a lot of work in mana management, though.
[07/26/18, 8:07:03 AM] <Marb_04> i have beta codes for Magic the Gathering Arena for anyone who wants one

[07/26/18, 8:07:23 AM] <vexelghost> @halfdonut Appreciated. :)
[07/26/18, 8:07:36 AM] <chaoticloony> @HalfDonut It was a bit easier for me because i had 4 of each of the OG Dual Lands
[07/26/18, 8:08:30 AM] <HalfDonut> @chaoticloony nice
[07/26/18, 8:08:31 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> 5 color is a little easier in EDH
[07/26/18, 8:08:36 AM] <HalfDonut> @davidflegel hi there!
[07/26/18, 8:08:38 AM] <Perry_J> QUESTION for older sets of Magic cards, how can you tell which set the cards are from? not including stand alone sets like Iceage and Mirage.
[07/26/18, 8:08:39 AM] <Shadowner> ya dun gud kid
[07/26/18, 8:08:40 AM] <michaelhavlicek> Cool
[07/26/18, 8:09:03 AM] <super390> No-sleeve shamer? You mean like Marisha?
[07/26/18, 8:09:15 AM] <teamkills1> Mono red... itâ€™s everywhere calebdBull
[07/26/18, 8:09:23 AM] <vexelghost> Becca really is excellent at explaining game rules. :)
[07/26/18, 8:09:26 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> The symbol on the card, Perry.
[07/26/18, 8:09:28 AM] <HalfDonut> @Perry_J they will be able to say this for sure, I believe that the cards have a little icon somewhere on the card that indicates where they came from.
[07/26/18, 8:09:38 AM] <mastershake29x> @Perry_J all sets except for the first core sets have an expansion symbol on them
[07/26/18, 8:09:55 AM] <HalfDonut> @Perry_J for instance, the newer cards from the M19 set have an "M19" icon
[07/26/18, 8:09:59 AM] <AeclipsetheCat> Above the text box, on the right is a symbol for what set its from
[07/26/18, 8:10:13 AM] <chaoticloony> @Perry_J Alpha has black borders and rounded corners, Beta was black border with the standard squarish corners. Unlimited had white borders
[07/26/18, 8:10:49 AM] <Perry_J> thanks all. I'll take a look at my cards.
[07/26/18, 8:11:19 AM] <generaldavis29> cool. i see ify. do they every play the yu-gi-oh trading card game?
