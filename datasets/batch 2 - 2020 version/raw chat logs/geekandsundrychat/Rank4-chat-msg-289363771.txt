[07/26/18, 10:11:23 AM] <stargazer1977> @RMutt1917 we have that, and also a week of Hunting Vacation in the Fall. It's so important to the State that school gets out a week later than the surrounding states because of it.
[07/26/18, 10:11:23 AM] <Fembot_ArtsyPantS> It's a Matt key!
[07/26/18, 10:11:25 AM] <foxbelle> omg. that is so cute!

[07/26/18, 10:12:01 AM] <crthemighty> as an aside, the lighting is legit today
[07/26/18, 10:12:07 AM] <geminilightning> with that key, all doors are subservient to Matt Key
[07/26/18, 10:12:07 AM] <misssunflower94> Wednesday Club is the one pure thing in this world
[07/26/18, 10:12:08 AM] <japenrose> @misssunflower94 But you need to make sure they're printed on matte
[07/26/18, 10:12:12 AM] <DelayShay> Matt Key needs to put his matt key under a mat
[07/26/18, 10:12:17 AM] <stargazer1977> I like Michael Chabon a lot, but the only two books of his I love are Cavalier and Klay and The Yiddish Policeman's Union.
[07/26/18, 10:12:20 AM] <super390> Taliesin is like the hairdo Satan.

[07/26/18, 10:12:44 AM] <RMutt1917> @crthemighty the green back lighting makes me think the background is fake Kappa
[07/26/18, 10:12:45 AM] <101deadpool1017> Wednesday Club is secretly being sponsored by the Wayne Foundation.
