[08/2/18, 8:03:51 AM] <chaoticloony> @Zismarith I believe that there are only a couple more episodes after this
[08/2/18, 8:03:58 AM] <thotheads1981> Hey woms
[08/2/18, 8:04:06 AM] <Zismarith> I see. But I just glance down at the schedule on this page though.
[08/2/18, 8:04:20 AM] <postdataest> hey @thotheads1981
[08/2/18, 8:04:29 AM] <Timitor> so because of How to Play, my friend and I broke out our old Magic cards and started playing again
[08/2/18, 8:04:29 AM] <Zismarith> Oooh. 4 player coop mode.
[08/2/18, 8:04:57 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> Free-for-all

[08/2/18, 8:05:16 AM] <chaoticloony> I remember playing 8 to 10 player games, with ante!

[08/2/18, 8:05:43 AM] <Nightbot> Jessica Chobot ( twitter.com/JessicaChobot ), Andrew Bowser ( twitter.com/andrewbowser )
[08/2/18, 8:06:09 AM] <chaoticloony> Booster Draft and Sealed Deck are the best formats! Booster War is also fun!
[08/2/18, 8:06:11 AM] <Danoba> Working on it.
[08/2/18, 8:06:14 AM] <NyteRazor> hey that's the dragon's lair sound
[08/2/18, 8:06:48 AM] <NyteRazor> Commander! :O
[08/2/18, 8:07:07 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> Commander/EDH seems to be the most prevalent format.
[08/2/18, 8:07:42 AM] <GeekandSundry> Adam Hann-Byrd was Little Man Tate (fwiw)
[08/2/18, 8:07:58 AM] <GeekandSundry> and the kid in Jumanji who got pulled into the game.
[08/2/18, 8:08:19 AM] <Danoba> !whodat
[08/2/18, 8:08:19 AM] <Nightbot> Becca Scott ( twitter.com/thebeccascott ), Adam Hann-Byrd ( twitter.com/BigManTate ), Gina DeVivo ( twitter.com/PocketGina ), Erika Fermina ( twitter.com/astylepixie ), Hector Navarro ( twitter.com/Hectorisfunny ).
[08/2/18, 8:08:43 AM] <chaoticloony> #TeamAdam
[08/2/18, 8:09:03 AM] <doomdrake13> Having played magic for over 20 years now, I find these segments both amusing and bemusing.
[08/2/18, 8:09:28 AM] <doomdrake13> But all I have to say is: may you draw well.
[08/2/18, 8:09:39 AM] <tsugar> how are they playing so far apart
[08/2/18, 8:10:05 AM] <doomdrake13> its the tables fault
[08/2/18, 8:10:07 AM] <GeekandSundry> For those of you asking, we are doing Commander next week with Kyle Hill, Josh Lee Kwai! But let's enjoy the FFA battle about to take place =D
[08/2/18, 8:10:09 AM] <thotheads1981> Post is ossborn around because he loves becca
[08/2/18, 8:10:15 AM] <doomdrake13> looks like a RPG table
[08/2/18, 8:10:42 AM] <danicristie> my dream job... play games the whole day and be paid for it
[08/2/18, 8:10:46 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> I love Game Knights.
[08/2/18, 8:10:51 AM] <Grimswerth> Themed decks FTW!!
[08/2/18, 8:11:00 AM] <tsugar> no seriously how are they keeping track of people across the table
[08/2/18, 8:11:18 AM] <YanniBugatti> with Magic
[08/2/18, 8:12:00 AM] <Marb_04> do not block
[08/2/18, 8:12:13 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> Yeah, blocking here is bad.
[08/2/18, 8:12:18 AM] <tsugar> the way she says "right?" xD
[08/2/18, 8:12:26 AM] <Whattaninja> A gathering of magic if you will
[08/2/18, 8:12:35 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> Card draw is good.
[08/2/18, 8:12:39 AM] <doomdrake13> @tariqisl2 each player has a dice to keep track of their own life total; in a competitive environment both players would have pen and paper to keep track to double check.
[08/2/18, 8:12:59 AM] <tsugar> @doomdrake13 i meant the boardstate
[08/2/18, 8:13:29 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> I would assume they ask Becca, tariq.
[08/2/18, 8:13:45 AM] <doomdrake13> @tariqisl2 by asking and looking?
[08/2/18, 8:13:58 AM] <Pulse_Ender> I'm assuming these 4 people playing are new/learning?
[08/2/18, 8:13:58 AM] <doomdrake13> like in every game of magic?
[08/2/18, 8:14:49 AM] <Nemisar> Yup the whole meaning with this special run of How To Play, is to learn and play Magic The Gathering :)
[08/2/18, 8:15:03 AM] <kitciro> ;) <3
[08/2/18, 8:15:09 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role will be at 6 PM PDT on Friday, August 3rd live from GenCon! It is currently 5:15 PM PDT on Wednesday. There is 2 days 44 minutes 51 seconds until the next episode of Critical Role.
[08/2/18, 8:15:14 AM] <GeekandSundry> @Pulse_Ender Yes, and no. Some of them are new, some of been playing for years; but ultimately they just want to play some Magic. :)
[08/2/18, 8:15:50 AM] <Nemisar> I think I need to get me some MTG cards here at GenCon :)
[08/2/18, 8:15:59 AM] <JustAverageJay> @astylepixie !!!
[08/2/18, 8:16:07 AM] <JustAverageJay> Yay Erika!
[08/2/18, 8:16:14 AM] <its_whitten_a> hey guys!
[08/2/18, 8:16:18 AM] <Knight_of_BAAWA> How about a Black Lotus, WOMS.
