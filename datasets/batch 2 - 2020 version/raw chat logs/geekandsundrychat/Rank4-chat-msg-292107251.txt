[08/2/18, 10:07:58 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @feathersflight in my area the comic shops are ran by both men and women and when the guys are in the store they are just as welcoming to women as the guys so I guess that is where I come from so yeah
[08/2/18, 10:08:04 AM] <lemoneaterl> @greentea_leaf sounds like you had bad weather luck, it's not typical

[08/2/18, 10:09:02 AM] <RMutt1917> @That_One_Guy212 then you are lucky, cause not all shops are as welcoming to female readers
[08/2/18, 10:09:07 AM] <AromiaFlyce> i need this show every day
[08/2/18, 10:09:08 AM] <feathersflight> @That_One_Guy212 Walking into a store, it's hard to know if it's going to be welcoming or not. When you see women working there, it makes it feel better. I doubt she was saying that a comic shop is only good if it's only women.
[08/2/18, 10:09:09 AM] <shidareAKI> @fuffybutt that's ...what a question, why? why you do this.
[08/2/18, 10:09:15 AM] <tatzelthess> @awolvesdengames I kinda want Spiderman to try it and create the Spider-bat

[08/2/18, 10:09:49 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @RMutt1917 well then those are shit shops @feathersflight and i guess i interpreted it as only female run stores are good

[08/2/18, 10:10:07 AM] <hvillalta1991> @feathersflight Agreed. I feel way more welcome in a comic book store when there are women working there. I’m very new to comics, and I always feel more comfortable asking a woman.
