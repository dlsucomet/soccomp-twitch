[08/3/18, 1:10:53 AM] <GeekandSundry> That talking Dread tower makes some good points
[08/3/18, 1:11:16 AM] <GeekandSundry> gif incoming

[08/3/18, 1:11:30 AM] <withabrickk> TRIPPIES hahah what a name
[08/3/18, 1:11:33 AM] <GoAheadTACom> Dread is a great twist on classic Jenga. Always enjoyed Ivans work aswell
[08/3/18, 1:12:06 AM] <Henchman2121> Hey @shidareaki how bad are you missing SoT?
[08/3/18, 1:12:31 AM] <shidareAKI> @henchman2121 a lot but Iâ€™m pretty stoked for Callisto6
[08/3/18, 1:12:38 AM] <withabrickk> Can i ask, because this is new to me entirely, but what is the functionality of the game? Like how does the jenga play into it? anyone can whisper if theyd like
[08/3/18, 1:12:44 AM] <Henchman2121> @shidareaki same :)
[08/3/18, 1:12:51 AM] <solo_og> But... What IS Callisto6?
[08/3/18, 1:12:53 AM] <postdataest> #WhatIsCalisto6
[08/3/18, 1:12:55 AM] <shidareAKI> Eric and the whole cast are so great, Iâ€™d follow them into the abyss
[08/3/18, 1:12:59 AM] <xGekkostatex> !criticalrole
[08/3/18, 1:13:03 AM] <postdataest> Critical Role (C2ep29) this week will be at 6 pm Pacific time on Friday, August 3rd live from Indianapolis, Indiana, ...rather than at Thursday's usual time because of GenCon .
[08/3/18, 1:13:03 AM] <GeekandSundry> who knows what it is?
[08/3/18, 1:13:16 AM] <xGekkostatex> oh nice
[08/3/18, 1:13:21 AM] <postdataest> !gencon

[08/3/18, 1:13:53 AM] <The_TBoyce> @shidareAKI Careful...Ivan might be all too happy to create that abyss for you all. #MakeAPull
[08/3/18, 1:14:18 AM] <Henchman2121> We need to set up fake announcements for Eric. He always spills the beans during announcements.
[08/3/18, 1:14:59 AM] <The_TBoyce> I don't know why I giggled so much at "I raise my trotter to shield my eyes." :D
[08/3/18, 1:15:09 AM] <Nightbot> Critical Role will be at 6 PM PDT on Friday, August 3rd live from GenCon! It is currently 10:15 AM PDT on Thursday. There is 1 day 7 hours 44 minutes 51 seconds until the next episode of Critical Role.
[08/3/18, 1:15:18 AM] <The_TBoyce> LOL, but how awesome would "death by straw" be?
[08/3/18, 1:15:49 AM] <shidareAKI> Itâ€™s already leaning
[08/3/18, 1:16:42 AM] <The_TBoyce> Mark is so good at improv.
[08/3/18, 1:17:47 AM] <shidareAKI> Ewwwww
[08/3/18, 1:18:23 AM] <shidareAKI> HAHA B
[08/3/18, 1:18:35 AM] <The_TBoyce> In the Biblical sense! XD
[08/3/18, 1:18:45 AM] <GeekandSundry> someone in the audience has a squeak laugh that really sells the atmosphere.
[08/3/18, 1:18:46 AM] <krystinaarielle> OMG ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
[08/3/18, 1:18:59 AM] <shidareAKI> @geekandsundry I thought I was hearing that!
[08/3/18, 1:19:06 AM] <Henchman2121> Bonnie snort
[08/3/18, 1:19:07 AM] <mister_sandman_> @GeekandSundry i heard that too Jebaited
[08/3/18, 1:19:15 AM] <SprklTwnkl> The last episode of tox machina is STILL showing up as "content unavailable" for me, even after subscribing. It's all I want :(
[08/3/18, 1:19:18 AM] <leffens_visa> nice!
[08/3/18, 1:19:22 AM] <SprklTwnkl> Anyone else not able to watch the last tox machina?
[08/3/18, 1:19:26 AM] <bruwhat_p> Best Laught ever ! thank you, whoever you are
[08/3/18, 1:19:28 AM] <TriangleTable> B Dave is VIP right now.
[08/3/18, 1:19:30 AM] <leffens_visa> this guy sigbed my dread book ;)
[08/3/18, 1:19:36 AM] <DJPheonyx> Three Little Pigs as a Dread game... I LOVE IT!!!
[08/3/18, 1:19:52 AM] <shidareAKI> @sprkltwnkl there has been some issues with twitch lately. Try refreshing the page again?
[08/3/18, 1:20:19 AM] <SprklTwnkl> I have! Many times!~
[08/3/18, 1:20:25 AM] <SprklTwnkl> PRe and post subscription!
[08/3/18, 1:20:29 AM] <DJPheonyx> Is... is Mark Meer wearing a Champions of the Earth pin?
[08/3/18, 1:20:43 AM] <shidareAKI> @sprkltwnkl then itâ€™s likely an issue on Twitchâ€™s end.
[08/3/18, 1:21:08 AM] <DJPheonyx> Bonnie's pig character actually has an engineering degree :P
[08/3/18, 1:21:11 AM] <SprklTwnkl> Wish I knew before subbing D:
[08/3/18, 1:21:23 AM] <The_TBoyce> *dramatic music builds*
[08/3/18, 1:22:06 AM] <shidareAKI> @sprkltwnkl the issue will likely resolve because twitch has been trying to fix it for a few days, but the VOD will become available. Just keep trying. ðŸ’œ
[08/3/18, 1:22:56 AM] <DJPheonyx> If Bonnie fails, taking bets on her saying "Whoopsie doodle" like she did on Shield of Tomorrow
[08/3/18, 1:23:20 AM] <shidareAKI> Puppy skunk
[08/3/18, 1:23:44 AM] <DJPheonyx> I wish that the G&S Panel tomorrow is going to be livestreamed, but from what I can tell, it won't be
[08/3/18, 1:24:20 AM] <shidareAKI> @djpheonyx it wonâ€™t. Keep your eyes on twitter for announcements coming out of that panel!
[08/3/18, 1:26:27 AM] <shidareAKI> Port fed pork. Yum.
[08/3/18, 1:26:34 AM] <DJPheonyx> That's Commander Shepard, and Dread is his favorite game on the Citadel :P
[08/3/18, 1:27:37 AM] <shidareAKI> Red hood
[08/3/18, 1:27:40 AM] <postdataest> https://www.twitch.tv/videos/291639851 <<,. Th e most recent TM plays for me
[08/3/18, 1:29:37 AM] <shidareAKI> #ItsAFeatureNotABug
[08/3/18, 1:30:24 AM] <shidareAKI> B Dave :D
[08/3/18, 1:30:50 AM] <GeekandSundry> I love that man.
[08/3/18, 1:31:10 AM] <Chovexani> for a second I thought B Dave made a Muslim Little Pig o.o
[08/3/18, 1:31:28 AM] <shidareAKI> @geekandsundry ditto
[08/3/18, 1:32:31 AM] <Chovexani> XD a poop pit and a stinky puppy .. man
[08/3/18, 1:32:33 AM] <TheUltimateTriforce> B Dave is wonderful
[08/3/18, 1:32:48 AM] <Chovexani> oh stinky kitty
[08/3/18, 1:33:13 AM] <shidareAKI> Cat lady
[08/3/18, 1:34:28 AM] <GeekandSundry> Bonnie just writing ways for the wolf to gain access.
[08/3/18, 1:34:55 AM] <TheUltimateTriforce> If its a cat sized wolf definitely
[08/3/18, 1:34:56 AM] <DJPheonyx> Fun fact: Mark Meer was nice enough to do a quick station ad for the internet radio station for which I do my show
[08/3/18, 1:35:10 AM] <Chovexani> I love Bonnie so much she's so dang fun
[08/3/18, 1:35:11 AM] <TheUltimateTriforce> It'd be fun to see the wolf get stuck in the kitty door
[08/3/18, 1:35:12 AM] <shidareAKI> @geekandsundry just stacking Ivanâ€™s deck
[08/3/18, 1:35:33 AM] <The_TBoyce> Sheriff Sharif of Nottingham? :D
[08/3/18, 1:35:34 AM] <williamwall512> My name is Sheriff
[08/3/18, 1:35:52 AM] <shidareAKI> Omg
[08/3/18, 1:36:04 AM] <DJPheonyx> I love B. Dave... "Is he near the poop hatch?" :P
[08/3/18, 1:36:14 AM] <GeekandSundry> a lot of nominitive determinism in this town...
[08/3/18, 1:36:27 AM] <The_TBoyce> Poor Bonnie is terrified that tower will fall on her.
[08/3/18, 1:36:37 AM] <TheUltimateTriforce> B Dave is that guy
[08/3/18, 1:36:58 AM] <GeekandSundry> if the tower falls you gotta brace and turn away from the splash
[08/3/18, 1:37:01 AM] <TSparks4life> Their vol is to low
[08/3/18, 1:37:15 AM] <shidareAKI> Like. Iâ€™m terrified that Xanderâ€™s bad luck will attach itself to Bonnie. I need this to not be a Library Bards curse.
