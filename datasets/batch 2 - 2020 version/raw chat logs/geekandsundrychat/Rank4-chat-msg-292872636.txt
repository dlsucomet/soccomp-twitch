[08/3/18, 7:03:50 AM] <starpilotsix> Ender's Game was the book that single-handedly turned me from mostly reading fantasy to mostly science fiction. It's sad that the author's sort of ruined it these days.

[08/3/18, 7:07:43 AM] <starpilotsix> raman is the term for an alien that is still fundamentally comprehensible and you can interact with.

[08/3/18, 7:09:13 AM] <starpilotsix> "The difference between ramen (alien that we can interact with) and varelse (alien that we cannot meaningfully interact with and can only treat as a beast) is not in the creature judged, but in the creature judging. When we declare a species to be ramen, it does not mean that they have passed a threshold of moral maturity. It means that we have."
