[08/4/18, 6:04:15 AM] <brecreep> Were they live at Gencon this week yes?
[08/4/18, 6:04:21 AM] <Akeeba1st> Glad to have you out from under that rock @brecreep .... the real world often keeps me from staying current on things too. ;-)
[08/4/18, 6:04:45 AM] <weaponmistress> ah darn, its later? was hoping I could actually watch it live today from Germany ':D
[08/4/18, 6:04:47 AM] <brecreep> I have a full time job animating, I dont get much time for TV these days lol ironically
[08/4/18, 6:05:05 AM] <brecreep> thanks guys
[08/4/18, 6:05:08 AM] <Invoke_Aggro> I just want to know if Kyle's seen Syfy's old Eureka show and whether or not he liked it.
[08/4/18, 6:05:22 AM] <Akeeba1st> @weaponmistress Sadly, it will definitely be "tomorrow" for you folks in Germany when the show starts
[08/4/18, 6:05:46 AM] <CriticalKithri> Stay up, Weaponmistress? I'm also planning on doing that, I'm in Belgium ^^
[08/4/18, 6:05:47 AM] <brecreep> it'll be 2am here in the UK, I can stay up it's the weekend, HYPE
[08/4/18, 6:05:49 AM] <Akeeba1st> My recommendations: nap now, and set an alarm (drink some coffee to help with staying awake)
[08/4/18, 6:06:06 AM] <Nightbot> We are EMOTE ONLY mode to avoid spoilers so buckle up... this is going to be a bumpy ride.
[08/4/18, 6:06:08 AM] <weaponmistress> yeah :D at around 3 am and I ot a wedding to attend to tomorrow, so i better go to bed ><
[08/4/18, 6:06:42 AM] <FableH0und> !schedule
[08/4/18, 6:06:46 AM] <Akeeba1st> @brecreep Yep, the rock being work... is usually what keeps me away from the things I love... thank you for your work animating... animation is one of my favorite things!
[08/4/18, 6:06:49 AM] <weaponmistress> normally i would try this but I'm sure I need all my strength tomorrow
[08/4/18, 6:07:00 AM] <CriticalKithri> Oh, that's bad. I don't have anything to attend to tomorrow. But I'll stay up, setting an alarm won't just wake me up sadly

[08/4/18, 6:07:40 AM] <g_konig> question: would a tesla inspired lighting gu like we see Winston using in overwatch actually do damage?
[08/4/18, 6:07:50 AM] <Akeeba1st> @weaponmistress Dang! Nuptuals and all that... seems appropriate to not be falling asleep at a wedding...
