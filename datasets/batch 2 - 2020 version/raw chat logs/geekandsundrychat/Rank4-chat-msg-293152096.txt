[08/4/18, 10:04:47 PM] <abose360> damn... have to wait till monday then...
[08/4/18, 10:04:55 PM] <SuperGimpoMan> Everyone, if you have a crippled friend, bring them with you to an event like this. Bring some type of identification that shows that you're looking after them or whatever. The both of you will skip every line. It makes it a ton more convenient. SeemsGood
[08/4/18, 10:05:00 PM] <RJMagby> Hi

[08/4/18, 10:12:45 PM] <super390> It's a shame that the West Coasters are having to get up at 7 am to see these ladies.
[08/4/18, 10:12:50 PM] <Andyinsomnia> sound could probably use a bit of a bump up if we can @GeekandSundry

[08/4/18, 10:13:45 PM] <awkwardcassidy> @super390 To be fair us east coasters usually have to wait until past midnight to catch this live
[08/4/18, 10:14:18 PM] <super390> @awkwardcassidy I'm central time. But I want more G&S folks to get to see Lauren.
[08/4/18, 10:14:23 PM] <GeekandSundry> they are working on it... trying to avoid more audio feedback the feeds are a bit to linked
[08/4/18, 10:14:33 PM] <lucath> @supergimpoman oh good this is too good to miss
