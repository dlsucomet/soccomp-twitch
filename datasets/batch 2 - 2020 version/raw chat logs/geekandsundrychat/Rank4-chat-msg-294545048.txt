[08/8/18, 7:12:37 AM] <WelshAndyT> Logan to next Ninja?
[08/8/18, 7:12:51 AM] <TheJerseyDriver> #Reasonable
[08/8/18, 7:12:54 AM] <darkofnate> "Reasonable Approximations of Adults" should be the tagline for this channel
[08/8/18, 7:13:03 AM] <shidareAKI> @electro30006 that show is so fun. I kinda wish we could get a sequel or something
[08/8/18, 7:13:04 AM] <xxMageOfLightxx> LUL i think that lady watched Dana Carvey
[08/8/18, 7:13:11 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Fornite is coming to andoid phones, all the kids will be unproducitive in no time

[08/8/18, 7:13:55 AM] <FuffyButt> does ping pong count as a table top game
[08/8/18, 7:14:11 AM] <darkofnate> The biggest difference is that video games are harder for Becca to cheat at. Harder, but not impossible...
[08/8/18, 7:14:14 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Best of both worlds, play a tabletop video game. Ticket to ride, Talisman, D&D etc
[08/8/18, 7:14:14 AM] <WelshAndyT> FuffyButt abso bloody lootly
[08/8/18, 7:14:22 AM] <TheJerseyDriver> :D
