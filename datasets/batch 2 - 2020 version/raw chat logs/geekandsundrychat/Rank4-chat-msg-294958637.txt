[08/9/18, 8:05:13 AM] <Nightbot> Tabletop games are super fun, but learning the complicated directions and rules can be a challenge. Becca Scott is your game tutor, explaining the game mechanics in an easy to follow way, so you can get to playing the games faster. Joining her today are Kyle Hill, Josephine McAdam, Trisha Hershberger, and Josh Lee Kwai!

[08/9/18, 8:15:50 AM] <kopibrian> this year they added a lot of crazy commanders
[08/9/18, 8:15:53 AM] <SouperDumpling> How to Play is pre-taped, right? I went crazy for a hot minute seeing Trisha online on her own stream and here playing Magic
[08/9/18, 8:15:55 AM] <japenrose> @davidflegel I'd love to go one year! See all the awesome people I know in that part of the country

[08/9/18, 8:16:41 AM] <Abra107> Is that Thor? I'm not great at facial recognition, but... he looks like Thor.
[08/9/18, 8:16:48 AM] <SouperDumpling> ah I see
[08/9/18, 8:16:56 AM] <kopibrian> kyle is on every mtg media today
[08/9/18, 8:17:14 AM] <SiegeofTeddyBears> It's Thor when he's not channeling the Odin Force.
[08/9/18, 8:17:20 AM] <shidareAKI> I remember when my friends would tap their cards and only kind of slant them to the side. Did they make it a rule that you have to fully turn them on their side?
