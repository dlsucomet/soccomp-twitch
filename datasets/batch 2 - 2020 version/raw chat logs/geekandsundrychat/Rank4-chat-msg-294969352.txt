[08/9/18, 12:42:14 PM] <Nightbot> There are no grills in the studio. There are girls, although they usually prefer to be called skull crushing immortals. If you are seeing grills where none exist, you should see a doctor. However, Ryan did put a grill in the back of the studio for when he wants to cook vegetable fajitas so that one is okay.
