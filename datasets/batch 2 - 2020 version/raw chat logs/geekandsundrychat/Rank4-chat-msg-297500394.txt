[08/15/18, 7:22:18 AM] <jimmy_eat_meatloaf> truth be told, Madden looks awesome.
[08/15/18, 7:22:23 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Can the internet get angry about dogs in their madden sports games or do they not care about historical accuracy ;)
[08/15/18, 7:22:39 AM] <cinphoria> @Gibfist Again, this is the entire premise of the show. I'm sorry it's not to your taste, but if you continue to do nothing but disparage it you might want to justl eave.
[08/15/18, 7:22:50 AM] <Zismarith> I'm pretty sure the answer is "yes." @EricaTheStrange
