[08/16/18, 12:43:16 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> intro and element picks so far\
[08/16/18, 12:43:17 PM] <glshade1> Both were pretty bad for me @deathstar_taco
[08/16/18, 12:43:19 PM] <shidareAKI> This game is so cool. Js. The fact that you can scan cards into a phone or iPad is technologically brilliant.

[08/16/18, 12:45:18 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> @Paladin356 how so?
[08/16/18, 12:45:22 PM] <MonocleSociety> @BlackLionoftheStars We feel ya. Can't believe how fast the game has grown, but we'll just keep making it better until you get your copy.
[08/16/18, 12:45:24 PM] <Paladin356> vexelghost maybe once i finish Parks and Rec, ill watch
[08/16/18, 12:45:25 PM] <shidareAKI> @paladin356 the design of the cards is actually pretty removed from your typical tarot set. They don‚Äôt feel like tarot cards.
[08/16/18, 12:45:34 PM] <Zismarith> @CosmicVoyagerX Love/Heart?
[08/16/18, 12:45:49 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> @MonocleSociety totally looking forward to it :) cheers!
[08/16/18, 12:45:51 PM] <Paladin356> shidareAKI it seems like they're not referring to it as a Tarot deck anymore too
[08/16/18, 12:45:55 PM] <Mandid101> This is the first time I‚Äôve seen this, and it looks very very interesting
[08/16/18, 12:46:00 PM] <Paladin356> BlackLionoftheStars its more of a personal thing.

[08/16/18, 12:46:32 PM] <mixyourfeelings> :)
[08/16/18, 12:46:38 PM] <shidareAKI> Well 1) the cards are tarot themed. 2) there are two decks and one is not tarot related at all
[08/16/18, 12:46:40 PM] <Paladin356> is this becoming Pitch Perfect?
[08/16/18, 12:46:40 PM] <BlackLionoftheStars> 6th
