[08/17/18, 11:52:55 AM] <fondledondles> I gotta go, is there a way to get a timestamp to see how far in we are? Anybody know a trick?
[08/17/18, 11:52:55 AM] <vorpoler> Just a reminder to everyone, Taliesin doesn't know any of this either. He said on talks he's just as much in the dark about Lucien's history as Molly was
[08/17/18, 11:52:57 AM] <kerotan87> Theory! yasha was a secret member of mollys past
[08/17/18, 11:52:59 AM] <delennjadzia> Tal's so excited awwwwww

[08/17/18, 11:53:06 AM] <ganymede425> I'm thinking Molly is more of a Nameless One type situation, where he's died and come back with different personas several times.
[08/17/18, 11:53:08 AM] <TheLostGeographer> Hello guys!
[08/17/18, 11:53:09 AM] <MoonlightViolet> Molly cult leader confirmed?

[08/17/18, 11:53:17 AM] <Kingdomfiend> The difference is though Tal cast decompose on Mollys body. So maybe he cant ressurect again
