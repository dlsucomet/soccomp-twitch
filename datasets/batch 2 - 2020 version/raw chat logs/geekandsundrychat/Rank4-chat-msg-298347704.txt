[08/17/18, 7:03:33 AM] <iampuddleglum> the audio was weird at the start, but it's better for me now

[08/17/18, 7:04:29 AM] <Zismarith> Strength fitness can be geeky. Cosplaying Worf is probably easier if you've got shoulders.
[08/17/18, 7:05:09 AM] <MaxMoneyAWA> Wow! A brick shit-house ain't got nothing on him
[08/17/18, 7:05:20 AM] <InventoryFullPT> Just wait

[08/17/18, 7:05:31 AM] <dayntee> One of the Math teachers I had in Jr. High was a strength athelete. I think he was, at the time, officially the 3rd strongest man in the world?
[08/17/18, 7:05:39 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Leigh574

[08/17/18, 7:05:58 AM] <red_topaz> Is this the same as being a powerlifter? That sounds like what he's describing.

[08/17/18, 7:07:08 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Erika is tiny and Swole and is a living version of the star from super mario

[08/17/18, 7:07:46 AM] <super390> this feels like an optical illusion room.
[08/17/18, 7:07:46 AM] <dayntee> daynteWtf

[08/17/18, 7:07:59 AM] <Zismarith> I'm not a small person, but I think I'm barely one of his legs.
[08/17/18, 7:07:59 AM] <Yamifira> looks like sbd is sitting in undies
[08/17/18, 7:08:03 AM] <chaoticloony> No wonder they have supports under the couch!
[08/17/18, 7:08:12 AM] <dayntee> Not sure that couch could take that muscle density, @EricaTheStrange
[08/17/18, 7:08:13 AM] <MaxMoneyAWA> I'd love to see Willingblam with these two :D
[08/17/18, 7:08:39 AM] <EricaTheStrange> ah yes, G&S has killed a few couches in the past @dayntee
[08/17/18, 7:08:45 AM] <red_topaz> I'm so stoked G&S had powerlifters on! I just subbed and they instantly have a show talking about my sport. Feels like fate.
[08/17/18, 7:09:03 AM] <dayntee> Awesome, @red_topaz

[08/17/18, 7:18:51 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Ouch. >.<
[08/17/18, 7:19:26 AM] <1uniqueBeast> Strength training is a resource management game.

[08/17/18, 7:20:48 AM] <EclecticSoundwaveSophist> so what's better on bed , brains aside, a weight lifter or marathon runner?
[08/17/18, 7:21:39 AM] <UsualPlumbot> Looking at this interview is like watching WOW characters talk to NPC's. In the difference in the models
[08/17/18, 7:21:54 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> my brother did a pinky guitar exercise obsessively and developed a huge muscle on the pinkie side of his left hand
