[08/24/18, 7:07:14 AM] <Miner49r10> I'm 18, but I watched a bunch of episodes of Batman the Animated Series a couple years ago
[08/24/18, 7:07:19 AM] <ArisBranwin> I watched the entire series when I came home from school. Sailor Moon, Ronin Warriors, and then Batman the animated series.. then DBZ.
[08/24/18, 7:07:19 AM] <DarkestArgentum> the 92 batman show came out when i was in a REALLY dark place it the animated X men and 2 spesific comics were a big help to me at the time
[08/24/18, 7:08:22 AM] <Leigh574> i loved Super Friends
[08/24/18, 7:08:24 AM] <Ossborn> In 1992 I was 16...
[08/24/18, 7:08:26 AM] <ArisBranwin> Yeah and Batman the animated series led to Superman cartoon and then the Justice League..
[08/24/18, 7:08:29 AM] <nhlfan44> Phantasm is my favorite BTAS villain
[08/24/18, 7:08:30 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> 1966 was the original show
[08/24/18, 7:08:34 AM] <chaoticloony> Super Friends was so great
[08/24/18, 7:08:37 AM] <Zismarith> Oh wow.
[08/24/18, 7:08:49 AM] <ArisBranwin> "Battle of the Superfriends.."
[08/24/18, 7:08:57 AM] <Leigh574> @Ossborn I was 17, just graduating high school
[08/24/18, 7:09:16 AM] <DarkestArgentum> there was a great episode of batman the brave and the bold when they had Adam west playing Bruce's dad and Kevin Conroy as the phantom stranger so they had the 3 best tv batmen all in the same episode
[08/24/18, 7:09:33 AM] <Zismarith> My first Batman was a cameo on Scooby-Doo. I think it was in 1731 or so.
[08/24/18, 7:09:35 AM] <chaoticloony> @Ossborn I was 22 in 1992
[08/24/18, 7:09:43 AM] <KibbleDaddy> Jolly gee willllikers Batman!!!

[08/24/18, 7:11:40 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Terry was a pretty great Batman, too.
[08/24/18, 7:11:45 AM] <Grimswerth> What was the cartoon with the young batman?
[08/24/18, 7:11:58 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @ArisBranwin batman beyond was INSANLY dark for a kids show that aired on saturday mornings
[08/24/18, 7:12:43 AM] <Neutral_President> The Dark knight returns looks like a troll in the comic
[08/24/18, 7:13:37 AM] <ArisBranwin> It wasnt that dark
[08/24/18, 7:13:59 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @Grimswerth that was batman beyond it had a teenager being trianed to be the new batman by an elderly bruce wayne (then we find out amanda waller aranged for terry to be biologicly bruces son)
[08/24/18, 7:14:31 AM] <Grimswerth> @w_nightstone oh I think I saw some of that one
[08/24/18, 7:14:37 AM] <ArisBranwin> But it was pretty interesting and explained a later on Batman..
[08/24/18, 7:15:35 AM] <DarkestArgentum> it was REALLY dark there was a street gang that worshiped joker batman (bruce) nealry uses a gun to shot a person drucg dealers bioterrorisum and body moding are issues he has to deal with
