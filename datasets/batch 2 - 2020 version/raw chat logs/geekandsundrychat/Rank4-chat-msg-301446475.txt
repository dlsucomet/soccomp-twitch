[08/25/18, 7:02:11 AM] <CureJewel2017> I'm excited to see this live! I missed the first episode.....
[08/25/18, 7:02:17 AM] <shidareAKI> @nomlicious none of that is up to me! It’s 100% up to the production team.
[08/25/18, 7:02:19 AM] <JeffM0307> !notdnd
[08/25/18, 7:02:19 AM] <Nightbot> Twitch doesn't have a generic RPG tag, so all RPGs get identified as D&D. It is a limitation of the platform.
[08/25/18, 7:02:36 AM] <phoenixmelody> I'm so excited to see them try and figure out their super powers! Training Montage!!!!
