[08/25/18, 7:05:57 AM] <Nightbot> Twitch doesn't have a generic RPG tag, so all RPGs get identified as D&D. It is a limitation of the platform.
[08/25/18, 7:05:57 AM] <deleyna> @GardenOfEdenya I'm with you. Same happened to me.
[08/25/18, 7:06:02 AM] <tatzelthess> made it just in time! woo!
[08/25/18, 7:06:07 AM] <Noctra> think hector was in another game that ran late.

[08/25/18, 7:06:18 AM] <sunlitlake> 2 bucks says everyone is just staring at th fanart and is too busy admiring it to realise they need to go live

[08/25/18, 7:06:31 AM] <FuffyButt> !section32
[08/25/18, 7:06:31 AM] <Nightbot> Section 32 is one more than Section 31 and therefore is not <message deleted>.
[08/25/18, 7:06:31 AM] <Slippydude> 10 mins late, hope everything is okay
[08/25/18, 7:06:37 AM] <Thermitelogic> ah I see. I'll stick around and check it out. tabletop RPGs are awesome in general.
[08/25/18, 7:06:38 AM] <misroi> I'd buy that, @sunlitlake .
[08/25/18, 7:06:41 AM] <Meithar> Unless it is Numenera. It has it's own rpg tag.
[08/25/18, 7:06:41 AM] <Thermitelogic> ty all for the info
[08/25/18, 7:06:43 AM] <philbe63> Mathilde_draws is the new awesome!

[08/25/18, 7:06:52 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @sunlitlake everyone is too profesh to do that
[08/25/18, 7:06:52 AM] <DANfan69> Its so odd how much Sams character looks like Erika Ishii
[08/25/18, 7:06:53 AM] <strous1> Late start later ending. :)

[08/25/18, 7:06:54 AM] <Nightbot> We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. Uh, how are you?
[08/25/18, 7:06:54 AM] <BeJondBelief> I just want to find out how the charcter progression works in this system. They all had 2 XP to bank or spend after the first ep
[08/25/18, 7:06:56 AM] <ChewieMP> i am ready for Hector to hear the joke "Why the long face?" CONSTANTLY
[08/25/18, 7:07:12 AM] <Slippydude> @shidareAKI that's a silly limitation that Twitch should have fixed by now.
[08/25/18, 7:07:17 AM] <potterboi111> what is the rules for rolling like
[08/25/18, 7:07:22 AM] <Slippydude> @shidareAKI thats good to hear
[08/25/18, 7:07:22 AM] <phoenixmelody> @sunlitlake I totally agree. Amy would totally get distracted by the art
[08/25/18, 7:07:24 AM] <DANfan69> How am I doing on Hawaii?
[08/25/18, 7:07:29 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @ChewieMP or "way to really stick your neck out there"
[08/25/18, 7:07:31 AM] <DANfan69> !itsfine
[08/25/18, 7:07:31 AM] <FuffyButt> is this a good time to Panic?
[08/25/18, 7:07:33 AM] <shidareAKI> @slippydude I think that an upcoming update will actually fix it.
[08/25/18, 7:07:40 AM] <tatzelthess> eee! my fanart made it into the reel! *swoons*
[08/25/18, 7:07:41 AM] <Nemisar> did we ever get an answer is is schway or shway? or some other way to spell it
[08/25/18, 7:07:45 AM] <Thermitelogic> I just started watching Shield of Tomorrow this morning and I can't believe I haven't bothered to watch it prior. first episode was so good.
[08/25/18, 7:07:45 AM] <Nemisar> is it*
[08/25/18, 7:07:47 AM] <tealbrigade> so much incredible fanart before the second episode even airs, this community is incredible
[08/25/18, 7:07:48 AM] <MonteCookGames> Here it comes!
[08/25/18, 7:07:50 AM] <Ariaflame> Cypher system. Have to roll more than 3 times difficulty
[08/25/18, 7:07:54 AM] <Nemisar> GET READY!
[08/25/18, 7:07:55 AM] <Noctra> @chewiemp I am almost deading it as much as I am looking forward to it..
[08/25/18, 7:07:55 AM] <ChewieMP> pick your jaw up off the floor
[08/25/18, 7:08:01 AM] <darkofnate> @FuffyButt It's never a bad time to panic
[08/25/18, 7:08:01 AM] <potterboi111> is it a d20 system
[08/25/18, 7:08:03 AM] <BeJondBelief> @potterboi111 GM decides a diff level and its 3* level DC on a d20
[08/25/18, 7:08:04 AM] <RealMicah> Thessur's art should be on the cover of a Callisto 6 comic.
[08/25/18, 7:08:06 AM] <kaizen_avz> what is going on?
[08/25/18, 7:08:08 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @WOMS It's the first one.
[08/25/18, 7:08:10 AM] <phoenixmelody> @DANfan69 We got you! We're here for you!
[08/25/18, 7:08:11 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> @WOMS On Batman Beyond it was schway.
[08/25/18, 7:08:12 AM] <Ariaflame> D20 yes

[08/25/18, 7:08:15 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @woms schway. or at least that's how we used to spell it when it was actually used
[08/25/18, 7:08:18 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I think September is when Twitch is supposed to have new TTRPG tags
[08/25/18, 7:08:23 AM] <Nemisar> makes sense, thanks! :D
[08/25/18, 7:08:24 AM] <ChewieMP> the pun ammo is all there
[08/25/18, 7:08:30 AM] <MonteCookGames> There's a free rules primer on the Cypher System on the main page of Your Best Game Ever! Check it out :-) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/montecookgames/your-best-game-ever
[08/25/18, 7:08:31 AM] <Slippydude> @shidareAKI I imagine they could have added in the required strings, image files and additional option ages ago though
[08/25/18, 7:08:31 AM] <DANfan69> Thank you all
[08/25/18, 7:08:33 AM] <KBTibbs> Hello folks
[08/25/18, 7:08:33 AM] <chaoticloony> @potterboi111 Each challenge number = 3 and you need to roll higher that the target, but some things will change the target
[08/25/18, 7:08:35 AM] <misroi> @potterboi111 IIRC, the GM sets a difficulty of 1 - 10, and the players can modify it with advantages or whatever. Once they've modified it as much as they wish, they roll a d20 against 3x the final difficulty. Meet or beat to succeed.
[08/25/18, 7:08:36 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @thermitelogic if you like tgat watch Eric's Tbd rpg
[08/25/18, 7:08:39 AM] <kynaeus2> no no it's too early for sam puns!
[08/25/18, 7:08:40 AM] <DsnyPixChck> I can’t wait for this! I love Lacy and I’m super excited to see what Sam does with the character.
[08/25/18, 7:08:44 AM] <AtmaPrime> Believe that it's 'schway,' not seen it spelled elsewise
[08/25/18, 7:08:45 AM] <potterboi111> its like the strange by monty then
[08/25/18, 7:08:51 AM] <aleph_sharp> I dont think Ill be able to watch anynore
