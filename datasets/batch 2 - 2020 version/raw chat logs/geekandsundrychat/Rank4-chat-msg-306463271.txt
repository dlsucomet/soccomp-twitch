[09/6/18, 10:06:53 AM] <chaoticloony> @TheBobHatter Welcome and enjoy!
[09/6/18, 10:06:54 AM] <TheBobHatter> I just did 2 months, does that make me still a newbie?
[09/6/18, 10:06:59 AM] <little1liz> i haven't been able to finish an issue of deadpool. my friends say there is something wrong with me
[09/6/18, 10:07:13 AM] <AromiaFlyce> OMG Did Tal just SQUEAK??
[09/6/18, 10:07:16 AM] <japenrose> @giljaxon Hope your day gets better and tomorrow even better!
[09/6/18, 10:07:18 AM] <That_One_Guy212> deadpool lost what made him funny recently
[09/6/18, 10:07:25 AM] <KaiOrAya> The calendar is very confusing and I've resigned myself to putting in pre-orders/subscriptions then being surprised when it appears
[09/6/18, 10:07:26 AM] <Flight_Devil> Different strokes for different folks. @little1liz
[09/6/18, 10:07:31 AM] <giljaxon> @japenrose thank you
[09/6/18, 10:07:36 AM] <misssunflower94> @AromiaFlyce Tal squeaks are best squeaks
[09/6/18, 10:07:49 AM] <AromiaFlyce> @misssunflower94 true!
[09/6/18, 10:07:51 AM] <morgan_forester> I still don’t get deadpool
[09/6/18, 10:07:55 AM] <Baloneyes> on a tangential note, I'm curious as to who picks up Gwenpool after Hastings
[09/6/18, 10:08:05 AM] <achancham> QUESTION: A comic book character must create a world wide party that everyone can participate in. Who is it and what theme do they pick?
[09/6/18, 10:08:17 AM] <Flight_Devil> If there's anything wrong with Deadpool, it's that he hasn't faced a mutant chimichanga monster.
[09/6/18, 10:08:45 AM] <owifig> I feel like this is all preamble to Amy's standard "So! Who is Gerry Duggan?" Except he's RIGHT THERE so I don't know how that works.
[09/6/18, 10:08:56 AM] <phoenixgoth> @misssunflower94 Tal squeaks are indeed the best squeaks <3
[09/6/18, 10:09:06 AM] <cinphoria> Elcor: Earnest compliment: etc etc
[09/6/18, 10:09:06 AM] <KyHawkeye> hawkeye? I could get into that... lol
[09/6/18, 10:09:18 AM] <achancham> @Flight_Devil I think it would end up similar to when Shaggy and Scooby faced the Cotton Candy monster : )
[09/6/18, 10:09:20 AM] <darkhalfelf284> I only just popped in. Can anyone let me know who the special guest is?
[09/6/18, 10:09:20 AM] <merc_birb> <3 Hawkeye
[09/6/18, 10:09:21 AM] <g0rmyr> @KyHawkeye lol

[09/6/18, 10:09:38 AM] <That_One_Guy212> deadpool during dark reign and x-force was amazing
[09/6/18, 10:09:48 AM] <Flight_Devil> @achancham Assuming Deadpool can eat a two story monster. :D
[09/6/18, 10:09:49 AM] <AromiaFlyce> lmaoooooo the word-play with this group kills me

[09/6/18, 10:10:40 AM] <misssunflower94> I miss my teal hair so much it kills me
[09/6/18, 10:10:51 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @morgan_forester go pink, nothing is more grunge than pink hair
[09/6/18, 10:11:02 AM] <philbe63> I put in red roots today...Still have purple and blue (though the blue's faded a bit)

[09/6/18, 10:11:35 AM] <IamJesterfest> @justhere4coffee Deadpool leading a Tbolts type team of d-list villains would be great.
