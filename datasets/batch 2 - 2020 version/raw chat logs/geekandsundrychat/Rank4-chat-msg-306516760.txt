[09/6/18, 10:08:05 AM] <achancham> QUESTION: A comic book character must create a world wide party that everyone can participate in. Who is it and what theme do they pick?
[09/6/18, 10:08:17 AM] <Flight_Devil> If there's anything wrong with Deadpool, it's that he hasn't faced a mutant chimichanga monster.
[09/6/18, 10:08:45 AM] <owifig> I feel like this is all preamble to Amy's standard "So! Who is Gerry Duggan?" Except he's RIGHT THERE so I don't know how that works.
