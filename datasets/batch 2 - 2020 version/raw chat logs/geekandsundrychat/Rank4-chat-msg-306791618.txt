[09/7/18, 7:02:50 AM] <Zismarith> This show does tend to be light on screaming. Guess she wanted to make up for it all in one go.

[09/7/18, 7:03:28 AM] <LordDarkhan> Oh hell yes. I am here for the right episode!
[09/7/18, 7:03:31 AM] <KBTibbs> Oh.. Dresdin Files. They're good books, but they feel... slimy.
[09/7/18, 7:03:59 AM] <Critternation3000> i feel like i should read Dresdin files but there's sooo many
[09/7/18, 7:04:07 AM] <Nightbot> Download the new Critical Role theme song for Campaign Two! http://itunes.apple.com/album/id1331550250?ls=1&app=itunes Sales of the song support the musician, Jason Charles Miller.
[09/7/18, 7:04:09 AM] <LordDarkhan> Michael is literally the only paladin-archetype character in any medium that I love
[09/7/18, 7:04:19 AM] <RuzgofDI> Does Ryan even own a t-shirt?
[09/7/18, 7:04:30 AM] <LordDarkhan> omg... where did she get that shirt?
[09/7/18, 7:04:51 AM] <darkofnate> Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean there isn't an invisible demon about to bite your face off...
[09/7/18, 7:05:01 AM] <ShatnerToupee> As a Weird Al and Schmenge Brothers fan, I approve of that shirt
[09/7/18, 7:05:13 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Dresden is the king of snark
[09/7/18, 7:05:24 AM] <korbin_orion> only my second episode I've ever watched, and I get so lucky to come in on the Dresden Files episode.
[09/7/18, 7:06:11 AM] <darkofnate> My favorite opening line to a book EVER: "The building was on fire and it WASN'T my fault."
[09/7/18, 7:06:15 AM] <chaoticloony> @korbin_orion Great second episode
[09/7/18, 7:06:15 AM] <RuzgofDI> I know the World Builder's Charity store has in the past had a Polka Never Dies t-shirt. Although it may be a bit spoilery for those not caught up.
[09/7/18, 7:06:51 AM] <KBTibbs> The last Dresden book I read was Grave Peril. I liked so much of it, but there were 10 named women characters. 7 of the 10 of them received at least a paragraph describing their breasts. I counted. Ugh Jim Butcher... WHY?
[09/7/18, 7:07:28 AM] <Steemdroid> i love the books and the tv show was cool
[09/7/18, 7:08:06 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @kbtibbs Keep reading, Jim improves, Harry is a cheuvanist
[09/7/18, 7:08:17 AM] <chaoticloony> Off topic on this show, That NEVER happens! :)
[09/7/18, 7:08:42 AM] <Zismarith> A lot of people use "actor" as a generic term, non-gender.
[09/7/18, 7:08:44 AM] <KBTibbs> @ShandraVdeG Harry is, but it's gross
[09/7/18, 7:09:23 AM] <Terridor> What time does Critical Role start this wekk?
[09/7/18, 7:09:24 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @kbtibbs he's a bit of a jerk yes

[09/7/18, 7:11:16 AM] <shidareAKI> @BlackMemberAC nothing to that effect has been announced but if you're interested in something like that, you should tweet them about it.
[09/7/18, 7:11:18 AM] <BlackMemberAC> anyone?
[09/7/18, 7:11:29 AM] <JeffM0307> @BlackMemberAC I don't think so

[09/7/18, 7:11:51 AM] <shidareAKI> They've only announced NYCC and MCM
[09/7/18, 7:11:53 AM] <BlackMemberAC> @jeffm0307 thanks
[09/7/18, 7:12:08 AM] <theSp3ctr3> ooooo Dresden Files Dresden??!?!? awesome
[09/7/18, 7:12:16 AM] <theSp3ctr3> i just started reading these ...on book 3
[09/7/18, 7:12:32 AM] <BlackMemberAC> I thought so, I was hoping but I didn't think they would come this far south
[09/7/18, 7:12:43 AM] <Captain_byrd> man they need to have her guest star on crit role
[09/7/18, 7:13:11 AM] <theSp3ctr3> Becca Scott should be on all the shows!!!
[09/7/18, 7:13:26 AM] <theSp3ctr3> loved the Magic series she just hosted
[09/7/18, 7:13:26 AM] <JiveMTL> I support this
[09/7/18, 7:14:03 AM] <theSp3ctr3> ok i gtg...i dont want spoilers i really like these books thus far
[09/7/18, 7:14:09 AM] <chaoticloony> @theSp3ctr3 Do you watch her Game the Game videos on YouTube?
[09/7/18, 7:14:24 AM] <camodikk> they are stellar book series
[09/7/18, 7:14:30 AM] <theSp3ctr3> i watch them on youtube or on alpha @chaoticloony
[09/7/18, 7:14:31 AM] <Captain_byrd> I'm not saying she should replace Ashley but they seem to have similar qualities
[09/7/18, 7:14:51 AM] <theSp3ctr3> (yeah...i sub here and project alpha!!)
[09/7/18, 7:15:11 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Again, Highly recommend starting with book 7. Author wrote it as secondary starting point, since his writing skills improved so much since book one.
[09/7/18, 7:15:25 AM] <LogicCore> LOREMASTERS ABOUT HARRY DRESDEN!? logiccFbomb YES!
[09/7/18, 7:15:44 AM] <theSp3ctr3> they should springboard this into a one shot TTRPG play of Dresden files RPG
[09/7/18, 7:16:05 AM] <LogicCore> Hell yeah
[09/7/18, 7:16:10 AM] <LordDarkhan> @ShandraVdeG I get why you'd say that, but I'd still recommend starting from the beginning
[09/7/18, 7:16:16 AM] <reddirttabletop> is it live
[09/7/18, 7:16:22 AM] <LordDarkhan> I just got sucked into the series like no other series I've read
[09/7/18, 7:16:22 AM] <Renoxius> is the audio pretty quiet or is it just me?
[09/7/18, 7:16:23 AM] <JeffM0307> @reddirttabletop Yes
[09/7/18, 7:16:29 AM] <Andyinsomnia> yes this is live
[09/7/18, 7:16:36 AM] <DarknessMuta> yeah audio is real low
[09/7/18, 7:16:45 AM] <chaoticloony> @theSp3ctr3 I seen talk about people wanting to see a Dresden Files RPG show all over the place
[09/7/18, 7:16:52 AM] <KBTibbs> I really liked in the show it was a drumstick and a hockey stick
[09/7/18, 7:16:57 AM] <Captain_byrd> you say I could start at Dresden book 7?
[09/7/18, 7:17:01 AM] <ShandraVdeG> @lorddarkhan I've known too many folks who get suck on books 1, 2 or 3 because Jim is still only fair to middling skillswise.
[09/7/18, 7:17:26 AM] <theSp3ctr3> @chaoticloony i actually started reading the books because i saw the dresden RPG books and thought i should read the series before getting the book
[09/7/18, 7:17:30 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Read 7, then go back and read 1 if you like it
[09/7/18, 7:17:42 AM] <nickraska> Dresden is my jam
[09/7/18, 7:17:48 AM] <reddirttabletop> can we see her tat? or no
[09/7/18, 7:17:50 AM] <theSp3ctr3> (getting the RPG book)
[09/7/18, 7:17:57 AM] <ArisBranwin> Never got into it.. its just not for me.
[09/7/18, 7:18:03 AM] <alphapup1> Has anyone played the RPG?
