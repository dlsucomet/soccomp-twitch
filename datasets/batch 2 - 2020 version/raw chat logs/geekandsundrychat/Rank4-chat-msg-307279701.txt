[09/8/18, 7:06:46 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> VAST was VASTLY ambitious
[09/8/18, 7:07:08 AM] <Shadowsoflife> heh
[09/8/18, 7:07:25 AM] <japenrose> Cake math!
[09/8/18, 7:07:29 AM] <KBTibbs> Oh, Hector has optimized the funnel cakes
[09/8/18, 7:07:42 AM] <ArisBranwin> They did the math science
[09/8/18, 7:07:43 AM] <EQWashu> cake math best math
[09/8/18, 7:07:45 AM] <japenrose> Triple up on the plates
[09/8/18, 7:07:47 AM] <CMDRData> this is an amazing start
[09/8/18, 7:07:48 AM] <DANfan69> All men are not created equal, Samoa Joe, you only have a 33 and a 3rd percent chance of winning
[09/8/18, 7:07:52 AM] <EricaTheStrange> What kind of paper though?
[09/8/18, 7:07:53 AM] <Dasbif> #cakes
[09/8/18, 7:07:53 AM] <shidareAKI> VAST was the best <3
[09/8/18, 7:07:54 AM] <UselessRogue> hector brings out the autocad layout
[09/8/18, 7:07:57 AM] <Glistam> Taking care of the most important things.\
[09/8/18, 7:08:03 AM] <ArisBranwin> The science of funnel cakes.
[09/8/18, 7:08:06 AM] <FuffyButt> funnel cake math
[09/8/18, 7:08:18 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> part of me wants to believe only a Corpie would min/max the funnel cake, but it IS 2119
[09/8/18, 7:08:23 AM] <bookity101> still hoping for the vast epilouge to show up on youtube...
[09/8/18, 7:08:26 AM] <DANfan69> Funnel Cakes and Cream Soda for all
[09/8/18, 7:08:46 AM] <KBTibbs> In true X-men style... mundane event gets crashed with an emergency
[09/8/18, 7:09:21 AM] <shidareAKI> If all of you need context for the damage a 6.0 earth quake can inflict, Hokkaido had a 6.7 (7) the other day. It's pretty bad.
[09/8/18, 7:09:48 AM] <Dasbif> @KBTibbs i'm picturing the football game interrupted by the earthquake guy in X-Men Evolution... :D
[09/8/18, 7:10:02 AM] <Dasbif> Avalanche? was that his name?
[09/8/18, 7:10:06 AM] <Hertzorciphers> thoughts to northern japanese
[09/8/18, 7:10:07 AM] <misroi> Also, the Richter scale is logarithmic, so a 6.0 is roughly ten times worse than a 5.0.
[09/8/18, 7:10:10 AM] <japenrose> @shidareAKI Oh jeez, how did that not make the news here?! I hope people are okay!
[09/8/18, 7:10:12 AM] <Shadowsoflife> Yea
[09/8/18, 7:10:21 AM] <misroi> Also, hey folks!
[09/8/18, 7:10:34 AM] <WelshAndyT> Dasbif yes, real name, Lance Alvers
[09/8/18, 7:10:38 AM] <EQWashu> Happy Friday @misroi teenHEY
[09/8/18, 7:10:40 AM] <DANfan69> @shindareAKI I'm headed to Japan next week, pray for those and I hope I'm safe there
[09/8/18, 7:11:07 AM] <Hertzorciphers> @japenrose : last week, japan has been hit by a massive storm (Jebi) and then an 6.7 earthquake... on the same week
[09/8/18, 7:11:08 AM] <SpoopySkeletor> did i miss anything?
[09/8/18, 7:11:12 AM] <HectorIsFunny> Hector get off your phone
[09/8/18, 7:11:13 AM] <Glistam> Gigavolts, not Gigawats?
[09/8/18, 7:11:16 AM] <shidareAKI> @japenrose earthquakes happen here all the time, so maybe some people feel it's not news?
