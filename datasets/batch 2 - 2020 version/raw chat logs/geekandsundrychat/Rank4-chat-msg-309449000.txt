[09/13/18, 10:02:25 AM] <KaiOrAya> I bet Gina could fix the couch. It might involve hotglue but I bet she could
[09/13/18, 10:02:28 AM] <cinphoria> That means you would never be in charge, Taliesin :P

[09/13/18, 10:02:55 AM] <KaiOrAya> @KBTibbs I am! Sometimes my brain scrambles audio and text helps
[09/13/18, 10:02:59 AM] <shidareAKI> I think the reason Tal is immortal is specifically because he doesn't sleep.

[09/13/18, 10:06:45 AM] <jessieleaf> gonna stay out of chat tonight, need to finish up some work. See all of you wonderful people!
[09/13/18, 10:06:52 AM] <TheLostGeographer> Wow I have often followed the artists, which is kinda oposite
[09/13/18, 10:06:56 AM] <japenrose> Good luck @jessieleaf !
[09/13/18, 10:06:58 AM] <JeffM0307> Later @jessieleaf
[09/13/18, 10:07:00 AM] <misssunflower94> yeah see the thing about comics is that because it's so visual if I can't get into the art style I will not read it
[09/13/18, 10:07:06 AM] <RMutt1917> @jessieleaf Happy doogLurk

[09/13/18, 10:07:32 AM] <shidareAKI> let's get this ball rolling
[09/13/18, 10:07:39 AM] <jessieleaf> Thanks ya'll! catch you all later!
[09/13/18, 10:07:51 AM] <SolaeXIII> I'm new to comics so don't know who this person is. I will go check it out while they talk!
[09/13/18, 10:07:58 AM] <101deadpool1017> Wait...people thought girls weren't suppose to draw?...?
[09/13/18, 10:07:59 AM] <misssunflower94> later @jessieleaf
[09/13/18, 10:08:01 AM] <crthemighty> see, in my family, the girls are the ones who actually can draw :D
[09/13/18, 10:08:06 AM] <KaiOrAya> psssh. Girls have always been doing art. We just occasionally blow off their work and call it crafts
[09/13/18, 10:08:09 AM] <japenrose> @101deadpool1017 Yeah, I'm in shock about that too!
[09/13/18, 10:08:10 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> See ya later, @jessieleaf !
[09/13/18, 10:08:16 AM] <KBTibbs> Is that the Enterprise D on Amy's hoodie?
[09/13/18, 10:08:17 AM] <souzo_> @misssunflower94 Yeah, that affects me too. When I first tried to read Watchmen, I put it down after a few pages. I was too young to appreciate the material at that age.
[09/13/18, 10:08:17 AM] <misssunflower94> Girls arent' supposed to draw? gee no one told me
[09/13/18, 10:08:38 AM] <FuffyButt> who said girls cant draw? lets go beat them up
[09/13/18, 10:08:41 AM] <ArisBranwin> Cue Madonnas "Do you know what it feels like for a girl."
[09/13/18, 10:08:44 AM] <MeggieMay328> girls were suppose to get married. They only were suppose to go to college to get a husband (that last part I wasn't aware of but have heard from older women since I was young)
[09/13/18, 10:08:44 AM] <giljaxon> then i was supposed to transfer there but couldn’t get the classes for the credits. broke my heart and made me quit art for 2 decades
[09/13/18, 10:08:44 AM] <RMutt1917> @SolaeXIII a lot of long time comic readers are also unaware of her
[09/13/18, 10:09:00 AM] <KaiOrAya> @101deadpool1017 For a long time women were taught to draw to be marketable as a wife but it was supposed to be a hobby like with music and conversation
[09/13/18, 10:09:00 AM] <Dreavel> Kappa Kappa
[09/13/18, 10:09:01 AM] <cartoonwomen> @misssunflower94 girls are supposed to draw, they're just not going to get paid for it
[09/13/18, 10:09:03 AM] <MeggieMay328> and these aren't that old of women - baby boomers
[09/13/18, 10:09:21 AM] <101deadpool1017> @kaioraya That makes sense

[09/13/18, 10:09:51 AM] <shidareAKI> THIS JUST IN: Societal gender "rules" are bullshit! Gender roles in general are bullshit. Ignore them! Throw them right out of the window.

[09/13/18, 10:10:00 AM] <KaiOrAya> @101deadpool1017 Yeah. It goes back to...I think at least the 16th century in Europe. My Asian cultural norms history is a bit fuzzier
[09/13/18, 10:10:03 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: how do get into the writing of a comic if the art doesn't grab you right away?
[09/13/18, 10:10:10 AM] <RealMicah> Right on, @shidareAKI !
[09/13/18, 10:10:14 AM] <tortugadelmar> @shidareAKI seconded

[09/13/18, 10:10:53 AM] <101deadpool1017> @kaioraya Interesting, I heard about the music and conversation part, the art and drawing was new for me.

[09/13/18, 10:11:47 AM] <japenrose> @misssunflower94 You know, thats a really interesting question. I wonder if it differs for folks who were more exposed to novels before picture based works in their childhood.
[09/13/18, 10:11:48 AM] <super390> Warrior being fawned over by two women.
