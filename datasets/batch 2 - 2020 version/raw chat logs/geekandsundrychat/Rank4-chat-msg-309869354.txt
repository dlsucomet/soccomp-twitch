[09/14/18, 7:03:46 AM] <cinphoria> Ryan has at least 3 simulacra of himself
[09/14/18, 7:03:58 AM] <KBTibbs> @HydroSnail_RyanGreen Naw, that's cool. Two of you is nice.
[09/14/18, 7:03:59 AM] <JJ_Dane> I have a feeling break dance for me would include more breaking than dancing tbh
[09/14/18, 7:04:24 AM] <Ossborn> Either somebody hijacked Ryans account... or he has a secret twin... cant think about any other options...
[09/14/18, 7:04:35 AM] <Danoba> @Ossborn You're not wrong.
[09/14/18, 7:05:05 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Oh a sequel episode.
[09/14/18, 7:05:05 AM] <KBTibbs> I bet Hector stole Ryan's account
[09/14/18, 7:05:10 AM] <JJ_Dane> Must be the same guy that hijacks phones and tweets
[09/14/18, 7:05:44 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> Never was much of a fan of the related musical genres.
[09/14/18, 7:05:50 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> What if Ryan has been LoreMaster enough he can now communicate in chat WITH HIS MIND
[09/14/18, 7:05:54 AM] <Zomaks> hello

[09/14/18, 7:06:30 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Everytime i touch my lip or face, I am typing in chat.
[09/14/18, 7:06:55 AM] <Danoba> Ryan is suuuper good at that, just watch, keep count if you can.
[09/14/18, 7:07:02 AM] <cinphoria> Ryan you can't just go around telling everyone your secrets :P
[09/14/18, 7:07:12 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> To be honest. I had just shaved, so my face was itchy.
[09/14/18, 7:07:28 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> hmm... something tells me @HydroSnail_RyanGreen is feeding us false tells so he can win at chat poker night
[09/14/18, 7:07:49 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> @Deathstar_Taco I'm sorry... wat? Poker Chat?
[09/14/18, 7:08:00 AM] <HydroSnail_RyanGreen> Chat Poker*
[09/14/18, 7:08:11 AM] <Danoba> No that was also correct, we do both.

There is 2 Hours, 46 Minutes, 56 Seconds until the next episode of Critical Role. This command has been run 1154 times but has probably been asked about way more. gandsNein
