[09/15/18, 11:04:48 AM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night.
[09/15/18, 11:04:49 AM] <Trogdortheberninator> Annabelle is Obfuscated!
[09/15/18, 11:04:49 AM] <zaryin> I used to play Milwaukee by Night back in the early 90â€™s. Fun.
[09/15/18, 11:04:52 AM] <elmerg99> farlas816: I've played in games based in Cinci, and even smaller places like Lexington.

[09/15/18, 11:05:22 AM] <Ozai75> Victor is a Ventrue
[09/15/18, 11:05:27 AM] <japenrose> @shidareAKI It helps that the Lakers haven't been winning, fewer basketball induced rioting
[09/15/18, 11:05:28 AM] <revenstein> Victor is like: speaking of dinner...
[09/15/18, 11:05:29 AM] <ArisBranwin> I'm thinking she *might* be a Brujuah-hah or a Gangerel

[09/15/18, 11:05:51 AM] <ArisBranwin> He has the look DOWN
[09/15/18, 11:05:51 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> When I ran an LA campaign, I had a Toreador prince, because LA.

[09/15/18, 11:05:53 AM] <Sylien_> Jasper is Nosferatu
[09/15/18, 11:05:53 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @aris i can see both of those and they are diametricly opposed
[09/15/18, 11:05:54 AM] <Tysere> I want to say he's a Nos
[09/15/18, 11:05:54 AM] <revenstein> Jason and Jasper are my favs
[09/15/18, 11:05:58 AM] <PrimroseFrost> @GreyAngel Alex always looks amazing.

[09/15/18, 11:06:00 AM] <StraightErro> I think Erika is a Gangrel, when they showed her name, there was the Gangrel wolf head eating the sun
[09/15/18, 11:06:01 AM] <Ozai75> @ArisBranwin thanks :)
[09/15/18, 11:06:01 AM] <ArisBranwin> Like PROPS to Alex as a Nossie
[09/15/18, 11:06:03 AM] <TrueXarkos21> I'm already a fan of Alex as a Nos, it seems to fit.
[09/15/18, 11:06:04 AM] <Zibani> I'm so happy for more VTM on twitch.

[09/15/18, 11:06:20 AM] <Chibicyborg> Annabelle could be Gangrel
[09/15/18, 11:06:20 AM] <nicolasp12> What system is being used?
[09/15/18, 11:06:22 AM] <TaleOfTwoWolves> Nosferatu can't go topside because they're easily recognizable.
[09/15/18, 11:06:23 AM] <durgenmcchuckles> nosferatu for ever!
[09/15/18, 11:06:26 AM] <rhyatt63> Where is Erika?

[09/15/18, 11:06:42 AM] <Coach_Chilibob> Is Annabelle using Obfuscate?
[09/15/18, 11:06:50 AM] <KBTibbs> @rhyatt63 She's a dramatic entrance type of character
[09/15/18, 11:06:52 AM] <GrayWardenElf> Jasper is gangrel
[09/15/18, 11:06:52 AM] <Zibani> Fork and Knife.

[09/15/18, 11:07:06 AM] <Trogdortheberninator> @Coach_Chilibob I believe so
[09/15/18, 11:07:08 AM] <TaleOfTwoWolves> It's so funny how vampires think they're even humans with feelings. lol
[09/15/18, 11:07:08 AM] <Mobius___> Is Annabelle a creepy doll?
[09/15/18, 11:07:10 AM] <MagusXIX> Oh man ... Masquerade and not Requiem? Hrm.

[09/15/18, 11:07:31 AM] <Slippydude> @Mobius___ no but Erica is.
[09/15/18, 11:07:36 AM] <AtmaPrime> @g0rmyr This is the begging, you just missed the intro
[09/15/18, 11:07:36 AM] <TrueXarkos21> My guess is Erika is either Malk or a thin blood

[09/15/18, 11:07:56 AM] <TaleOfTwoWolves> Gen 12-13?
[09/15/18, 11:07:58 AM] <Zibani> Erika is apparently likely a Gangrel.
[09/15/18, 11:08:01 AM] <nobledwarf> Hi all, so exited for this stream!
[09/15/18, 11:08:04 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> wait. did vampires create Iron Kids Bread?
[09/15/18, 11:08:07 AM] <aethersphinx> Ay, Thursday by Night introduced me to Vampire too! I ended up getting the V5 book hoping to find people to play eventually

[09/15/18, 11:08:13 AM] <SiderealEX> By the by folks, there are also new clans part of the Camarilla now as well.
[09/15/18, 11:08:15 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @CrohnieOwnie You should check out Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. It's a bit of a janky video game, but patched, it's a great game and introduction to the world of Vampire.
[09/15/18, 11:08:17 AM] <TaleOfTwoWolves> Boo, Camarilla.
[09/15/18, 11:08:18 AM] <Kasmirel> Any of you wanting to see more VtM on Twitch, you can find regular games on Roll4it and GamingFTL off the top of my head. Some good games ongoing.
[09/15/18, 11:08:20 AM] <misroi> Annabelle just has her arms folded across her chest, that's why we can't see her.

[09/15/18, 11:09:07 AM] <DarkestArgentum> their is a reason why noss make good assasins
[09/15/18, 11:09:08 AM] <super390> oh yeah, Jasper, you should definitely cosplay as a computer science major.

[09/15/18, 11:09:17 AM] <revenstein> is it bad that when they roll the die it looks inappropriate
[09/15/18, 11:09:20 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Uh oh...
[09/15/18, 11:09:20 AM] <Mobius___> mmmm
[09/15/18, 11:09:25 AM] <cinphoria> @Critternation3000 We just started! maybe 5 minutes
[09/15/18, 11:09:26 AM] <TheOnyxPath> Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a fantastic game, and takes place in LA in 2004. If you get it from GOG, it comes with all the latest patches.
[09/15/18, 11:09:28 AM] <Hazgarn> It almost seemed too obvious to guess Alex would be a Nosferatu, but in hindsight it would be a waste if he wasn't.
[09/15/18, 11:09:30 AM] <alaktyrr> Victor is Ventrue
[09/15/18, 11:09:30 AM] <revenstein> I can't unsee
[09/15/18, 11:09:31 AM] <AN0D0S> That Annabele is a tall drink of water, isn't she?
[09/15/18, 11:09:34 AM] <darkerdaysradio> @MagusXIX though to be fair, my chronicle is my Requiem chronicle with some reskinning.
[09/15/18, 11:09:36 AM] <yerawizardkelly> Oh shooooot
[09/15/18, 11:09:40 AM] <AtmaPrime> Already getting hungry..
[09/15/18, 11:09:40 AM] <TaleOfTwoWolves> @Zibani Yet thinbloods exist.
[09/15/18, 11:09:40 AM] <madamepenguin> first roll, this is going to turn out well
[09/15/18, 11:09:41 AM] <o_coghlan> Requiem LUL
[09/15/18, 11:09:42 AM] <ArisBranwin> He does good costuming.. so yeah

[09/15/18, 11:09:51 AM] <emw_3> is Annabelle the water or the mic?!?
[09/15/18, 11:10:00 AM] <TheMostNinjOfToads> First check is a failure, this can only go better then ya?
[09/15/18, 11:10:03 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @alexwhitechats Indeed!
[09/15/18, 11:10:05 AM] <SiderealEX> Yeah, more into Chronicles of Darkness these days instead of World of Darkness.
[09/15/18, 11:10:07 AM] <GreyAngel> @emw_3 both
[09/15/18, 11:10:11 AM] <SiderealEX> But it's neat to see the WoD returning.
[09/15/18, 11:10:12 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @TheOnyxPath Sometimes it is out of date so it is best to just reinstall the patch over it.
[09/15/18, 11:10:16 AM] <TrueXarkos21> I'm so used to 3E and Revised Laws of the Night, I'm looking forward to seeing the differences in 5E
[09/15/18, 11:10:17 AM] <Zismarith> @emw_3 Chair.
[09/15/18, 11:10:18 AM] <AN0D0S> I'm getting thirsty for Annabelle
[09/15/18, 11:10:20 AM] <CaffeinatedConquests> @TheOnyxPath Hey! Mr. Watson! How goes it!
[09/15/18, 11:10:21 AM] <sabrona91> Aaaah how late am I?

[09/15/18, 11:10:35 AM] <Kasmirel> @SiderealEX The new version (5th) borrows a lot of the things that make CofD good. You might like it.
[09/15/18, 11:10:37 AM] <revenstein> I adore Jasper
[09/15/18, 11:10:38 AM] <MagusXIX> Oh, hey Ian. ^_^ Long time no see.
[09/15/18, 11:10:40 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @VermillionCrimson IIRC they recently updated to the latest 10.0 patch, so you should be good.
[09/15/18, 11:10:41 AM] <Zibani> Oh, hey, it's @TheOnyxPath
[09/15/18, 11:10:43 AM] <HalfDonut> What system are they using?

[09/15/18, 11:10:48 AM] <misroi> Erika is so into her character that she refuses to let modern technology capture her image.
[09/15/18, 11:10:54 AM] <CraigOxbrow> Hello @TheOnyxPath
[09/15/18, 11:10:56 AM] <revenstein> I love the contact lenses
