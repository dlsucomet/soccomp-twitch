[09/19/18, 7:10:19 AM] <super390> @Deathstar_Taco I wouldn't even try a chocolate soda, so I guess Shasta wins by default. Now for a really good soda that technically isn't "grape", I'd suggest Mexican sangria-flavored soda, ideally with real sugar.
[09/19/18, 7:10:20 AM] <baxorn> Cant nintendo just get a normal naming scheme please
