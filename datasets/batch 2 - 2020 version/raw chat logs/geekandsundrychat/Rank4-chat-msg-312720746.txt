[09/21/18, 7:15:00 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Oh that's nice
[09/21/18, 7:15:10 AM] <LibrarianLizz> oh bless libraries forever

[09/21/18, 7:17:57 AM] <chaoticloony> Avengers Annual #16 (1987) is my favorite comic of all time!
[09/21/18, 7:18:26 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I'm kind of doubting there is a classic Alpha Flight collection
[09/21/18, 7:19:04 AM] <LibrarianLizz> Boston Brand?

[09/21/18, 7:19:09 AM] <Ultio21> Cable and Deadpool is my favorite
[09/21/18, 7:19:57 AM] <chaoticloony> Iron Man is always a 2nd tier character to me
[09/21/18, 7:20:00 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Yes, Alpha Flight!!!
[09/21/18, 7:20:10 AM] <cinphoria> We socialised superheroes :P
