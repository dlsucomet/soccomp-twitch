[09/22/18, 11:02:20 AM] <anderfc> I find it harder to play a newly created Kindred. You need to play the process and the shock that is turning into a monster. Erika is doing very well.

[09/22/18, 11:09:21 AM] <spacejac> audio does seem a bit off
[09/22/18, 11:09:22 AM] <CaffeinatedNate> balancing of sound is WAY off, most of the sound is coming pout of the left side
[09/22/18, 11:09:26 AM] <cinphoria> @jr_bob_loblaw it's sliiiiightly louder in the left channel but it should be coming through both
[09/22/18, 11:09:30 AM] <MissNayoung> Once the Beast awakens it is very hard to put it back in its cage. Not impossible mind you but it takes some effort.
[09/22/18, 11:09:30 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @thesithgirl Star wars Ttrpg on youtube pencils and parsecs. Uses the Edge of Empires system
[09/22/18, 11:09:35 AM] <Ghostdave1> Is it me or is the video a bit fuzzy
[09/22/18, 11:09:45 AM] <NightWitch588> audio works well for me
[09/22/18, 11:09:45 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> thanks @cinphoria
[09/22/18, 11:09:49 AM] <alseides1617> Does anyone knows the name of the intro song or at least the style (maybe is cyber punk)?
[09/22/18, 11:09:51 AM] <RJLadyA> @copper_monkey alex is a horror creature actor. so yup! :)
[09/22/18, 11:09:51 AM] <Zismarith> @TheDiMono If someone said it WAS made specifically with him in mind, the shock value would be low.
[09/22/18, 11:09:53 AM] <evilfluffy665> How long do you think Victor was a ghoul?
[09/22/18, 11:09:54 AM] <thesithgirl> @Alexanderhero83 ooo! ill check it out, thanks!
[09/22/18, 11:09:56 AM] <ChainsawGothic> what's one more missing car in L.A., more or less

[09/22/18, 11:10:08 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> and thanks @kaioraya
[09/22/18, 11:10:11 AM] <Gray_Mask> Left ear heavy, is it just me?
[09/22/18, 11:10:13 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Yeah the audio balance issue from Caiisto 6 has persisted over to this.
[09/22/18, 11:10:22 AM] <Ghostdave1> it cleared now thanks
[09/22/18, 11:10:25 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> the actor portraying Jasper actually makes a living portraying monsters in shows
[09/22/18, 11:10:27 AM] <Ferr0vax> @Ghostdave1 @jr_bob_loblaw I'm getting a little fuzzy sound, primarily from left channel, but it's still relatively clear.
[09/22/18, 11:10:40 AM] <ChainsawGothic> Not the V Word!
[09/22/18, 11:10:45 AM] <VermillionCrimson> There is a fan noise.

[09/22/18, 11:11:19 AM] <MissNayoung> @Spidermanfresh His actor's name is Alex Ward. Professional monster actor.
[09/22/18, 11:11:40 AM] <chiplickin> Yes and.... :D
[09/22/18, 11:11:42 AM] <cinphoria> It's left-heavy and we've been having technical issues with that today. I've been solving it on my end by balancing my operating system output
[09/22/18, 11:11:44 AM] <stunningepiphanies> gosh i love erika
