[09/27/18, 10:07:30 AM] <SolaeXIII> *trumpets sound*
[09/27/18, 10:07:32 AM] <feathersflight> Hopefully this is because there's gonna be a fashion show

[09/27/18, 10:07:41 AM] <misssunflower94> Who do we have to attack to get the table back?
[09/27/18, 10:07:42 AM] <Danoba> @cinphoria There was never able.
[09/27/18, 10:07:47 AM] <Sylien_> WE ARE UNSETTLED
[09/27/18, 10:07:48 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Perhaps they want to be able to stand up?
[09/27/18, 10:07:49 AM] <sunlitlake> CHANGE. NO. I don't like it.
[09/27/18, 10:07:49 AM] <Ebonitacocat> Fashionably late
[09/27/18, 10:07:53 AM] <Strryeyedreamr27> I'm so excited!
[09/27/18, 10:07:54 AM] <Danoba> See, I couldn't even write it.
[09/27/18, 10:07:54 AM] <shidareAKI> @Danoba that's evil XD
[09/27/18, 10:07:55 AM] <GreyAngel> They're so far apart!!
[09/27/18, 10:07:55 AM] <cinphoria> @Danoba >(
[09/27/18, 10:08:01 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> I'm guessing no table so we can include maximum voguing
[09/27/18, 10:08:02 AM] <postdataest> Table" what table?
[09/27/18, 10:08:02 AM] <emergencycocktail> ADDRESS THIS
[09/27/18, 10:08:04 AM] <JuneBe> ooh, subtle nerd is my fav
[09/27/18, 10:08:05 AM] <misssunflower94> We don't have object permanence! we're LOST
[09/27/18, 10:08:06 AM] <lizardbreath27> hard to have a fashion show with a table in the way
[09/27/18, 10:08:08 AM] <Ebonitacocat> Wait did the couch fully break
[09/27/18, 10:08:09 AM] <geekmomma3> Maybe they had to make room for fashion show.
[09/27/18, 10:08:11 AM] <spiritualsirene> Rainbows are close enough to vogue
[09/27/18, 10:08:16 AM] <cinphoria> Taliesin's wearing eyeliner. That makes up for no table :/
[09/27/18, 10:08:21 AM] <cinphoria> LOL thank you Amy
[09/27/18, 10:08:22 AM] <GreyAngel> Tal's wearing eyeliner and that calms me
[09/27/18, 10:08:23 AM] <misssunflower94> Months now Taliesin it's been months ;)
[09/27/18, 10:08:24 AM] <cinphoria> ...phrasing Tal
[09/27/18, 10:08:25 AM] ** shidareAKI hands out maps to gently guide everyone into TWC.
[09/27/18, 10:08:25 AM] <Slippydude> Friends, the Table is currently in it's Secret Alter Ego, don't give away it's secret identity!
[09/27/18, 10:08:25 AM] <Danoba> @shidareAKI I'm kidding, we figured for today's show it would be easier without one.
[09/27/18, 10:08:26 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> the real table was the friends we make along the way
[09/27/18, 10:08:29 AM] <cinphoria> @GreyAngel right?
[09/27/18, 10:08:30 AM] <herladykrow> Is Taliesin wearing eyeliner or is that just exhaustion?
[09/27/18, 10:08:31 AM] <phoenixgoth> Bless you Amy
[09/27/18, 10:08:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Some things have changed but we're still here, folks. <3
[09/27/18, 10:08:40 AM] <phoenixgoth> @Danoba Ah, that explains it
[09/27/18, 10:08:42 AM] <ArisBranwin> It doesn't make up for it.. but hey.. I'm glad for what is there. So yay.
[09/27/18, 10:08:43 AM] <sunlitlake> He is rocking that fashion look @cinphoria
[09/27/18, 10:08:46 AM] <shidareAKI> @Danoba it's a fashion show after all!
[09/27/18, 10:08:48 AM] <Ebonitacocat> @herladykrow probably both
[09/27/18, 10:08:49 AM] <Sylien_> @herladykrow it's eyeliner
[09/27/18, 10:08:50 AM] <AromiaFlyce> OMG LADIES! Their Batman dress HAS POCKETS
[09/27/18, 10:08:51 AM] <cinphoria> Apparently we've learned that it's ok there's no table as long as Taliesin's wearing eyeliner :P
[09/27/18, 10:08:52 AM] <Danoba> @shidareAKI Indeed.
[09/27/18, 10:08:53 AM] <axe_lobo_galen> Table is gone but Tal's make-up game is on point
[09/27/18, 10:08:54 AM] <misssunflower94> eyeliner AND exhaustion @herladykrow
[09/27/18, 10:08:54 AM] <ToonEzon> loving everyone's look
[09/27/18, 10:08:58 AM] <sunlitlake> Matt is wearing the HEIGHT of fashion though which is the Daisy Pin B)
[09/27/18, 10:09:01 AM] <Slippydude> @cinphoria white powder? Some sort of SPICE?!
[09/27/18, 10:09:02 AM] <ToonEzon> and dang i am not prepped for comicon
[09/27/18, 10:09:02 AM] <JodyHouser> Oh God, how is NYCC next week????
[09/27/18, 10:09:03 AM] <Medinaquirin> I like the fathomless pit behind Matt's chair.
[09/27/18, 10:09:05 AM] <Countxaero> Where’s the giant table?
[09/27/18, 10:09:06 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> @herladykrow Por que no los dos?
[09/27/18, 10:09:08 AM] <Asrathiel2912> maybe the table is shipping to MCM as a special guest... =D
[09/27/18, 10:09:08 AM] <misssunflower94> I'm still mourning the table
[09/27/18, 10:09:14 AM] <misssunflower94> oh hi @JodyHouser
[09/27/18, 10:09:16 AM] <spiritualsirene> Tal teach me how to put on eyeliner without turning into a raccoon
[09/27/18, 10:09:25 AM] <JeffM0307> Hello @JodyHouser
[09/27/18, 10:09:28 AM] <Ebonitacocat> @misssunflower94 what happened to the table
[09/27/18, 10:09:32 AM] <sunlitlake> @misssunflower94 "Eyeliner and Exhaustion" could easily be the name of my GenCon adventures.

[09/27/18, 10:10:45 AM] <owifig> Such a delightfully specific memory
[09/27/18, 10:10:50 AM] <WDM1262> My guess is Table is not there for fashion show
[09/27/18, 10:10:54 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> the counch is a few weeks old @Countxaero ; matt sat on the arm of the old one & it busted
[09/27/18, 10:11:12 AM] <Countxaero> Lol
[09/27/18, 10:11:15 AM] <sunlitlake> Question for chat: Why did I just wave back at Matt?
[09/27/18, 10:11:18 AM] <FuffyButt> My dad always did the grocery shopping. it was his job to bring home the bacon #DadJoke
[09/27/18, 10:11:19 AM] <misssunflower94> oh wait I need to get my comics pride mug! I need to Wednesday Club mug it up!
[09/27/18, 10:11:20 AM] <feathersflight> @JustHere4Coffee OMG really?
[09/27/18, 10:11:30 AM] <GreyAngel> I'm so unsettled by this new set
[09/27/18, 10:11:32 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> @sunlitlake because you know they can see you?
[09/27/18, 10:11:36 AM] <darkofnate> @sunlitlake Because you're polite
[09/27/18, 10:11:40 AM] <LilyRose28> @sunlitlake because his enthusiasm is infectious
[09/27/18, 10:11:46 AM] <WDM1262> I hope The Daily Wednesday happens...
[09/27/18, 10:11:47 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> @sunlitlake because how can you not wave back to that face?
[09/27/18, 10:11:53 AM] <Strryeyedreamr27> @sunlitlake I did the same!
[09/27/18, 10:11:53 AM] <sunlitlake> @JustHere4Coffee -- I'm not wearing a bra so I HOPE not.
[09/27/18, 10:11:54 AM] <Countxaero> Honestly, I’m just an old white dude afraid of change.
[09/27/18, 10:12:03 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> @feathersflight I may be exaggerating how it happened, but the arm DID come off
[09/27/18, 10:12:03 AM] <mathemagician_> I wave at them too @sunlitlake
[09/27/18, 10:12:11 AM] <Asrathiel2912> @greyangel I kinda want to mop their floor too... I miss the table hiding all the scuffs
[09/27/18, 10:12:11 AM] <phoenixgoth> @sunlitlake because he's a sweetheart

[09/27/18, 10:15:19 AM] <Sylien_> @sunlitlake I make it when I'm cold in the winter, over the stove, with fresh apple juice with ginger, and then I slice a peeled apple into it, and boil the thing with spices until the apple slices are seethrough. It's the beeeeest.
