[09/28/18, 7:04:46 AM] <Ossborn> What The Physics sounds like a great name for a chaotic Science show... like Kyles Because Science, but with a host like Jeff Lewis :-D
[09/28/18, 7:04:47 AM] <chaoticloony> @DeLevely Hi Sam!
[09/28/18, 7:04:53 AM] <ArisBranwin> Sam is a Timelord/person .. theory confirmed.
[09/28/18, 7:04:54 AM] <perfectcosima> Sam was exposed to Callisto 6 and can now be in two places at once
[09/28/18, 7:04:55 AM] <FuffyButt> which Sam is the real Sam and which one is the skroll
[09/28/18, 7:04:56 AM] <AromiaFlyce> I am so so glad I am not the only one that worries about the laws of physics in a superhero game :D

[09/28/18, 7:08:31 AM] <starpilotsix> You know all those theories like how Anton has stretch powers because he stretches the truth as a PR guy, etc. Maybe the power changes reality the same way and made Venice more like Venice. ;)
