[09/28/18, 11:16:07 AM] <ScottishPicnic> Beau always acts so hard, but is the first one to think everything crosses the line
[09/28/18, 11:16:07 AM] <GaeaCa> @freeridercam hour and 15
[09/28/18, 11:16:09 AM] <BadSkeelz> I hope Beau apologizes to Marius. That'd be a nice gesture on her part after realizing this got out of hand (and that she probably enjoyed it)
[09/28/18, 11:16:10 AM] <NoahMcBadass> They weren't BAD people they killed, just criminals. And even if they were bad, y'know, they weren't slavers or anything.

[09/28/18, 11:16:27 AM] <jon_the_joker> Caleb is the bbeg
[09/28/18, 11:16:28 AM] <VPhoenix7> Fix youtube stream so i can watch my TV :(
[09/28/18, 11:16:36 AM] <KyleCorbeau> I mean to be fair Caleb was brain washed as a kid to accept that the ends justify the means. So it's not terribly weird for him NOT to feel weird about this
[09/28/18, 11:16:40 AM] <chilobobo> LUL
[09/28/18, 11:16:40 AM] <BaronVonOwn> if the pirates attacked them, technically they didn't have to run from the guards yeah?
[09/28/18, 11:16:41 AM] <TerrorMoose> dont ignore yasha BibleThump
[09/28/18, 11:16:42 AM] <Mizuurei> Oooooo, this will cause some interesting character conflict between the Nein~ Very interesting!
[09/28/18, 11:16:42 AM] <VolatileSupernova> @tetrahydridodinitrogen calling someone a murder hobo for killing their attacker is a bit hyperbolic
[09/28/18, 11:16:45 AM] <stackty> the mighty nein might not end up just playing an evil crew

[09/28/18, 11:16:49 AM] <JarydThommers> Actual Monk moment
[09/28/18, 11:16:50 AM] <SirBlakeAJSA> With an amount of power comes an amount of responsibility
[09/28/18, 11:16:54 AM] <juicedmark> @NeuralProdigy I think it's more of the back to back nature of it, and having multiple members on the brink of death in situations they could have avoided with a bit more effort
[09/28/18, 11:16:54 AM] <sandwichmage181> "That was actually very profound"
[09/28/18, 11:16:55 AM] <darkgr7m> where's Laura?
[09/28/18, 11:16:57 AM] <GlyndSuresight> :)
[09/28/18, 11:16:59 AM] <Deeds1232> first ppl complain that they were "murder hobos", now ppl are complaining that they are questioning their actions. They can grow and change, and have guilt and learn from that!! let them grow
[09/28/18, 11:17:01 AM] <optimisticrealist> damn beau with that deep insight
[09/28/18, 11:17:02 AM] <SnakesBandana> @truekillermilk ZULUL
[09/28/18, 11:17:02 AM] <elric_stark> So... Caleb's still evil. That's depressing
[09/28/18, 11:17:02 AM] <xianrodd> what time is the break usually?
[09/28/18, 11:17:03 AM] <beardedflannelman> Talisan had a great moment and Laura capped it off... Now Marisha wants some of the spotlight.
[09/28/18, 11:17:04 AM] <moordnnaar> what happened to the youtube show??
[09/28/18, 11:17:04 AM] <davenknox> @NoahMcBadass The guy in the sluice wasn't a criminal or bad he just got too clingy to an escort and then got beaten nearly to death in his own work place - which is a restricted area LUL
[09/28/18, 11:17:05 AM] <LucasBlackstone> @NoahMcBadass They were pretty bad. Someone saw them on the docks and were given orders to kill them and were okay with following those orders
[09/28/18, 11:17:05 AM] <nik8112> she just punched a guy to wake him up...
[09/28/18, 11:17:09 AM] <Zorglubis> The road to enlightenment.
[09/28/18, 11:17:11 AM] <4bundy> seriously you don't usually talk down people after combat started

[09/28/18, 11:17:12 AM] <sunnybarra> So it crapped out right? Missed everything after Cad went to cook
[09/28/18, 11:17:14 AM] <noramermaid> what did i miss?
[09/28/18, 11:17:14 AM] <Rathnier512> So, can anyone talk about how Beau punches people to wake them up, but now feels bad that she beats the shit out of people to get things done??
[09/28/18, 11:17:14 AM] <grunnikins> The scene on Sam's flask is from the British sketch comedy show "That Mitchell and Webb Look". It's the highest ratio of hit-to-miss in a sketch comedy I've ever seen.
[09/28/18, 11:17:17 AM] <ShakeSomeSpeare> "That was actually very profound"
[09/28/18, 11:17:17 AM] <chuckswain> @stackty luv u 2 bby
[09/28/18, 11:17:18 AM] <itsakigs> Did the Youtube stream just go down?

[09/28/18, 11:17:21 AM] <meryahfromthegarden> isn't beau already in a mutual check situation with caleb?
[09/28/18, 11:17:25 AM] <scogeobro> check for what??
[09/28/18, 11:17:27 AM] <DomreKuyo> Been listening to podcast for a few weeks, super glad to catch a stream
[09/28/18, 11:17:33 AM] <theplotchickens1234> fjord did you know that i would die for you
[09/28/18, 11:17:34 AM] <xxardanxx> They are way to hard on themselves. Those pirates at the docks weren‚Äôt just going to stop and have a nice chat. Their first immediate response to seeing the team was to start trying to kill them.
[09/28/18, 11:17:36 AM] <BlackMemberAC> talk to yasha...
[09/28/18, 11:17:36 AM] <cinphoria> @Rathnier512 yeah you should watch the last Talks Machina.
[09/28/18, 11:17:38 AM] <keysmaash> caleb burned his parents and like so many other people alive hes probably just happy they only killed like 6 people
[09/28/18, 11:17:38 AM] <FadedTragiik> okay for real
[09/28/18, 11:17:38 AM] <the_sauce_doctor> @beardedflannelman is that what you really think is happening?
[09/28/18, 11:17:38 AM] <GaeaCa> @miniveemon The CR team is working on it
