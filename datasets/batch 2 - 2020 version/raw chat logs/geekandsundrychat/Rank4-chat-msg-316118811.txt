[09/29/18, 11:11:07 AM] <MissNayoung> I remeber the Kindred The Embraced television series and it was something of an in-name only VTM television series.

[09/29/18, 11:11:21 AM] <ChainsawGothic> "no strings attached"
[09/29/18, 11:11:25 AM] <DarkestArgentum> Annabelle GOOD that SHOULD be your attitude when carrying a gun
[09/29/18, 11:11:29 AM] <ChainsawGothic> Pull the string! Pull the string!

[09/29/18, 11:11:37 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @MissNayoung Kindred: The Embraced wasn't bad. It holds up surprisingly well.
[09/29/18, 11:11:37 AM] <boone_faustus> I kind of wish there wasn't a rights dispute so Underworld could have been the VtM movie it was meant to be.
[09/29/18, 11:11:38 AM] <DarkestArgentum> only a real psycho wants to use a gun
[09/29/18, 11:11:41 AM] <Ayashisama> more like 20mins max @krazyflower

[09/29/18, 11:12:42 AM] <DakuBara> she doesn't role for that?
[09/29/18, 11:12:44 AM] <palehorn23> the vtm show was okay but it could of been so much better if they stayed truer to the source material instead of watering it down
[09/29/18, 11:12:48 AM] <Dragonchrome> @Wlvrn31 at 11.40pm
