[10/5/18, 7:08:40 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @EricaTheStrange
[10/5/18, 7:08:41 AM] <BierceProsnan700> EricaTheStrange HeyGuys
[10/5/18, 7:08:41 AM] <Smarcey> Are we talking Shippuden spoilers or only specificlly pre time skip spoilers?
[10/5/18, 7:08:46 AM] <DarkestArgentum> ppl hate on naruto and 90% of that is the filler arcs wich yea most are trash
[10/5/18, 7:09:21 AM] <shidareAKI> Well a lot of people had the same issue with Bleach's filler episodes
[10/5/18, 7:09:35 AM] <Smarcey> And One Piece
[10/5/18, 7:09:45 AM] <shidareAKI> Yup, filler episodes can kill an anime.
[10/5/18, 7:09:56 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Filler is always gona be an issue with anime that are based off ongoing manga
[10/5/18, 7:09:59 AM] <Ossborn> It´s not currently running on TV in my country AFAIK, but wehen it was on, I sometimes watched it.... it was okay, to watch
[10/5/18, 7:10:16 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> I for one had issues with BSG's filler episodes in the second season (the newer BSG)
[10/5/18, 7:10:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Naruto, One Piece and Pokemon all have annoying characters that i can't stand!
[10/5/18, 7:10:34 AM] <MatchaBunnyRain> Doesn't Sakura wear like a fooooorm of a QiPao?
[10/5/18, 7:10:45 AM] <Smarcey> Pretty much if your not following the story from the Manga theres no reason to make the show. Especially when you think of how expensive it is to animate.
[10/5/18, 7:11:03 AM] <SirPlumpy> Check out Pokemon Origins or Generations Series. They are short but imo waaaay better for older fans
[10/5/18, 7:11:04 AM] <shidareAKI> Yep, that's true of a lot of manga/anime. It doesn't help that a lot of them lean hard into stereotypical tropes.
[10/5/18, 7:11:07 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @shidareAKI naruto had a couple of decent fillers that were prety good but the one with the kid obsesed with Tsubaki flowers and the crystal chakra user DRAAAAAGED
[10/5/18, 7:11:09 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Oh, yay! It's Sam and Xander! :D
[10/5/18, 7:11:38 AM] <DarkestArgentum> *claps* nice one same
[10/5/18, 7:11:42 AM] <shidareAKI> Yeah I never made it into the Naruto or One Piece world. I like short anime. I could never commit to anything longer than a 24 episode run.
[10/5/18, 7:11:57 AM] <ars68> yay Naruto. I loved watching it so much, but I have to ask: fillers. love them or hate them? I personally thought they weren't that bad on there own, they defenitely gave a sense of the world a bit more... but there was just so much, that after a while you start wondering 'is this really going to matter in 30 minutes when we are at the next episode?'?
[10/5/18, 7:12:09 AM] <Smarcey> The difference is that in the East, they have a wider market for different subgenres of comics, as in Europe. Its really only here in the states that capes dominated the medium.
[10/5/18, 7:12:20 AM] <Ossborn> Dragonball imho is the worst with a single arena fight lasting for several episodes
[10/5/18, 7:12:26 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @shidareAKI the long runnign ones i HIGHLY recomend reading the manga before touching the anime you will know where to skip
[10/5/18, 7:12:45 AM] <Zismarith> @shidareAKI Same problem. I mean, My Hero Academia, but I didn't know it was gonna run 3+ season.
[10/5/18, 7:12:54 AM] <DarkestArgentum> ...though i LOVED sailor moons Doom tree arc Alans flute was my ringtone for a long time
[10/5/18, 7:12:57 AM] <EricaTheStrange> They did that with Duels in Yugioh @Ossborn
[10/5/18, 7:13:04 AM] <flashwavexl> Bidet chat & all.
[10/5/18, 7:13:11 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @flashwavexl
[10/5/18, 7:13:12 AM] <SouperDumpling> @Smarcey "Thank" the comics code for that, for better or worst
[10/5/18, 7:13:12 AM] <Smarcey> Naruto is gonna try to pull off a Legend of Kora
[10/5/18, 7:13:24 AM] <Smarcey> WhatADumpling True.
[10/5/18, 7:13:30 AM] <shidareAKI> @DarkestArgentum and here is my other pillar of "nerd shame" I don't like manga or comics much. I do buy and try to read independent runs written by friends, but the sheer volume and the style of the media has never lit my world on fire. XD
[10/5/18, 7:13:52 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Haha
[10/5/18, 7:13:52 AM] <WizardWithATopHat> I'm sorry, I'm new here, is there some sort of stream schedule somewhere?
[10/5/18, 7:13:52 AM] <chaoticloony> The Yu-Gi-Oh shows i like
[10/5/18, 7:14:04 AM] <cinphoria> @WizardWithATopHat right below the video window :)
[10/5/18, 7:14:08 AM] <Gordonsan> Im sorry, can someone tell me the hosts name?
[10/5/18, 7:14:12 AM] <cinphoria> !whodat

[10/5/18, 7:14:22 AM] <Gordonsan> thank you
[10/5/18, 7:14:23 AM] <darock44> what time is critical role tonight
[10/5/18, 7:14:25 AM] <SnowHermit> It's a weird thought, but I'd want to see Xander GM a Naruto RPG
[10/5/18, 7:14:27 AM] <postdataest> Critical Role (C2ep37) is scheduled to be streamed at its usual time , though it will not be 'live', it will be delayed 1 hour so stream will begin at the usual 7 pm Pacific time.
[10/5/18, 7:14:29 AM] <shidareAKI> Sam de freakin' Leve our very favoritest NB
[10/5/18, 7:14:31 AM] <cinphoria> @darock44 same time as usual
[10/5/18, 7:14:33 AM] <EricaTheStrange> The main arcs are like Diet coke and the fillers are like store brand coke
[10/5/18, 7:14:38 AM] <chaoticloony> @darock44 Same time as always
[10/5/18, 7:14:49 AM] <Andyinsomnia> the last 100ish episodes of original Naruto are skippable filler
[10/5/18, 7:14:53 AM] <SouperDumpling> Filler eps are basically like the EU of Star Wars
[10/5/18, 7:15:00 AM] <Smarcey> I just dont believe the answer that "people will loose interest" if the show goes off the air to wait for original story from the Manga. Dont waste money making crappy animation just stop production and make something else.... =/
[10/5/18, 7:15:02 AM] <MetalBabyMario> There's some good filler, but Naruto making ramen with the Rasengan is where I draw the line :P
[10/5/18, 7:15:05 AM] <flashwavexl> Xander played X the Malkavian so well last Fri.

[10/5/18, 7:15:19 AM] <Smarcey> There 100% ignoreable
[10/5/18, 7:15:29 AM] <Smarcey> There are sites you can go to that tell you what to skip.
[10/5/18, 7:15:38 AM] <EricaTheStrange> it wouldn't be exciting if we had it all the time @Deathstar_Taco
[10/5/18, 7:15:55 AM] <Smarcey> In every instance
[10/5/18, 7:15:59 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> @flashwavexl I loved X! It was a great episode! :D

[10/5/18, 7:16:13 AM] <chaoticloony> Some filler episodes are good, but many are just trash, no matter what show has them
[10/5/18, 7:16:13 AM] <ars68> absolutely. there are some filler that was legitimately interesting, funny, or cool to watch. unfortunately the other 80% was sooooo forgettable, it really hurt.
[10/5/18, 7:16:17 AM] <DJPheonyx> Ah yes... the Renegade Viewing
[10/5/18, 7:16:17 AM] <Paladin356> Xander, you underestimate my power!
[10/5/18, 7:16:17 AM] <flashwavexl> Machete Order sounds proper.
[10/5/18, 7:16:20 AM] <SouperDumpling> some filler anime is totally all right if you are into goofy non canon stuff, like the stuff in DBZ
[10/5/18, 7:16:35 AM] <wawila> isn't it like 35% filler?
[10/5/18, 7:16:44 AM] <Smarcey> Watch it after you get through the real episodes. LUL
