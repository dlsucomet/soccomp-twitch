[10/6/18, 7:09:26 AM] <SenatraGG> Am I the only one here who noticed that Gina wore the that thing (I don't know the name of it) to her right arm today, but she was wearing it to her left before :D
[10/6/18, 7:09:28 AM] <SnowHermit> I hope Xander poses with her for a Library Bards joke
[10/6/18, 7:09:44 AM] <Darastrygat> @VermillionCrimson For most superheroes, I agree, but that's for people who understand their powers better and more importantly, know they can't be taken away. Our superpunks here... don't know that.
[10/6/18, 7:09:48 AM] <theRomanticPast> boone_faustus cool. will check out for sure thanks

[10/6/18, 7:11:21 AM] <talahar> poor bonny needs to sit alone
[10/6/18, 7:11:40 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I have a feeling Kylen's plan involves "drawing" the power source of the the cast in way that would kill them. Basically capturing them.
