[10/6/18, 11:01:03 AM] <fussybucket> is there traditionally much combat in VtM? Is it the show's direction that makes this seem more like a stage play?

[10/6/18, 11:10:57 AM] <MissCeraBellum> are there people here that do vtm games via the interwebs?

[10/6/18, 11:11:15 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> probably on Roll20
[10/6/18, 11:11:19 AM] <ChainsawGothic> Roll20 is a popular locale for online Vampire games.
[10/6/18, 11:11:22 AM] <fussybucket> no chaotic evil chars yet?
[10/6/18, 11:11:25 AM] <nerdstroms> somebody needs to make a shirt "delicious, savory time"
[10/6/18, 11:11:27 AM] <Cerrasponda> very non violent vamps
[10/6/18, 11:11:28 AM] <akaaelius> @MissCeraBellum there are a number of games starting up
[10/6/18, 11:11:30 AM] <Ayashisama> I think there should be 2 additional episodes to make up for the loss of Jasper in these ^^"
[10/6/18, 11:11:32 AM] <Ward0g> are they playing V5 or...?
[10/6/18, 11:11:37 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> taking lives is risky in VtM
[10/6/18, 11:11:38 AM] <ChainsawGothic> define "evil" :)
[10/6/18, 11:11:38 AM] <orlliie> chat dubbed him as that last week. if it fits, it fits
[10/6/18, 11:11:39 AM] <KitZunekaze> @MissCeraBellum Yes. I'm running a game on discord + roll20 that takes place in Los Angeles, running alongside this stream
[10/6/18, 11:11:41 AM] <ChainsawGothic> yep, v5!
[10/6/18, 11:11:44 AM] <ScarletMoth> yes @Ward0g
