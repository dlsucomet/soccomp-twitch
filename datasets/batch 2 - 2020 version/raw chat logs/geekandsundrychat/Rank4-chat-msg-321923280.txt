[10/13/18, 10:54:41 AM] <Alexanderhero83> What if Taliesin Jaffe is Annabelle's Sire aka Vampire Daddy
[10/13/18, 10:54:41 AM] <Flight_Devil> Btw, aren't most vampire hunters in VtM just...powerless schlubs?
[10/13/18, 10:54:41 AM] <flipflurpington> I'm torn about Alex being back. On the 1 hand he's back and i missed him. On the other, Xman Bam is no longer with us, I'm gonna miss him.
[10/13/18, 10:54:54 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> you can only see recordings if you're a subscriber
[10/13/18, 10:54:56 AM] <RBGPlays> I wonder what Tal is going to be playing, because he self-identifies as a Malk, and I don't think we're getting another Malk NPC.
[10/13/18, 10:55:01 AM] <ExploringReal> I'm here for Taliesin
[10/13/18, 10:55:04 AM] <knightly2u> @Alexanderhero83 OMG I like that theory
[10/13/18, 10:55:12 AM] <RemiRavenheart> Or have an Alpha
[10/13/18, 10:55:17 AM] <Crossive_> He's probably going to be a Tremere.
[10/13/18, 10:55:20 AM] <KaiOrAya> BTW, if you folks haven't seen it, check out the short they tweeted a little while ago
[10/13/18, 10:55:23 AM] <bookity101> @owifig perhaps. But they do a fairly good job of keeping us looped in
[10/13/18, 10:55:25 AM] <Dani1688> wonder what Taliesin is playing as tonight
[10/13/18, 10:55:27 AM] <Dragonchrome> vods are for subscribers, btu there is a weekend rebroadcast of the weeks programs
[10/13/18, 10:55:28 AM] <Gaming_Unplugged> taliesin is on tonight?
[10/13/18, 10:55:32 AM] <coyotecrow4> Oh yeah. Weeell sodding bollocks...
[10/13/18, 10:55:32 AM] <RBGPlays> I was also thinking Tremere.
[10/13/18, 10:55:38 AM] <StraightErro> But can you picture Tal as a Brujah?
[10/13/18, 10:55:39 AM] <MeggieMay328> I've been hear since Ep 1 - it's a good show
[10/13/18, 10:55:39 AM] <Gaming_Unplugged> wow.. interesting
[10/13/18, 10:55:39 AM] <LordMuffincakes> i wish i had the money to sub... i wanted to catch the episodes of this show... T.T
[10/13/18, 10:55:40 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @Flight_Devil Yikes, no. The Second Inquisition is out in full force. They've done a lot of damage so far.
[10/13/18, 10:55:40 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> right, see pst episodes with Alpha or Prime
[10/13/18, 10:55:40 AM] <knightly2u> @ExploringReal Come for the Talesin. Stay for the wonderful RP.
[10/13/18, 10:55:40 AM] <IntrovertDM> Welcome Critters - to our daddy goth territory
[10/13/18, 10:55:41 AM] <Flight_Devil> A tremie that's all about the goth scene, yeah!
[10/13/18, 10:55:42 AM] <RainbowArchwizardMatthew> I hope Taliesin is going to play Prince Vannevar
[10/13/18, 10:55:42 AM] <Damon_fyrian> I''m half hoping it's going to be one of the clans we haven't seen yet.
[10/13/18, 10:55:53 AM] <Dragonchrome> Taliesin is a guest Guest on Vampire The Masquerade : L.A. By Night https://twitter.com/GeekandSundry/status/1050475225039523840
[10/13/18, 10:55:54 AM] <That_One_Guy212> i just want to see if tal starts out at the table right away
[10/13/18, 10:56:01 AM] <krowwithabrush> @dani1688 besides himself you mean?
[10/13/18, 10:56:11 AM] <Crossive_> Tal could also play as one of their sires which would be interesting.
[10/13/18, 10:56:18 AM] <RPG_Nova> whoo
[10/13/18, 10:56:22 AM] <Dragonchrome> 4 misn warning
[10/13/18, 10:56:28 AM] <owifig> @bookity101 Okay, thanks
[10/13/18, 10:56:31 AM] <RPG_Nova> I think that is happening
[10/13/18, 10:56:32 AM] <bookity101> @lordmuffincakes do you amazon orime?
[10/13/18, 10:56:32 AM] <Gaming_Unplugged> Man.
[10/13/18, 10:56:32 AM] <Sylien_> I sure hope he's tremere, since that's what I feel is most me, but he might be Erika's sire, which would make him Brujah, which would also be cool. Or something third we haven't thought of!
[10/13/18, 10:56:38 AM] <Gaming_Unplugged> This is going to too much awesome.
[10/13/18, 10:56:38 AM] <RPG_Nova> they're probably a sire
[10/13/18, 10:56:42 AM] <That_One_Guy212> i hate that the good stuff is on the west coast
[10/13/18, 10:56:42 AM] <Damon_fyrian> I could totally see Tal being a Brujah or a Camarilla clan though.
[10/13/18, 10:56:45 AM] <spiritualsirene> I'm still super new to VtM but isn't having one of the Princes come after you most likely a not good thing?
[10/13/18, 10:56:50 AM] <Flight_Devil> Let us join the dark dance of the Masquerade.
[10/13/18, 10:56:51 AM] <flipflurpington> Maybe Tal is Victor's nemesis? They're going to the hotel tonight right?
[10/13/18, 10:56:55 AM] <DakuBara> So is it true we only get 8 episodes of LA by Night?

[10/13/18, 10:57:03 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> INB4 Tal makes a GRAND ENTRANCE
[10/13/18, 10:57:05 AM] <stubmytoeinthedark> I hear Talisen is in this episode. I can't wait to see!
[10/13/18, 10:57:08 AM] <That_One_Guy212> i have to stay up till like midnight or later and watch some cool shit
[10/13/18, 10:57:12 AM] <knightly2u> Dude Tal As a BRuja makes sense.. He loves Punk and goth.. Why not cross the streams?
[10/13/18, 10:57:14 AM] <Dragonchrome> yes @DakuBara , short but sweet
[10/13/18, 10:57:16 AM] <Damon_fyrian> @Deathstar_Taco When does he not?
[10/13/18, 10:57:17 AM] <RBGPlays> Tal looks... aggressive and sexy in the pic he and Erika took.
[10/13/18, 10:57:22 AM] <spiritualsirene> Same here @That_One_Guy212
[10/13/18, 10:57:26 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> All I know is.. there will be blood.
[10/13/18, 10:57:32 AM] <TDotTerror> Ohhhhhhhh, boy.
[10/13/18, 10:57:32 AM] <Decavolty> Tal is the sire isn't he
[10/13/18, 10:57:32 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @fringedwella Than Victor is dead
[10/13/18, 10:57:35 AM] <spiritualsirene> Thankfully I don't work saturdays
[10/13/18, 10:57:36 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @spiritualsirene A prince rarely bothers to come after you in person. They can, however, send everyone else against you.
[10/13/18, 10:57:37 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> ^,.,^
[10/13/18, 10:57:46 AM] <Flight_Devil> @dragonchrome Eh...Firefly proves not all things can be short and sweet.
[10/13/18, 10:57:46 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Taliesin will be a prince i think or a vampire version of the master and is here to ruin everything for everyone
[10/13/18, 10:57:47 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> nothing quite like a sure thing @Damon_fyrian
[10/13/18, 10:57:51 AM] <GreyAngel> My body is ready
[10/13/18, 10:57:52 AM] <That_One_Guy212> @spiritualsirene everyting is on one of the coasts and it hard to catch either one
[10/13/18, 10:57:53 AM] <hirumasummata> I'd like to see some Gangrel love :D
[10/13/18, 10:57:54 AM] <RemiRavenheart> O.O
[10/13/18, 10:57:55 AM] <smileygirlartist> Hello :)
[10/13/18, 10:57:57 AM] <Ferr0vax> @spiritualsirene Having a Prince/Baron after you in definitely not a good thing. Tends to go poorly, but they rarely show up in person.
[10/13/18, 10:57:58 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Tal will be debuting the all new pyramid class
[10/13/18, 10:57:58 AM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> Will Taliesin be playing as himself?

[10/13/18, 10:58:03 AM] <TDotTerror> If he isn't a Tremere, I'd be stunned.
[10/13/18, 10:58:07 AM] <JC_Wijma> @Alexanderhero83 Technically they are all dead. They are vampires after all.
[10/13/18, 10:58:08 AM] <anderfc> Tal is playing himself (CAIN)
[10/13/18, 10:58:11 AM] <jr_bob_loblaw> Princes have "sheriffs", at least one to enforce law
[10/13/18, 10:58:18 AM] <DakuBara> If we only have 8 episodes it means weâ€™re more then half way done with the series
