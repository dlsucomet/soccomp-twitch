[10/13/18, 11:06:48 AM] <MissNayoung> So we finally get to see the infamous Ramona in the flesh tonight.

[10/13/18, 11:07:09 AM] <krazyflower> The symbols are the clans each character is in
[10/13/18, 11:07:17 AM] <Gets_Caught> @Ferr0vax Ignore my last question, forgot Anna is Brujah haha
[10/13/18, 11:07:22 AM] <ChainsawGothic> The owl is *not what it seems.*

[10/13/18, 11:09:09 AM] <cinphoria> ...something just occurred to me. If Ramona could be a carrier pigeon, that means there can be live specimens of extinct animals
[10/13/18, 11:09:10 AM] <CraigOxbrow> That works, yay!
[10/13/18, 11:09:10 AM] <chaoticloony> @RandomRicker He will be here when it is right
