[10/18/18, 10:06:47 AM] <spiritualsirene> Because Taliesin is also blond, bisexual, and can do a british accent
[10/18/18, 10:06:51 AM] <ArisBranwin> Still waiting for the Constantine jacket to magically appear.

[10/18/18, 10:07:57 AM] <JodyHouser> My first-ever comic was the Marvel anti-smoking comic
[10/18/18, 10:07:57 AM] <joshhoodcomics> then it's step 1
[10/18/18, 10:07:58 AM] <tortugadelmar> Well it did give Constantine cancer at some point if I remember correctly...
[10/18/18, 10:08:01 AM] <Anachrontopian_Prime> Cigarettes = antihero or villain
[10/18/18, 10:08:05 AM] <ArisBranwin> Yeah and then his cancer was removed. Because plot.
[10/18/18, 10:08:06 AM] <cinphoria> I feel like we've already had several months of prequels leading up to this episode courtesy of Dani's twitter ;)

[10/18/18, 10:08:11 AM] <misssunflower94> QUESTION: Dani, what - outside of Constantine - got you into comics?

[10/18/18, 10:09:35 AM] <phoenixgoth> The Sorting Hat would just retire
[10/18/18, 10:09:36 AM] ** JeffM0307 has never smoked because most of his relatives were smoking at the time.
[10/18/18, 10:09:36 AM] <feathersflight> That's the fifth house: kicked out

[10/18/18, 10:10:09 AM] <HopefulNinja> John isn't ambitious enough for skytherin tbh. he doesn't give enough Fs
[10/18/18, 10:10:10 AM] <feathersflight> Smart people are the scariest

[10/18/18, 10:10:28 AM] <ladyamphy> I posted In the discord today my hellblazer story. Was at a podcast years ago with Paul Jenkins as a guest host. There were a lot of people who were there including Liam O'brien and Marv Wolfman. I knew Liam but had know idea what a big deal the other people there were.

[10/18/18, 10:11:33 AM] <Journeyman0186> There is the tragic flaw that his pursuit of knowledge is the beginning of his downfall; that's so Ravenclaw.

[10/18/18, 10:12:16 AM] <vaporlocke1981> #5minutetopic if the Constantine TV show had not been canceled, what story would you have wanted them to tackle. Bonus question; what cameo would you have wanted to see?
[10/18/18, 10:12:19 AM] <tatzelthess> TOPIC: You are the Sorting Hat and a bunch of comic book characters have been accepted into Hogwarts. Where do you sort them and how do they do in their new houses?
