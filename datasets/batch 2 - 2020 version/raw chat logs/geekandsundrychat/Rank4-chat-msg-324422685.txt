[10/19/18, 7:05:38 AM] <ArisBranwin> Because there are stories allegedly about ghosts supposedly having sex with people... but thats whole lore thing in that is in a book.

[10/19/18, 7:06:07 AM] <SiderealEX> That was the moment that Dan Ackroyd decided to spend his remaining days selling Crystal Skull Vodka.
