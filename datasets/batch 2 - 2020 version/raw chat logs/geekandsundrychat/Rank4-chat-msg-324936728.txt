[10/20/18, 11:05:37 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Metebelis777
[10/20/18, 11:05:44 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Hello, @Metebelis777
[10/20/18, 11:05:48 AM] <Stj1mmy> This game just starting guys?
[10/20/18, 11:05:52 AM] <geekielady> @JohnyZoo Yeah, it's made for smaller groups. It's a more intimate game, with heavy RP, so larger groups isn't really ideal.
[10/20/18, 11:05:56 AM] <Lord_Machiavellian> The advantage of being a Nosferatu is they tend to come and go as they please, so it fits into the story well
[10/20/18, 11:05:56 AM] <SeattleEgg> yup
[10/20/18, 11:05:58 AM] <taraquest> Maybe he will join in later in the show

[10/20/18, 11:06:07 AM] <TrainerJodie> @Darastrygat Was in crunch time finishing my Bachelor's Degree. I now have a BS in Marketing Management and a lot more free time, so the YouTube channel should be picking up soon hopefully
[10/20/18, 11:06:08 AM] <ChainsawGothic> @Metebelis777 I sense the presence of an old-school Whovian.
