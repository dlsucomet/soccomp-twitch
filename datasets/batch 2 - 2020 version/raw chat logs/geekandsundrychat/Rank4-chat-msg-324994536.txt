[10/20/18, 11:04:03 AM] <ExploringReal> Taliesin was the best
[10/20/18, 11:04:05 AM] <MissNayoung> October is a busy time of year for Alex.
[10/20/18, 11:04:11 AM] <geekielady> @JohnyZoo One of the players has a job he has to be gone for. Typically though, VtM games have fewer players than other tabletop RPGs.

[10/20/18, 11:05:44 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Hello, @Metebelis777
[10/20/18, 11:05:48 AM] <Stj1mmy> This game just starting guys?
[10/20/18, 11:05:52 AM] <geekielady> @JohnyZoo Yeah, it's made for smaller groups. It's a more intimate game, with heavy RP, so larger groups isn't really ideal.
[10/20/18, 11:05:56 AM] <Lord_Machiavellian> The advantage of being a Nosferatu is they tend to come and go as they please, so it fits into the story well
[10/20/18, 11:05:56 AM] <SeattleEgg> yup
[10/20/18, 11:05:58 AM] <taraquest> Maybe he will join in later in the show

[10/20/18, 11:06:24 AM] <highvoltage988> it's narratively convenient that Jasper keeps going through rough stuff on the weeks before Alex has to be out
