[10/24/18, 7:06:59 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> ramaO i would read this Book
[10/24/18, 7:07:04 AM] <Ossborn> @EricaTheStrange I would never buy a game this large as a download version

[10/24/18, 7:08:56 AM] <SpoilThat4You> Ugh why is everything good coming out lately? I only have so much time and I'm nowhere near finished with AC Odyssey
[10/24/18, 7:09:08 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Does this mean we can plan a space prison break?
[10/24/18, 7:09:18 AM] <SneakyIndigo> those morgan freeman impressions are uncanny
[10/24/18, 7:09:39 AM] <DJPheonyx> Somebody contact Wentworth Miller... he knows all about prison breaks
[10/24/18, 7:09:40 AM] <Gkgamerfan> that's a really creative way to handle toxic video game players
[10/24/18, 7:09:45 AM] <Ossborn> I havnt even started with Odyssey.... or Origins.... ofr finished Syndicate

[10/24/18, 7:10:53 AM] <shidareAKI> Omggggg Kevin
[10/24/18, 7:10:55 AM] <Zismarith> Memento: Put on pants. Put disks into packaging. Put letter in envelope.
[10/24/18, 7:10:57 AM] <darkofnate> Is this a sketch, or just Daryl's normal day?
[10/24/18, 7:10:58 AM] <JeffM0307> Just today?!

[10/24/18, 7:11:17 AM] <aleph_sharp> MOOD today Daryl. Asthma with a cough sucks
[10/24/18, 7:11:19 AM] <SneakyIndigo> hmm.. he seems a bit nervous.. just a bit
[10/24/18, 7:11:36 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> rama10 bit
[10/24/18, 7:11:36 AM] <shidareAKI> I love Daryl so much XDDD
[10/24/18, 7:11:38 AM] <Ossborn> Ships in AC,,,, UGH
[10/24/18, 7:12:17 AM] <gunheadx> ok I'm off, wish you all a good night cya all and have fun
[10/24/18, 7:12:24 AM] <EricaTheStrange> There are no cannons in Odyssey, it's all flaming arrows and javalins and ramming ships at full speed @Ossborn
[10/24/18, 7:12:30 AM] <gunheadx> gandsBeau
[10/24/18, 7:12:32 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> later gunheadx
[10/24/18, 7:12:39 AM] <derekleeketchum> i love these Game Engine stagers, but they're no Stager Danger
[10/24/18, 7:13:07 AM] <BeneficentlyIndifferent> Dev sweatshops.
[10/24/18, 7:13:12 AM] <shidareAKI> Crunch needs to be eliminated
[10/24/18, 7:13:34 AM] <MrNY2Cali> The Game Industry needs a UNION
[10/24/18, 7:13:36 AM] <NightowlDarsky> When people die for spending too many hours in front of a computer, it's a bit daft just for a game. But the release date back, if it's a good game, it wont hurt it. Look at GTAV.
[10/24/18, 7:13:54 AM] <FuffyButt> crunches, that reminds me. i have to work on my core
[10/24/18, 7:14:00 AM] <shidareAKI> Protect work life balance
[10/24/18, 7:14:10 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> I don't think it is worth it. If you need to crunch that hard I would rather a delay and make it look/work better than over stretch their staff.
[10/24/18, 7:14:22 AM] <lavrentivs> The results of bad planning
[10/24/18, 7:14:33 AM] <darkofnate> If you're working that many hours, you are NOT doing your best work. Overtime is necessary, but there needs to be a limit.
[10/24/18, 7:14:41 AM] <pandesaurus> @Ronin_Monkey you might want that, but shareholders dont. and guess who pays the bills?
[10/24/18, 7:14:45 AM] <KororoX> crunch is a failure of the management not an accomplishment of the workers
[10/24/18, 7:14:56 AM] <cinphoria> it's not all bad planning. a lot of it is just that you only have so long to not release a game or else you don't get enough revenue to pay your employees :/

[10/24/18, 7:15:12 AM] <NightowlDarsky> Over worked game creators, means mistakes, and patches, which they wok over time to make. :|
[10/24/18, 7:15:13 AM] <cinphoria> working for a software company, I get this dilemma
[10/24/18, 7:15:21 AM] <shidareAKI> Quality of work over quantity of hours. Karoshi is one of the main causes of death here in Japan
[10/24/18, 7:15:27 AM] <cinphoria> oomph
[10/24/18, 7:15:36 AM] <MrNY2Cali> No employee is "asked" to work long hours it's only strongly encouraged for future bonuses, project inclusions, etc
[10/24/18, 7:15:46 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> @pandesaurus I understand, but if you produce a bad product then it fails and the Shareholders are still loosing money. There is a balance that can be had.
[10/24/18, 7:16:08 AM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe
[10/24/18, 7:16:21 AM] <MrNY2Cali> At-Will Employee laws need some updating
[10/24/18, 7:16:27 AM] <darkofnate> When in reality, most of the temps will be laid off when the project is due...
[10/24/18, 7:16:29 AM] <NightowlDarsky> True.
[10/24/18, 7:16:33 AM] <darkofnate> *done
[10/24/18, 7:16:47 AM] <Enthusiamy> I love these two and this is so important.
[10/24/18, 7:16:52 AM] <shidareAKI> Union for devs!!

[10/24/18, 7:17:23 AM] <derekleeketchum> @enthusiamy agreed on both counts

[10/24/18, 7:17:34 AM] <jwslybfn> hi
[10/24/18, 7:17:39 AM] <cinphoria> Hi.
[10/24/18, 7:17:41 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> hi
[10/24/18, 7:17:45 AM] <darkofnate> I'm happy to work paid overtime at my job to get stuff done, but not at the levels they're talking about.
[10/24/18, 7:17:56 AM] <cinphoria> ^^^ yeah
[10/24/18, 7:18:04 AM] <baxorn> Postal Workers over the christmas season and holidays often have to pull 10 hour plus day shifts.
[10/24/18, 7:18:31 AM] <babygirl_myloves> ......
[10/24/18, 7:18:37 AM] <shidareAKI> Ugh gamers need to get a grip. The entitlement culture of gamers is ridiculous
[10/24/18, 7:18:43 AM] <EricaTheStrange> I've done that before @baxorn
[10/24/18, 7:18:49 AM] <MrNY2Cali> yea @darkofnate lots of game devs don't even get Paid Overtime
[10/24/18, 7:19:12 AM] <NightowlDarsky> It's also the rich getting richer, while the real workers get trod on.
[10/24/18, 7:19:19 AM] <shidareAKI> We are all excited to get new games but good games > rushed games
[10/24/18, 7:19:25 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Game Devs usually don't unionize because the industry is very fluid & there are a lot of transition betweet jobs
