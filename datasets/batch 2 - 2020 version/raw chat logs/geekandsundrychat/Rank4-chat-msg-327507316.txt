[10/26/18, 7:07:02 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Interesting
[10/26/18, 7:07:06 AM] <xxDominion> Please tell me they are talking about a Diablo MMO??
[10/26/18, 7:07:15 AM] <TheDiMono> Ryan rocking the trinity knot
[10/26/18, 7:08:12 AM] <roberttables> Diablo was SOooo my game back in the day
[10/26/18, 7:08:27 AM] <xxDominion> A
[10/26/18, 7:08:29 AM] <xxDominion> Agreed
[10/26/18, 7:08:32 AM] <roberttables> Hellfire expansion was incredible at the time
[10/26/18, 7:08:46 AM] <TheDiMono> Bovine armor was the shit

[10/26/18, 7:09:22 AM] <roberttables> D1 and D2 was so good for lore
[10/26/18, 7:09:22 AM] <Ozai75> @BlackOzzy87 Just like what you're doing. Ironic, eh?
[10/26/18, 7:09:37 AM] <sparksparksparks> they're currently just talking about diablo lore in general @xxDominion
[10/26/18, 7:09:42 AM] <ifritcast959> would saying doctor disrespect women be against rule 2?
[10/26/18, 7:09:44 AM] <Ronin_Monkey> @xxDominion looks like it is Diablo as a whole
[10/26/18, 7:09:47 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @xxDominion probably just Diablo lore in general
[10/26/18, 7:09:53 AM] <treskittle> They focused on the story in 3 but it was badly told and paced imo
[10/26/18, 7:10:12 AM] <xxDominion> Lol thank you all for answering.. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
