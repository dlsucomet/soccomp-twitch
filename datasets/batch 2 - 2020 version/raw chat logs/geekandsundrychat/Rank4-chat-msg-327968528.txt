[10/27/18, 11:02:32 AM] <pulpavenger> Has there been any talk of a second season in the works?

[10/27/18, 11:03:52 AM] <geminichild34> Aw Alex is out? He shall be missed
[10/27/18, 11:03:53 AM] <lukasblue7> I just saw him on All Work No Play
[10/27/18, 11:03:54 AM] <MagnusMalady> Jason?!?!
[10/27/18, 11:03:54 AM] <Vapor101> Oh cool! JCM! YEAh!
[10/27/18, 11:03:56 AM] <Hazgarn> Welp, if Jasper's not here that just means they have to give us another season, right?
[10/27/18, 11:03:57 AM] <Kr4sh3r> this core cast is great though
[10/27/18, 11:03:58 AM] <TheJerseyDriver> JCM tho.
[10/27/18, 11:04:00 AM] <omenatural> ah so sad to be missing him with so little left to go!
[10/27/18, 11:04:02 AM] <geminichild34> Awww...this will be god
[10/27/18, 11:04:04 AM] <geminichild34> good
[10/27/18, 11:04:06 AM] <Wulfa989> JCM!!!
[10/27/18, 11:04:07 AM] <dinosaurdice> To be clear, that was hype for Jason, not rage at lack of Alex
[10/27/18, 11:04:13 AM] <higgensbiggens> @ilikedeathmetal666 alex is a professional creature actor
[10/27/18, 11:04:16 AM] <FoxAndRaven> You're stealing that screen when the campaign ends, aren't you?
[10/27/18, 11:04:23 AM] <celestria129> JCM cool!
[10/27/18, 11:04:27 AM] <delta_fixxer> can we please have a tremere appear in game so we can see how their blood magic works now? D:
[10/27/18, 11:04:27 AM] <ColeHatter> Erika's got a table all to herself now
[10/27/18, 11:04:28 AM] <geminichild34> JCM...this shall be interesting..I will guess Gangrel
[10/27/18, 11:04:32 AM] <ArtemisRuse> @ilikedeathmetal666 hes a professional monster actor
[10/27/18, 11:04:34 AM] <ChaosS7v7n> @canaahawke no just bats like Ozzy.
[10/27/18, 11:04:34 AM] <thirt33nthstar> So cool!
[10/27/18, 11:05:00 AM] <messerach777> Anyone else seeing any glitchs on the video?
[10/27/18, 11:05:06 AM] <PhilosophyPlatypus> Let's tell a vampire story!
[10/27/18, 11:05:10 AM] <kol_ceridwen> Annebelle moved on up. Victor might have the Valley, but she's got a whole side of the table, lol
[10/27/18, 11:05:10 AM] <anderfc> Some red coverings on the lamps would be neat
[10/27/18, 11:05:13 AM] <Vapor101> Yeah its rough.. we all Miss Jasper, but they are getting great guests too!
[10/27/18, 11:05:17 AM] <SnowHermit> No glitches here
[10/27/18, 11:05:18 AM] <KitZunekaze> @delta_fixxer Nelli G has Blood Sorcery disciplines, and a blood ritual was seen in episode 1
[10/27/18, 11:05:30 AM] <anderfc> @messerach777 U need to F5
[10/27/18, 11:05:30 AM] <palehorn23> dang I missed some of the beginning
[10/27/18, 11:05:32 AM] <superratlord> my headphones still haven't recovered from erikas scream last week.
[10/27/18, 11:05:37 AM] <CaptianTrips88> Rest if Final Death Nick
[10/27/18, 11:05:52 AM] <Losile> Yeeee Nellie <3
[10/27/18, 11:06:05 AM] <Mortal_Player> the night returns
[10/27/18, 11:06:07 AM] <higgensbiggens> wonder if nick will show back up as a wraith
[10/27/18, 11:06:10 AM] <anderfc> Blaine Gang
[10/27/18, 11:06:21 AM] <Flight_Devil> Anyone think that female hunter got turned into a Vampire
[10/27/18, 11:06:25 AM] <palehorn23> it didn't update
[10/27/18, 11:06:36 AM] <dinosaurdice> Shit's gettin real, y'all
[10/27/18, 11:06:37 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> cheer200
[10/27/18, 11:06:47 AM] <TheDiMono> I'm predicting JCM as Bobby Blaine. Just putting that out there now
[10/27/18, 11:06:48 AM] <GeekandSundry> Very real @dinosaurdice
[10/27/18, 11:06:49 AM] <fussybucket> HYPE
[10/27/18, 11:06:49 AM] <anderfc> She got turned into a dead body
[10/27/18, 11:07:00 AM] <CaptianTrips88> if you're not seeing show, just keep refreshing
[10/27/18, 11:07:06 AM] <GalanorBrighteye> Hope Jasper's back next week. But I'm glad that Alex has some cool stuff lined up!
[10/27/18, 11:07:09 AM] <CaptianTrips88> it's very much on now
[10/27/18, 11:07:09 AM] <Flight_Devil> Oh, hi. @geekandsundry
[10/27/18, 11:07:14 AM] <knightly2u> Sooo there are toomany loose ends with this? Anyone else thinking season 2?
[10/27/18, 11:07:18 AM] <Stj1mmy> @Flight_Devil Didn't they both die? One got killed, other was left in fire since VampButler wouldn't let secretary take it.
[10/27/18, 11:07:18 AM] <Ozzie_bloke1> cheer1 cheer1 cheer1 cheer1
[10/27/18, 11:07:20 AM] <kol_ceridwen> @KitZunekaze @delta_fixxer there was also the Tremere npc in Ep1 as well. Path of Blood is basically now combined with Quietus for alternate powers(big plus imo), and the rituals look the same. Just not as much because the corebook is more new player friendly than say, V20 was.(V20 was scary big imo as a recent convert)
[10/27/18, 11:07:21 AM] <GeekandSundry> @GalanorBrighteye we feel the same way
[10/27/18, 11:07:25 AM] <kam1nokiri> She is nothing but ash and dust now
[10/27/18, 11:07:28 AM] <shepahotep> I'm betting he's a Nosferatu to guide them through the underground.
[10/27/18, 11:07:32 AM] <highvoltage988> did y'all see on Alex's twitter that he played Count Nosferatu himself on Spongebob of all places? So cool
[10/27/18, 11:07:46 AM] ** strous1 preforms the collection ritual.
[10/27/18, 11:07:46 AM] <orlliie> too many questions and not enough answers we need a season 2
[10/27/18, 11:07:52 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @Rohane Congrats!
[10/27/18, 11:07:53 AM] <GalanorBrighteye> @GeekandSundry <3
[10/27/18, 11:07:57 AM] <Vapor101> I never got to play much VTM but this is so cool.
[10/27/18, 11:07:58 AM] <Ceturban> is there anywhere i can watch the older episodes of this???
[10/27/18, 11:08:05 AM] <Flight_Devil> @stj1mmy Nope. Victor let the secretary chick take the female huntress as a gift.
[10/27/18, 11:08:10 AM] <cwol101> shame this is running during Alex's busiest time of year
[10/27/18, 11:08:10 AM] <Rohane> Thank you @TheOnyxPath

[10/27/18, 11:08:35 AM] <Kr4sh3r> They shouldn't have killed the Gangrel that knew the location of the Labyrinth
[10/27/18, 11:08:35 AM] <TheOnyxPath> @Ceturban If you're a G&S or Alpha subscriber, you can watch them VoD. Otherwise G&S's Twitch does reruns through the week.
[10/27/18, 11:08:38 AM] <highvoltage988> @Ceturban VODs are available to subs. I believe it was said episodes will be on Youtube "eventually"
[10/27/18, 11:08:41 AM] <GeekandSundry> @cwol101 annoyingly Alex is so good at his job he doesn't really have downtime anymore
[10/27/18, 11:08:44 AM] <kol_ceridwen> @Flight_Devil Yeah, but Lamb wouldn't let her take her new childe so she was left behind in the fire
[10/27/18, 11:08:47 AM] <Stj1mmy> @Flight_Devil I recall that, but I remember since Miranda told the vampire guard to watch them two in the basement, he wouldn't let the secretary take the girl when the place was burning down since he wasn't "allowed" and they didn't have time to ask.
[10/27/18, 11:08:49 AM] <shidareAKI> Mods on top of it
[10/27/18, 11:08:50 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> @Ceturban Currently VODs, but they're sub-only. It will eventually be on youtube.
[10/27/18, 11:08:51 AM] <palehorn23> who did nelly g kill was it Annabelle sire
[10/27/18, 11:09:11 AM] <xdemelza> yay i am on time tonight!
[10/27/18, 11:09:11 AM] <shidareAKI> It was Nick
[10/27/18, 11:09:11 AM] <shepahotep> @palehorn23 Nick the Nosferatu
[10/27/18, 11:09:14 AM] <highvoltage988> @palehorn23 no, her murderer, Nick
[10/27/18, 11:09:15 AM] <TheDiMono> @palehorn23 It was Annabelle's killer when she was kin, Nick
[10/27/18, 11:09:19 AM] <Ceturban> aight thanks guys
[10/27/18, 11:09:20 AM] <cinphoria> Alex is too successful for this game and I'm totally mad at him :3c Really I'm very happy for him
[10/27/18, 11:09:21 AM] <KitZunekaze> @palehorn23 Nelli killed Nick, a nosferatu
[10/27/18, 11:09:23 AM] <Rats808> @palehorn23 Nick, the vamp who killed her; Carver was the one who Embraced her
[10/27/18, 11:09:29 AM] <cwol101> @GeekandSundry happy for him, sucks for us!
[10/27/18, 11:10:03 AM] <Flight_Devil> @stj1mmy Hm. I guess I need to go back and confirm that.
[10/27/18, 11:10:04 AM] <chaoticloony> Her humanity
[10/27/18, 11:10:13 AM] <anderfc> UNlife
[10/27/18, 11:10:28 AM] <Stj1mmy> VampMom kicking bird out of nest.
[10/27/18, 11:10:29 AM] <shepahotep> I'm convinced Nelli G's going to be the only survivor
[10/27/18, 11:10:33 AM] <TheDiMono> @Flight_Devil After the gift was given, Satine said "Lamb wouldn't let her leave" and he didn't
[10/27/18, 11:10:38 AM] <highvoltage988> is Alex just busier with creature work in Spooktober or is this just coincidence?
[10/27/18, 11:10:41 AM] <CaptianTrips88> Yarrrgh, you ARE THEM Annabelle
[10/27/18, 11:10:42 AM] <the_pale_lord> Good evening everyone
[10/27/18, 11:10:47 AM] <SnowHermit> Annabelle is so annoyingly idealistic
[10/27/18, 11:10:54 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @the_pale_lord
[10/27/18, 11:10:57 AM] <Flight_Devil> @thedimono Really? Okay.
[10/27/18, 11:10:58 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Hello, @the_pale_lord
[10/27/18, 11:11:14 AM] <CaptianTrips88> C'est ls Burjah
[10/27/18, 11:11:16 AM] <Stj1mmy> @HatefulJerk Tears incoming in 3...2...
[10/27/18, 11:11:18 AM] <KitZunekaze> Annabella is a consentualist, so she likely still has a humanity of 8
[10/27/18, 11:11:21 AM] <palehorn23> Brujah were always suppose to have that annoying idealusm
[10/27/18, 11:11:23 AM] <Ossborn> In the end. it´s quite simple... dont hire Alex Ward for a Twitch show around Halloween ^^
[10/27/18, 11:11:29 AM] <kam1nokiri> Annabelle is still young. She’s still holding on to her last vestiges of her humanity
[10/27/18, 11:11:30 AM] <Flight_Devil> @hatefuljerk Considering that she's been recently turned, it makes sense.
[10/27/18, 11:11:30 AM] <houseiandi> @shepahotep Really? I fell like Victor is more likely. That dude is all about self preservation.
[10/27/18, 11:11:37 AM] <Metebelis777> high humanity new vamp vs pragmatic tory
[10/27/18, 11:11:50 AM] <SnowHermit> Oh, totally. I'm not complaining. I love that about her character
[10/27/18, 11:12:14 AM] <CaptianTrips88> It's the young Brujah that you have to worry about
[10/27/18, 11:12:16 AM] <highvoltage988> @HatefulJerk same. It's the perfect representation of "personal horror" that the game is meant for
[10/27/18, 11:12:25 AM] <Hazgarn> Isn't Nellie also a diablerist?
[10/27/18, 11:12:28 AM] <CaptianTrips88> eventually they learn. Maybe
[10/27/18, 11:12:37 AM] <Stj1mmy> @Hazgarn Yes
[10/27/18, 11:12:38 AM] <GreenOrGoHome> I think pragmatism is a learnt behaviour of the decades. It shows the grind of time against the soul
[10/27/18, 11:12:41 AM] <Metebelis777> anna needs to meet at tzi, might change outlook a bit
[10/27/18, 11:12:44 AM] <shepahotep> @houseiandi Nah. I think Victor will overreach and maybe let pride get the best of him. Jasper is going to try and reclaim/hold onto his humanity. Annabelle's going to Annabelle. Nelli G will kill her way to an exit and spider climb her way to feed again another day.
[10/27/18, 11:12:49 AM] <kam1nokiri> They learn or they die.
[10/27/18, 11:12:50 AM] <Rats808> yeah, Nelli diablerized her sire's other childe
[10/27/18, 11:12:50 AM] <strous1> The world is a dog eat dog world. Kill or be killed.
[10/27/18, 11:12:58 AM] <Flight_Devil> I mean, I think it makes sense that Anna isn't totally onboard with sucking out people's blood til they die.
[10/27/18, 11:13:01 AM] <CaptianTrips88> allegedly Hazgarn
[10/27/18, 11:13:03 AM] <WoodenMonkeyGod> Rhetoric?
[10/27/18, 11:13:12 AM] <KitZunekaze> Hahah yeah, Meeting the Tzimisce has a way of changing your perception of reality
[10/27/18, 11:13:24 AM] <cinphoria> Annabelle is young in the vampire sense, but she's also VERY young in the human sense too
[10/27/18, 11:13:37 AM] <akhenatron> it's a doggie dog world
[10/27/18, 11:13:37 AM] <cinphoria> Oh Belle <3
[10/27/18, 11:13:39 AM] <TheDiMono> I think Annabelle is only 19
[10/27/18, 11:13:40 AM] <Flight_Devil> If she were, I'm sure Nellie and the rest would have killed her on the spot.
[10/27/18, 11:13:42 AM] <SniperWriter> Abuse? In my vampire relationship? It's more likely than you think

[10/27/18, 11:14:30 AM] <SniperWriter> I always knew Chaz played Renegade Kappa
[10/27/18, 11:14:33 AM] <houseiandi> @shepahotep I definitely agree that pride could bite Victor in the ass. And Jasper and Annabelle are almost certainly doomed. I think Nelli's pride could also be her downfall though. That whole scene with whatshisface last week - she couldn't let it go.
[10/27/18, 11:14:35 AM] <akhenatron> @shidareAKI lol yes. that's the joke ;)

[10/27/18, 11:15:46 AM] <missunreason> @azuloit They're driving towards Jasper's hiding place, Annabelle asked Nelli why she killed Nick. Discussion ensued.
