[11/1/18, 10:04:23 AM] <stargazer1977> I'm not a big fan of the guest, strongly disagree with some of her views, but trying to keep an open mind and just enjoy the show. Sometimes people you disagree with can still provide valuable insight on something you like.
[11/1/18, 10:04:25 AM] <phoenixgoth> @ravonlocke I was writing something with a friend and we got so into it that we accidentally hit the NaNo limit in like a week.

[11/1/18, 10:05:30 AM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> Taliesin better sleep.
[11/1/18, 10:05:31 AM] <phoenixgoth> @miriamkey Hi MomKey! :D Hope Texas is treating you well!
[11/1/18, 10:05:40 AM] <Lord_Machiavellian> The true reason Taliesin can't be here is he has to perform several ancient rites to keep the spirits of old in harmony
[11/1/18, 10:05:44 AM] <Danoba> Hey @miriamkey
[11/1/18, 10:05:47 AM] <tatzelthess> what's Amy's outfit?

[11/1/18, 10:06:03 AM] <cinphoria> @fableseason he'd never make it to the studio then :P
[11/1/18, 10:06:08 AM] <starpilotsix> Locke and Key without Matt Key last week, and Demonology without Tal this week.
[11/1/18, 10:06:11 AM] <chaoticloony> @fableseason So he will never be allowed back
[11/1/18, 10:06:12 AM] <owifig> That's a FANTASTIC Wonder Woman costume, but mad respect for Amy's comfy halloween too
[11/1/18, 10:06:13 AM] <phoenixgoth> Markeia looks *great*
[11/1/18, 10:06:16 AM] <misssunflower94> Yes Matt Key work for us
[11/1/18, 10:06:18 AM] <sunlitlake> @tatzelthess -- she's Hank McCoy! The onsie they had made about a year ago?
[11/1/18, 10:06:23 AM] <RMutt1917> @tatzelthess its a Hank McCoy/Beast kigurumi
[11/1/18, 10:06:24 AM] <KaiOrAya> I think that's her Beast kigu
[11/1/18, 10:06:26 AM] <RuzgofDI> Says you, Key!
[11/1/18, 10:06:30 AM] <mixyourfeelings> Hi
[11/1/18, 10:06:32 AM] <feathersflight> That look works on Matt. He looks slightly evil.
[11/1/18, 10:06:33 AM] <KBTibbs> The first rule of demons is... maybe try stamp collecting instead
[11/1/18, 10:06:34 AM] <GarthMcMurray> Please talk about The Demon Etrigan, especially the Garth Ennis & John McCrea run
[11/1/18, 10:06:36 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @mfsky
[11/1/18, 10:06:40 AM] <phoenixgoth> I love that the beast kigu is so BIG on Amy that his "belt" is around her thighs.
[11/1/18, 10:06:43 AM] <JeffM0307> Uri Gellerian? :P
[11/1/18, 10:06:46 AM] <misssunflower94> Have You Heard the News of Our Good Lord Dormamu
[11/1/18, 10:06:47 AM] <cinphoria> hey mfsky
[11/1/18, 10:06:48 AM] <ArisBranwin> I'm waiting for an Evangelion deep dive...
[11/1/18, 10:06:48 AM] <Smarcey> Eva is great
[11/1/18, 10:06:52 AM] <sunlitlake> All words to describe the Wednesdaisies at MCM
[11/1/18, 10:06:52 AM] <cinphoria> YAY ETYMOLOGY
[11/1/18, 10:06:55 AM] <sp_acevex> matt key is the most valid person ever
[11/1/18, 10:06:57 AM] <ShandraVdeG> Why I love Matt Key
[11/1/18, 10:07:01 AM] <KaiOrAya> <--- heard Evangelion and autofilled the Neon Genesis part
[11/1/18, 10:07:03 AM] <misssunflower94> Have You Accepted Dormamu as Your Lord and Savior
[11/1/18, 10:07:05 AM] <herladykrow> All hallows eve
[11/1/18, 10:07:11 AM] <stargazer1977> Yes... yes, people do want to get into worshiping demons. Or what Abrahamic cultists consider demons, which were the deities from other religions they disagreed with.
[11/1/18, 10:07:14 AM] <misssunflower94> yea it's All Hallows Eve
[11/1/18, 10:07:16 AM] <prairiequeer> As someone IN seminary I've always wanted to talk theology in comics with Matt
[11/1/18, 10:07:20 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> Come for the comics, stay for the surprise!etymology content
[11/1/18, 10:07:25 AM] <RMutt1917> LUL I was just watching the Halloween ep of DC daily with Markeia in that same costume
[11/1/18, 10:07:26 AM] <akhenatron> hallow is something held as holy
[11/1/18, 10:07:27 AM] <Capefoxalix> hallow is a blessing right?
[11/1/18, 10:07:28 AM] <AromiaFlyce> What about Khorne?
[11/1/18, 10:07:34 AM] <Shadowsoflife> @cinphoria Yeah Etymology
[11/1/18, 10:07:34 AM] <cinphoria> I love how Matt put on his serious professor glasses to professor at us
[11/1/18, 10:07:34 AM] <ArisBranwin> I suddenly heard Shinji screaming somewhere...
[11/1/18, 10:07:36 AM] <LuluTheGamingArtist> Hail and well met, travellers!
[11/1/18, 10:07:38 AM] <101deadpool1017> This is like Elseworld Father Key
[11/1/18, 10:07:47 AM] <misssunflower94> Hallow is holy or blessed
[11/1/18, 10:07:49 AM] <chaoticloony> I play D&D, so i must be a demon worshiper! :)
[11/1/18, 10:07:52 AM] <cinphoria> PANTS THE DEVIL! \o/
[11/1/18, 10:07:57 AM] <stargazer1977> Baal and Asteroth were very worshiped gods, and Ishtar was slandered almost more than anyone else in that book of mythology known as the Bible.
[11/1/18, 10:08:01 AM] <bskrueger> this channel turned into access evangelical television so quickly
[11/1/18, 10:08:07 AM] <super390> Jesus is a trickster cleric
[11/1/18, 10:08:09 AM] <JeffM0307> I didn't know the devil wore pants
[11/1/18, 10:08:14 AM] <giljaxon> no this is awesome
[11/1/18, 10:08:15 AM] <crthemighty> always pants a devil when given a chance
[11/1/18, 10:08:15 AM] <feathersflight> Jesus pantsed the devil. That is way more interesting than religion usually is
[11/1/18, 10:08:19 AM] <beefyloot> sheriffWOT
[11/1/18, 10:08:24 AM] <ArisBranwin> I read Paradise Lost... e.e;
[11/1/18, 10:08:25 AM] <prairiequeer> there isn't
[11/1/18, 10:08:29 AM] <misssunflower94> I'm here for this theology
[11/1/18, 10:08:30 AM] <sunlitlake> omg jesus fanon
[11/1/18, 10:08:34 AM] <GarthMcMurray> The Matt Key to Hell?
[11/1/18, 10:08:35 AM] <runningfool11> since tomorrow is All Saints Day, and today is considered All Hallows Eve, and something hallowed is "sacred" I am going to guess that the in question Hallowed thing would be a saint.
[11/1/18, 10:08:40 AM] <LilyRose28> oh no please don't
[11/1/18, 10:08:43 AM] <llamacorn_misanthropy> the fact that Matt's wearing a Preacher outfit makes the conversation all the more entertaining
[11/1/18, 10:08:43 AM] <nerdstroms> TOPIC: Which superhero/villain would have the MOST EPIC Halloween destination for trick or treaters. Describe their house (or lair) and what tricks or treats they would have ready for their guests.
[11/1/18, 10:08:45 AM] <pitrPatR> Clean Room has demons, right? It's been a while since I read it.
[11/1/18, 10:08:54 AM] <herladykrow> Dani is screaming right now
[11/1/18, 10:08:57 AM] <cinphoria> I'm so totally here for Theological History With Matt Key
[11/1/18, 10:08:57 AM] <FuffyButt> i remember how jesus distracted all the demons by giving them fun size candy bars
[11/1/18, 10:09:06 AM] <stargazer1977> The Divine Comedy and Paradise Lost have become almost more canon than the actual Bible is about all things hell and Lucifer.
[11/1/18, 10:09:09 AM] <LordkingGobbler> lol John Wick cuz its also Keanu Reeves
[11/1/18, 10:09:13 AM] <BaconSupport> Constantine is John Wick.
