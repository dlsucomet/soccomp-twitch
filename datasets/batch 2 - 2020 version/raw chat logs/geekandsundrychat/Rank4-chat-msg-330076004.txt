[11/1/18, 12:38:42 PM] <chaoticloony> @Marb04 She said she did
[11/1/18, 12:38:42 PM] <Critternation3000> @marb04 probably not
[11/1/18, 12:38:45 PM] <akhenatron> good question @Marb04
[11/1/18, 12:39:03 PM] <Zismarith> If she stays still, the tree branch in the window behind her makes Amy look like maybe she's gonna cross-class Ranger or Druid.
[11/1/18, 12:39:36 PM] <CinderFlame> All righty, home safe and more or less sound, at least physically....

[11/1/18, 12:41:36 PM] <CinderFlame> I get to have a tooth pulled tomorrow afternoon, and I am sure that my dentist is going to make a Halloween joke about it...
[11/1/18, 12:41:39 PM] <Zismarith> @akhenatron I assumed that it was a thing. #theyknow
[11/1/18, 12:42:16 PM] <chaoticloony> @CinderFlame Surely he won't comment on you having a Sweet Tooth.
