[11/3/18, 7:02:01 AM] <sunlitlake> I voted Yes, because of my morals. I simply couldn't bring myself to say No? But NARRATIVELY I think No will be the most interesting.

[11/3/18, 7:02:17 AM] <DokeDokes> morally the answer is yes but the comic nerd in me sees this as when Lex Luthor became president and I want to see kylen have that other power to a harder struggle on the heros

[11/3/18, 7:07:12 AM] <SnowHermit> It's insanely expensive
[11/3/18, 7:07:13 AM] <darkofnate> Argh, why can't we have castles on the east US coast!?
[11/3/18, 7:07:15 AM] <philbe63> Taliesin doesn't need to do D&D in a castle since he actually was born in the middle ages and lived it for real!
[11/3/18, 7:07:25 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @ArisBranwin same though i have several systems i want to run including one free one called And the beat played on wich is a home brew that is very open ended
[11/3/18, 7:07:26 AM] <complainthat> yay! hype!
[11/3/18, 7:07:26 AM] <Henchman2121> Is Taliesin playing or did he just appear to bend reality in an effort to vex the cast and crew until they trick him into saying his name backwards?
[11/3/18, 7:07:30 AM] <shidareAKI> I wish I could too. It’s a pretty expensive trip but I hope that whoever goes has a great time!

[11/3/18, 7:07:45 AM] <complainthat> tal IS the castle
[11/3/18, 7:07:49 AM] <starpilotsix> @philbe63 Of course, they didn't have D&D back then. He played Pyramids & Pharoahs.
[11/3/18, 7:07:55 AM] <sunlitlake> That was a GREAT game btw
