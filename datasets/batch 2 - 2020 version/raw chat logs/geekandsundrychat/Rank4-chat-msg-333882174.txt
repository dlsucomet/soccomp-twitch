[11/10/18, 8:07:17 AM] <chroma_in_blue> it is such a vivid game
[11/10/18, 8:07:28 AM] <onlyonemorechapter> that was beautiful
[11/10/18, 8:07:29 AM] <mattmccullar> the art is gorgeous
[11/10/18, 8:07:37 AM] <raemondf> @seratonia why do you have a stapler?
[11/10/18, 8:07:38 AM] <Territan> Now wondering if they commissioned the same artist for the character art.
[11/10/18, 8:07:39 AM] <RJLadyA> @jkoking thank you someone had to say it!
[11/10/18, 8:07:39 AM] <Unit2Bear> we love this whole game's aesthetic
[11/10/18, 8:07:43 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> It was awesome!

[11/10/18, 8:08:10 AM] <CaptainTalon447> I hope this isn’t a case where the game is all flash and no substance
[11/10/18, 8:08:13 AM] <chroma_in_blue> pretty much
[11/10/18, 8:08:20 AM] <bluelinnet> @raemondf you will get a stapler in 3 months
[11/10/18, 8:08:20 AM] <Territan> Safety tip: Don't futz with the Novapendra.

[11/10/18, 8:09:11 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @16bitEric acctually YEA thats a really on the nose description
[11/10/18, 8:09:12 AM] <akhenatron> @16bitEric I mean, that's Dark Crystal.
[11/10/18, 8:09:21 AM] <Unit2Bear> Dark Crystal definitely. also stuff like Baten Kaitos\Xenoblade etc.
[11/10/18, 8:09:36 AM] <philbe63> World of Tiers?
[11/10/18, 8:09:41 AM] <darkofnate> Yeah, Dark Crystal or Labyrinth...

[11/10/18, 8:12:05 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I....kinda feel like the players should have introduced themselves.
