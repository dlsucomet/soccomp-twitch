[11/29/18, 11:05:42 AM] <GarthMcMurray> I'd like to recommend an old webcomic I was part of that ended years ago. One artist would do one strip, then hand off to another artist, and so on. Many of the artists went on to draw mainstream print comics for Marvel, DC, etc. It's Wrestling Theatre at Grab Bag Comics
[11/29/18, 11:05:44 AM] <CromThePale> I do hope they cover Looking for Group, it is a fantastic web comic.
