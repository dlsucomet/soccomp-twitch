[11/30/18, 7:56:16 AM] <Salty_Seven> Yeah the fire wall makes it very hard to make up an excuse
[11/30/18, 7:56:23 AM] <GracefulGracie> Expect for Clay.
[11/30/18, 7:56:29 AM] <synfinity79> ah but if its a distractions its between them and the crew they have time and no vision on them to ditch the journal
[11/30/18, 7:56:31 AM] <lordyoloswag69> lol what is lore masters
[11/30/18, 7:56:47 AM] <GracefulGracie> Aside from that, the fire wall can easily sink them in seconds or be put out with Avantika's power.
[11/30/18, 7:56:54 AM] <lordyoloswag69> are we down to 3 hours till start time?
[11/30/18, 7:57:08 AM] <GracefulGracie> Ditching the journal won't help them whatsoever.
[11/30/18, 7:57:19 AM] <GracefulGracie> At least right now.
[11/30/18, 7:57:21 AM] <drpockystick> The person who cast locate object already knows where its at. They've been made and have to fight or run

[11/30/18, 7:58:48 AM] <Andyinsomnia> jcvimHi all
[11/30/18, 7:58:53 AM] <GracefulGracie> Lol yes xD
[11/30/18, 7:58:54 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Andyinsomnia
[11/30/18, 7:59:02 AM] <lordyoloswag69> I just caught up about a month ago. ITS SO HARD TO WAIT FOR NEW EPISODES ON CLIFF HANGERS LIKE THESE
[11/30/18, 7:59:09 AM] <Ossborn> thuluHEY @Andyinsomnia
[11/30/18, 7:59:23 AM] <TroubledPitcher> first live episode
[11/30/18, 7:59:23 AM] <GracefulGracie> Caleb killed me. I wish he wouldn't have done the fire wall!
[11/30/18, 7:59:41 AM] <lordyoloswag69> like this last episode might be the most cliff hanger episode ever
[11/30/18, 8:00:06 AM] <nightowl_tbh> I agree, also good day people ^^
[11/30/18, 8:00:06 AM] <GracefulGracie> Yep. That's why I *had* to come to this livestream tonight.
[11/30/18, 8:00:12 AM] <Salty_Seven> Caleb did what anyone that wanted to protect his friends would do
[11/30/18, 8:00:14 AM] <GracefulGracie> I couldn't bare to wait for Monday.
[11/30/18, 8:00:16 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @nightowl_tbh
[11/30/18, 8:00:24 AM] <lordyoloswag69> lol its very possible caleb caused a few character deaths here. matt seems a lot less merciful this campaign
[11/30/18, 8:00:35 AM] <GracefulGracie> I know I just feel like it was sort of hasty. Like, they're on an island? Where will they go?
[11/30/18, 8:01:00 AM] <nightowl_tbh> I had to catch up on the YouTube playlist since last time I tried to attend a live stream I fell asleep in the first twenty minutes >(
[11/30/18, 8:01:03 AM] <Salty_Seven> They will kill everyone and leave with the mystake
[11/30/18, 8:01:12 AM] <burritopug> i'm getting a black screen and no audio either\
[11/30/18, 8:01:14 AM] <burritopug> anyone else?
[11/30/18, 8:01:23 AM] <GracefulGracie> But to be honest they should have ditched and hid the journal and jewels somewhere else and then retrieved them later if possible.
[11/30/18, 8:01:28 AM] <lordyoloswag69> honestly though, it's not liams fault. they all kinda messed up when they were late and tired. they had this dope plan to go to the plank king with this evidence and then they just didn't lol
[11/30/18, 8:01:31 AM] <nightowl_tbh> Re-start stream?
[11/30/18, 8:01:35 AM] <GracefulGracie> I'm on the events tab so idk.
[11/30/18, 8:01:59 AM] <Ossborn> @burritopug Try refreshing, the titlecard is up
[11/30/18, 8:02:22 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Yay!!!
[11/30/18, 8:02:30 AM] <Zismarith> gandsDick gandsLore gandsHecBird
[11/30/18, 8:02:31 AM] <GracefulGracie> I know it's just...worrisome? Like even without the spell they could've searched Jester's haversack just as easily.
[11/30/18, 8:02:44 AM] <Fluffy_Dutch_Guy> im so excited for tonights episode
[11/30/18, 8:02:46 AM] <Andyinsomnia> https://twitter.com/HydroSnail
[11/30/18, 8:02:48 AM] <GracefulGracie> They knew what they were looking for, and/or could've just dumped it upside down.
[11/30/18, 8:02:50 AM] <drpockystick> No idea where things are going to go from here
[11/30/18, 8:02:52 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Aww, hope he feels better soon!
