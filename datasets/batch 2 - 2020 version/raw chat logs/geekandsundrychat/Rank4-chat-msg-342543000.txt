[11/30/18, 8:08:17 AM] <Zismarith> Or he rests. For the coming hour.
[11/30/18, 8:08:23 AM] <Andyinsomnia> To paraphrase myself in another twitch chat a few weeks ago "Lovecraft was the real ancien horror"
[11/30/18, 8:08:41 AM] <Andyinsomnia> *ancient
[11/30/18, 8:08:42 AM] <chaoticloony> @Andyinsomnia 1000 points for that
[11/30/18, 8:08:44 AM] <steelneko> Lovecraft was suuuuper racist. Even the name he gave his beloved cat is utterly repulsive.
[11/30/18, 8:08:44 AM] <starpilotsix> Lovecraft wasn't just racist in the way a lot of people in his time were racist, he was pretty racist for his time too.
[11/30/18, 8:08:52 AM] <strous1> Ahh. The 80's when it became acceptable to play RPG's, and those of use who started in the 70's were shunned. :(
[11/30/18, 8:09:04 AM] <lordyoloswag69> who is the biggest bad in GOO universe? Is there any publishd lovecraft material related to DnD/
[11/30/18, 8:09:10 AM] <TheFootKnight> @Ossborn I see that callofcthulu emote. Adam is cool.
[11/30/18, 8:09:27 AM] <chaoticloony> @strous1 I started in 82, and know that feeling
[11/30/18, 8:09:48 AM] <Ossborn> @TheFootKnight One of my longest subscriptions, only my G&S and AnnaGeeks subs are longer ^^
[11/30/18, 8:10:19 AM] <Pervon> 1 yr sub badge better than 2 & 3 yr badge? big if true
[11/30/18, 8:10:23 AM] <lordyoloswag69> lolololol just googled that cat name wowww
[11/30/18, 8:10:34 AM] <TheFootKnight> @Ossborn Nice. He's a really nice guy. Really has a way with words that I haven't seen anyone else come close to.
[11/30/18, 8:10:40 AM] <Zismarith> Klatu, barada, nicHRMaftmba.
[11/30/18, 8:10:46 AM] <lordyoloswag69> I lost my sub badge because I subbed to league of legends for a free skin sad
[11/30/18, 8:11:02 AM] <Ossborn> He had his 1000th stream just last saturday
[11/30/18, 8:11:13 AM] <steelneko> @lordyoloswag69 Yeaaaaaah, it's worse than you could possibly imagine. gandsPencil gandsSpoopy
[11/30/18, 8:11:23 AM] ** strous1 understands it carried over early 80's
[11/30/18, 8:11:33 AM] <TheFootKnight> Oh really? I should go say hi again at some point..
[11/30/18, 8:11:34 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Yeah, if you want to get into this stuff you definitely have to separate the work from its creator. XD
[11/30/18, 8:11:46 AM] <Ossborn> He waits for you, beneath the fathoms
[11/30/18, 8:11:58 AM] <chaoticloony> Cthulhu was a presidential candidate
[11/30/18, 8:12:28 AM] <TheFootKnight> Such a good sub callout.
[11/30/18, 8:12:42 AM] <swJ0k3r> Cthulhu won the presidency
[11/30/18, 8:13:03 AM] <FuffyButt> Cthulhu can't be president. it wasn't born in America
[11/30/18, 8:13:09 AM] <chaoticloony> @swJ0k3r Nope, a lesser evil won
[11/30/18, 8:13:20 AM] <MagusGalzu> thats scary ,its aready a no win election, for normal people
[11/30/18, 8:13:38 AM] <Ossborn> I own a copy of the Necronomicon and the Small Key Of Solomon thuluPAIN thuluNOTACULT thuluFEAR
[11/30/18, 8:13:57 AM] ** chaoticloony is jealous of @Ossborn
[11/30/18, 8:14:02 AM] <swJ0k3r> @chaoticloony Hehehe, point taken
[11/30/18, 8:14:07 AM] <MagusGalzu> need the greater keys
[11/30/18, 8:14:23 AM] <starpilotsix> My favorite part of the Cthulhu Mythos are the Great Race of Yith. They're basically scientists that mindswap across time with other species to study stuff.
[11/30/18, 8:14:36 AM] <lordyoloswag69> PRE INTERNET THE ANCIENT TIMES
[11/30/18, 8:14:56 AM] <MagusGalzu> do you know how to use the all seeing eye?
[11/30/18, 8:14:56 AM] <zer0cypher> If you can't separate the work from the creator these days, you'd never get to enjoy anything
[11/30/18, 8:15:06 AM] <cookierawwr331> Nyarlathotep was the greatest
[11/30/18, 8:15:09 AM] <Bosko01> John Dee was linked to the creation of the OTO from memory, that Crowely was kicked out of whole secret society of majicks blah blah

[11/30/18, 8:16:02 AM] <MagusGalzu> did i say asecret
[11/30/18, 8:16:17 AM] <ChancellorIndecent> I remeber there was a Lovecraft podcast (late 00s/10s)) that went through all the works of Lovecraft, and they even made a comic, but the went behind a paywall.
[11/30/18, 8:16:27 AM] <lordyoloswag69> this dude is incepting my mind right now
[11/30/18, 8:16:39 AM] <FuffyButt> it grows bigger as it goes back in time
[11/30/18, 8:16:45 AM] <chaoticloony> Lovecraft is a fascinating read
[11/30/18, 8:17:11 AM] <zer0cypher> Mythos adjacent is a term I don't hear nearly enough
[11/30/18, 8:17:27 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Mannavaht perhaps it is for the best common persons are unable to have access to such Truths
[11/30/18, 8:17:33 AM] <Ossborn> How do you beat the Hounds of Tindalos? Asking for a friend (and with friend, I mean my 1930s Cthulhu pen & paper character)? :-D
[11/30/18, 8:17:38 AM] <MagusGalzu> if you rewind time the world gets smaller
[11/30/18, 8:17:40 AM] <cookierawwr331> So..how did Lovecraft die, I thought it cancer but some people said suiide?
