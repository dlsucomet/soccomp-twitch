[12/7/18, 8:13:53 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi Ryan and Kate!
[12/7/18, 8:14:02 AM] <fhhuber> Well.. I know not to watch the 2 idiots
[12/7/18, 8:14:24 AM] <chaoticloony> Kate always kills it with her Boots game!
[12/7/18, 8:14:41 AM] <dindin66> they seem genuine and friendly 12/10 would go watch
[12/7/18, 8:15:03 AM] <Evil_Tym> @chaoticloony Yeah, it's honestly not that big of a deal. I just have to make sure I catch the shows live. I'd rather support the Twitch channel rather than the Youtube because of how much more freedom they have with content. Oh well. PJSalt
[12/7/18, 8:15:08 AM] <chaoticloony> @dindin66 If you like CHAOS, then they are worth watching
[12/7/18, 8:16:32 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> What is that background sound?
[12/7/18, 8:16:41 AM] <chaoticloony> I am old enough to be Kates father too, so many kids on this channel!

[12/7/18, 8:18:54 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> that too @Deathstar_Taco :D
[12/7/18, 8:18:56 AM] <chaoticloony> Civilization is the original major 4X game
[12/7/18, 8:19:24 AM] <Baelfrie> Oh god Arrival... as a linguist I have to say that was the most amazing misunderstanding/misuse of the Sapir Whorf Hypothesis heh >.>
[12/7/18, 8:19:27 AM] <roberttables> I was an Age of Empires kid way back
[12/7/18, 8:19:37 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> yeah some of the other Spanish students in my college class were starting to dream in the Spanish
[12/7/18, 8:19:38 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> my favourite 4X games are the X games, the early ones anyway. waiting to hear about the new one, x3 left me cold
[12/7/18, 8:20:04 AM] <SouperDumpling> I enjoy playing Stellaris recently
[12/7/18, 8:20:13 AM] <chaoticloony> I found Civilization and Warlords on a BBS and have been addicted to 4X games since

[12/7/18, 8:20:48 AM] <JeffM0307> Night Oss
[12/7/18, 8:20:57 AM] <ArisBranwin> Is it bad that I always enjoy what he wears?
[12/7/18, 8:21:07 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> !dapper
[12/7/18, 8:21:08 AM] <Nightbot> Ryan Green has a unique style all his own. We can't always explain it, but rest assured, he's always going to look dapper AF.
[12/7/18, 8:21:12 AM] <Ossborn> @chaoticloony LOL, I am not leaving..... this only happens soometimes WHEN I play HOM&M :-D
[12/7/18, 8:21:13 AM] <roberttables> Social anything also introduces a huge amount of risk and toxicity that we didn't have "back in the day" I'll just throw that out there
[12/7/18, 8:21:13 AM] <DiceAndDishes> I understand @ossborn , I understand
[12/7/18, 8:21:22 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> no, no I'd say that was just fine @ArisBranwin
[12/7/18, 8:21:28 AM] <chaoticloony> @Ossborn ok, i know that feeling
[12/7/18, 8:21:42 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> iirc the first 4X I played was one of the Spaceward Ho! games (think wild west but in space on the Smack 'n Trash)
[12/7/18, 8:21:57 AM] <JeffM0307> @Ossborn Whoops, habit. :D
[12/7/18, 8:22:24 AM] <Ossborn> Yeah... you just saw the "time for bed" and muzscle memory did the rest, right? :-D
[12/7/18, 8:22:35 AM] <grif319> It's intresting the idea of how talking to a random person it unique and counted weired
[12/7/18, 8:23:06 AM] <Ossborn> If you find extra letters in my posts, feel free to keep them and use them yourself, whenever needed FailFish
[12/7/18, 8:23:15 AM] <chaoticloony> I actually have Master of Magic and the the original Master of Orion installed on my computer
[12/7/18, 8:23:59 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> which wizard is your fav @chaoticloony ?
[12/7/18, 8:24:32 AM] <MasterSteel> man i had a wow gf too but it never went anywhere
[12/7/18, 8:24:33 AM] <chaoticloony> I usually play a fire wizard on Myrrh
[12/7/18, 8:25:09 AM] <DiceAndDishes> Called it
[12/7/18, 8:25:23 AM] <roberttables> Pond plus timezones, still a real issue
[12/7/18, 8:25:56 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> I met two significant others in Yahoo!Chat 20 years ago... even moved countries for 3 years because of it
[12/7/18, 8:26:46 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> We appreciate your passion, Kate. :D
[12/7/18, 8:26:55 AM] <MasterSteel> the good ole days of pointless aol instant messenger relationships
[12/7/18, 8:27:17 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> cool! my fav was S'sssrah or w/e the red/white one on Myrror (isolationistic Planar Seal til I realized I probably should get to Arcanus before I Seal things for a bit)
[12/7/18, 8:27:29 AM] <chaoticloony> I made some great friends when i played Anarchy Online 14 years ago
[12/7/18, 8:27:38 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> then met three more partners through a humour blog once I moved back... married one of them 13 years ago! (these were sequential, not parallel relationships btw)
[12/7/18, 8:28:04 AM] <chaoticloony> @Deathstar_Taco I usually choose his pic to keep from having to deal with him
[12/7/18, 8:28:14 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> <3
[12/7/18, 8:28:57 AM] <Ossborn> The good old instant messenger days... I changed my original internet nickname because of ICQ... after receiving dozens (!!!) of friendrequests from India. Then I asked... turns out my nick back then meant "boy for adult favours" in India.... Whoops
[12/7/18, 8:29:02 AM] <MasterSteel> good to lose? what kinda weaksauce is that... Kappa
[12/7/18, 8:29:07 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> @chaoticloony Snake Wizards on a Plane?! We don't need no Fire-casting Snake Wizards on our Fire-casting Plane!
[12/7/18, 8:29:18 AM] <chaoticloony> !points @Deathstar_Taco
[12/7/18, 8:29:19 AM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, @Deathstar_Taco! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 17 points!
[12/7/18, 8:29:24 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> ICQ... I had a 6-digit number!
[12/7/18, 8:29:37 AM] <chaoticloony> @Deathstar_Taco + 63 points to that
[12/7/18, 8:29:50 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> I still technically have access to it, but it's not what it used to be
[12/7/18, 8:30:03 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> Failure is always an option!
[12/7/18, 8:30:07 AM] <MasterSteel> @JustHere4Coffee it took me a while to realize ICQ = i seek you
[12/7/18, 8:30:24 AM] <Geksa_> Hey chat? When will the show start?
[12/7/18, 8:30:37 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> I still identify that "uh-oh" noise more with ICQ than Lemmings
