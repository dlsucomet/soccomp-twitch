[12/14/18, 8:05:23 AM] <Kevin_Kelly> I actually love the Just Cause games. Pure fun.
[12/14/18, 8:05:31 AM] <Ossborn> I saw a video today, this game makes a lot of people feel sick, the motion blur effect seems to be responsible for it
[12/14/18, 8:05:34 AM] <chaoticloony> I remember when playing Just Cause and other games like this was a show on the channel
[12/14/18, 8:05:36 AM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I've heard of the game franchise, but never played it.
[12/14/18, 8:05:39 AM] <GlitchonTwitch> Okay, but I relate when stuff like that happens
[12/14/18, 8:05:41 AM] <totallynotagoat3> sorry to go off topic, but hector have you seen into the spider-verse yet?

[12/14/18, 8:06:56 AM] <vexelghost> I heard they improved 4 from 3. Apparently 3's engine wasn't well optimized.
[12/14/18, 8:06:57 AM] <lemoneaterl> I can't tell if Hector is being facetious about the compellingness
