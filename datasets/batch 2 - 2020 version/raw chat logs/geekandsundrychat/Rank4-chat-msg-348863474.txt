[12/14/18, 3:37:10 PM] <VilleinD> monkaS chat monkaS
[12/14/18, 3:37:10 PM] <skulllad> he should roll percentage to see if he shoots a pepper arrow
[12/14/18, 3:37:15 PM] <anjanae> The battle would have been winnable if they had all arrived at the same time and focused on attacking as a team, rather than trying to bail
[12/14/18, 3:37:16 PM] <unbeknownst_thinker> If Jester dies, Travis gets divorced
[12/14/18, 3:37:17 PM] <tstercula> isn't it disadv on melee attack rolls?
[12/14/18, 3:37:21 PM] <Zengoblin> What happened to jester? i missed it
[12/14/18, 3:37:21 PM] <rebuild88> If theyd stop jerking off spread out and get on the thing its not even a hard fight
[12/14/18, 3:37:22 PM] <Roan1430> laura is so sure she is gonna die... its all over her face
[12/14/18, 3:37:25 PM] <november23> And the other cleric bailed abandoning them
[12/14/18, 3:37:25 PM] <hornsolo422> weird that you'd have a disadvantage shooting up at a target from prone
[12/14/18, 3:37:28 PM] <Lucius_Warbaby> Jester is the weakest character. I won't be sad if she dies. Maybe Laura will roll a more impressive character next.
[12/14/18, 3:37:28 PM] <BlackPeanutz> should be force

[12/14/18, 3:37:42 PM] <battlesack> awkward the disadvantge is for being within melee not for being prone
[12/14/18, 3:37:46 PM] <WhtsTht> They rolled earlier to see if he fired the pepper arrow he had, or an explosive arrow. Pepper was used.
[12/14/18, 3:37:47 PM] <SaoirseWitch> time!
[12/14/18, 3:37:51 PM] <wasted_bandwidth> should def be force but whatevs

[12/14/18, 3:37:59 PM] <TheDiMono> @battlesack The dragon is elevated, so he's not within melee
[12/14/18, 3:38:00 PM] <zaktp487> jester is the best omg, i just tuned in, i hope she's okay! :(
[12/14/18, 3:38:02 PM] <scamper333> shes actually the second strongest to Yasha

[12/14/18, 3:38:05 PM] <Mewlan> @Shimmerz i think the orb is teleporting them to a different part of it, since there werent other doorways it seems. plus the fire ele might kill it after they leave

[12/14/18, 3:38:18 PM] <22bebo> If Jester doesn't go before Caleb, he won't know she's still there. She might be left alone against the dragon and the elemental.

[12/14/18, 3:40:07 PM] <Daetrin_Voltari> Yep. There is honestly no reason for Caleb to wait. Running is the only smart thing for the character.

[12/14/18, 3:40:18 PM] <jadaji> Laura's face is killing me inside.
[12/14/18, 3:40:20 PM] <Dastrodas> rip jester ;-;
[12/14/18, 3:40:20 PM] <tstercula> it used its reaction!
[12/14/18, 3:40:22 PM] <Xynnen> jester can just disengage, she appears ten feet from her last place, she can get there in one move action
[12/14/18, 3:40:23 PM] <gruph7891> Dimension door is 4th lvl spell. She should have misty step.
[12/14/18, 3:40:24 PM] <WHAMBAM> HE'S DEAD!
[12/14/18, 3:40:24 PM] <PaganMars> oh no is Nott and Jester's detective agency over? was Twiggy really sent to replace them? LUL
[12/14/18, 3:40:24 PM] <True_Monk3y> jesters dead
[12/14/18, 3:40:25 PM] <barco588> they're gonna leave jester to die, I can feel it. oh god please no
[12/14/18, 3:40:26 PM] <Volttreb> gandsLHMercer gandsLHMercer gandsLHMercer gandsLHMercer
[12/14/18, 3:40:26 PM] <rebuild88> Its a shame they really could have cut him down pretty easy but instead they wasted a bunch of turns on nonsense
[12/14/18, 3:40:28 PM] <VulgarDinosaur> It's blind, but Nott is in melee. Blindsight doesn't let you know what someone is doing, just where they are.
[12/14/18, 3:40:29 PM] <foxfall> Can Jester teleport?
[12/14/18, 3:40:31 PM] <rubelito94> this is bad for jester guys
[12/14/18, 3:40:31 PM] <Terrorizem> I'm so annoyed why did the leave
[12/14/18, 3:40:31 PM] <lordlarkon> This is actually pretty heartbreaking
[12/14/18, 3:40:31 PM] <xdarthjones> jester is going to die
[12/14/18, 3:40:33 PM] <KrazilyGeeky> Jester, please live

[12/14/18, 3:40:55 PM] <elliethedream> JESTER!! ;A;!!
[12/14/18, 3:40:55 PM] <UsedBodypillow> @BadSkeelz no range for that
[12/14/18, 3:40:57 PM] <texas097> jester used polymorph, she can't dimension door
[12/14/18, 3:40:59 PM] <Ayanz0> she burned her 4th on poly
[12/14/18, 3:41:00 PM] <SiderBlue> Can she paint something?
[12/14/18, 3:41:00 PM] <unclechoo1> :(
[12/14/18, 3:41:02 PM] <SwimCapp> D:
[12/14/18, 3:41:02 PM] <TurtleGooshGoosh> Fire Elemental already used his reaction. 4th level spell was already used.
[12/14/18, 3:41:04 PM] <Clonechow> MERCER
[12/14/18, 3:41:04 PM] <wtflock1> @Lucius_Warbaby you weren't opining you were being a dick about Laura's choices and saying she should roll someone worthwhile. worthwhile is relative, and Jester is clearly worthwhile
[12/14/18, 3:41:04 PM] <Metoma> NotLikeThis
[12/14/18, 3:41:05 PM] <th3mi5t> I feel like Laura doesnt know she can action disengage
[12/14/18, 3:41:05 PM] <turnc0at> FeelsBadMan

[12/14/18, 3:41:06 PM] <sTxLightning> lmao
[12/14/18, 3:41:07 PM] <lunchablespizza> she has not dimension door, she already used polymorph
[12/14/18, 3:41:07 PM] <MoonlitDNC> gandsSpoopy gandsSpoopy gandsSpoopy gandsSpoopy

[12/14/18, 3:41:09 PM] <bluegoat11> She has no 4th level slots left for dimension door
[12/14/18, 3:41:10 PM] <DeathDaKitti> 21 health

[12/14/18, 3:41:17 PM] <SK8_GEEK> why not pop closer to orb, disengage and run? should be in range of 30
[12/14/18, 3:41:18 PM] <ediccar> \ouch
[12/14/18, 3:41:21 PM] <derekleeketchum> Dimension Door is 4th level, she already used her slot on Polymorph
[12/14/18, 3:41:21 PM] <Cirex145> This is why you don't leave people behind
[12/14/18, 3:41:22 PM] <Deeds1232> Guys the dragon is NOT on deaths door, there were a lot of ppl low health, trying to kill the dragon would be stupid. That is how Molly died
[12/14/18, 3:41:22 PM] <boxxinggandhi> The group really makes bad decisions on these long games
[12/14/18, 3:41:22 PM] <theIrishcommander> Aw man, this is the third battle that they've just run from. Matt really has scared them so bad of dying with molly. Still love the show though
[12/14/18, 3:41:23 PM] <suchplaymuchpro> healing mid-fight is actually a pretty sub-par idea. almost anything is better :(

[12/14/18, 3:42:13 PM] <Roan1430> why the fuck did cad leave
[12/14/18, 3:42:15 PM] <Lucius_Warbaby> @wtflock1 if it's relative its an opinion! Sorry my opinion is not like yours. We are different. Are you ok with difference? @Jakai_1 Sure my opinions are often unique. Thank you for the compliment!
[12/14/18, 3:42:17 PM] <raswartz73> Jester is going to get hit and no one there to heal her...
[12/14/18, 3:42:18 PM] <LeafSizzle> oh no

[12/14/18, 3:43:54 PM] <wtflock1> @Lucius_Warbaby dude, one of the rules of this channel is not being a dick. 2) Laura is CLEARLY extremely upset. why would you attack her at this moment other than to be a complete asshole? it's not about difference, i'm fine with people being different. you're just trying to provoke and this channel has a rule against that.
[12/14/18, 3:43:57 PM] <CACS88> I can't lose Jester!!!!

[12/14/18, 3:44:32 PM] <KrazilyGeeky> If they all escape, I want them to go back and kill the dragon. He's done too much damage
[12/14/18, 3:44:34 PM] <foxfall> They've killed two full pirate crews. They've got this!

[12/14/18, 3:44:39 PM] <Paladonis> I do hope they come back tothis thing at a later level and spank this dragon.
[12/14/18, 3:44:42 PM] <xaevyn> people understand that the cast cant see this right?
[12/14/18, 3:44:43 PM] <tuggnasty> i wouldn't blame Jester leaving the group

[12/14/18, 3:44:50 PM] <ExcessiveWarlock> on the one hand Laura is dealing with this way better than she does when its someone else maybe dying, on the other hand Laura looks so sad trying to act like she's okay
[12/14/18, 3:44:56 PM] <tharacus> Is Twigs going to sacrifice herself to save them?
[12/14/18, 3:44:58 PM] <Lucius_Warbaby> @freecactustony lol. When opinions are different you resort to name calling? Nice. You guys are really accepting of different opinions. @wtflock1 I'm just thinking about the story. Narratively it makes sense for a charachter to die. Dragons are no joke.
[12/14/18, 3:44:59 PM] <thehorizon997> @Jokcrusto Liam said that
[12/14/18, 3:44:59 PM] <gruph7891> Laura still has to survive a 1d10 damage roll from being on fire.... We are not out yet!!
