[01/10/19, 1:31:49 PM] <KBTibbs> I dunno. TBD rebranding confuses me. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø oh well.
[01/10/19, 1:31:53 PM] <geminilightning> can we start the new year with dressage please
[01/10/19, 1:32:02 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @OrionLightning the ending of the TBD holiday special abotu how things change makes a whole lot more sense now though
[01/10/19, 1:32:12 PM] <MonocleSociety> *sigh*
[01/10/19, 1:32:13 PM] <JeffM0307> We'll be Weaving in and out of the game occasionally
[01/10/19, 1:32:15 PM] <MonocleSociety> Good times.
[01/10/19, 1:32:16 PM] <Nemisar> You and your brain will be not so confused after a month or two :P
[01/10/19, 1:32:25 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @MonocleSociety
[01/10/19, 1:32:31 PM] <Nemisar> Brain re-allignment TBD
[01/10/19, 1:32:34 PM] <geminilightning> as long as we get a few games with the Sally Ride...
[01/10/19, 1:32:38 PM] <MonocleSociety> hay @chaoticloony !
[01/10/19, 1:32:47 PM] <geminilightning> I can dream
[01/10/19, 1:33:01 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @KBTibbs Eric said the idea of TBD was to chane games all the time weve does that as part of how it works so using that as a base and thehn throwing in other systems as short runs and one shots makes sense
[01/10/19, 1:33:05 PM] <Nemisar> Dreams are made of nothing, but can turn into something!

[01/10/19, 1:37:22 PM] <BaneHarlock> I just want Amy to sing more, after seeing her on stream of many eyes. I want a Hellclaw and snakefire album with her and Jason Charles Miller.
[01/10/19, 1:37:52 PM] <KBTibbs> @BaneHarlock There are a couple singing videos on Amy's youtube channel from her vlog days
[01/10/19, 1:37:54 PM] <chaoticloony> @BaneHarlock a lot of us would love that!
[01/10/19, 1:38:01 PM] <LordGreatwolf> whats the tbd meaning?
[01/10/19, 1:38:03 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> @BaneHarlock One of the many reason to watch her Twitch Channel
[01/10/19, 1:38:14 PM] <DanManMtn> To Be Determined
[01/10/19, 1:38:16 PM] <chaoticloony> @LordGreatwolf To Be Determined

[01/10/19, 1:38:46 PM] <KBTibbs> @BaneHarlock Sadly, Amy's music video has been removed from Geek and Sundry's Youtube channel. It was real good.
[01/10/19, 1:38:58 PM] <LordGreatwolf> so obvious im shamed now

[01/10/19, 1:39:15 PM] <Zismarith> @LordGreatwolf TBD began when Eric Campbell began a Doctor Who game whose name was literally to be determined. The crew and the viewers really liked it and just ran with it!
[01/10/19, 1:39:19 PM] <Blizardstar1200> I love watching all these wonderful people play because its such utter nonsense and for me over on east coast it happens all after midnight so i always watch it very tired and thats honestly the best way to watch this imo lol
[01/10/19, 1:39:21 PM] <DanManMtn> Hey @sprinklesthedragoncat
[01/10/19, 1:39:28 PM] <DarkestArgentum> this is SUCH a cool setting
