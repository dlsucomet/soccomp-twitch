[01/12/19, 7:54:33 AM] <Ronin_LXXIII> I'm kind of curious about this actually
[01/12/19, 7:54:38 AM] <abstractism> it looks like a great time
[01/12/19, 7:54:43 AM] <Ronin_LXXIII> !whenisvtm

[01/12/19, 7:54:59 AM] <abstractism> I haven't seen LABN yet and its next on my VOD backlog
[01/12/19, 7:55:12 AM] <Riliaf> !rbschedule
[01/12/19, 7:55:13 AM] <abstractism> should I hold off til I'm done with season 1 first?
[01/12/19, 7:55:29 AM] <furrysunite12> Oh. theres 4 hours before it begins?XD I thought it was starting in an hour. guess I have plenty of time XD
[01/12/19, 7:55:42 AM] <irisironic> !rbschedule
[01/12/19, 7:56:00 AM] <The12Hexes> !schedule
[01/12/19, 7:56:01 AM] <bigbluesquare> I always saw LABN as a how that you needed to be caught up on to understand
[01/12/19, 7:56:07 AM] <Mendigoalado> OMFG there iss this huge time difference between brazil and there
[01/12/19, 7:56:08 AM] <Nemisar> If this is anything like last time, it will be quite a different kind of RPG show than people are used to, but still fun
[01/12/19, 7:56:09 AM] <ComicBookJoker> abstractism I'm not sure. Tonight is the first episode of Season 2.
[01/12/19, 7:56:17 AM] <furrysunite12> and abstracritsm I personally would suggest stariting to watch it now. epsiode 1 and 2 are good places to start , by the end of episode 2 you will either want to watch it first or it will be time for season 2 to start. either way win win
[01/12/19, 7:56:29 AM] <ArisBranwin> I'm really hoping Mark is in this... I think thats his name.. the guy for GnS who knows a lot of wrestling stuff
