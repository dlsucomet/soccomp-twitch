[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <CanHazBurritos> Is there no way Europe can't ship more chocolate too us. I keep hearing how it's so much better than the local US stuff we are forced to accept.
[01/17/19, 1:26:54 PM] <gunheadx> sticker shock ???
[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <gunheadx> moin @KBTibbs

[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <caslans> This whole situation sounds fishy
[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <Time2Tabletop> WEAVE HYPE !!!
[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <swiftfingers> @CanHazBurritos well, switzerland isn't part of the EU so....
[01/17/19, 1:27:16 PM] <swiftfingers> that's a new expression for me as well
[01/17/19, 1:27:23 PM] <CanHazBurritos> price shock @gunheadx

[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Hello ðŸ‘‹
[01/17/19, 1:27:56 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @swiftfingers it means suprise at the cost of things it comes from price tags in the US atleast often being stickers
[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <Marb_04> animated so she is drawn or cg
[01/21/19, 5:03:30 AM] <VermillionCrimson> I didn't watch this last week so I have no clue what's going on but fuck it. I just wanna chill and watch some RPG stuff with these fine ladies.
[01/17/19, 1:28:00 PM] <swiftfingers> oh yeah, the prices are absolutely crazy
[01/17/19, 1:28:00 PM] <Superalphasquadclan> Yeet

[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <JeffM0307> JOEY LEMONS!
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <KBTibbs> Old Joe Lemon is... kinda gross.
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <anniedisaster09> @VermillionCrimson ask away. You may say I am a Prospect CIty expert ^_^
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <CanHazBurritos> I just meant the continent in general has much better sweets. I have no clue to the quality of Swiss Chocolate.
[01/17/19, 1:28:47 PM] <swiftfingers> people think that because the main income is higher that everyone lives a golden life here, but the price of life is extremely high as well
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <gunheadx> let the madness start :D
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <VermillionCrimson> TL;DW @anniedisaster09 ?
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> If you say so @anniedisaster09 Kappa
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <CanHazBurritos> Well that pencil mustache might be considered a fatal flaw. ;)
[01/17/19, 1:29:40 PM] <anniedisaster09> California (sorry late to the party)
[01/17/19, 1:29:40 PM] <swiftfingers> you're better off going to polynesia than switzerland for a honeymoon
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <swiftfingers> our hosts are some of the loveliest persons
[01/21/19, 5:03:31 AM] <anniedisaster09> Well, they are in a paranoirmal style RPG, where they have managed to jump through a time portal from the Vegas town to its original iteration - an old timey Western town
