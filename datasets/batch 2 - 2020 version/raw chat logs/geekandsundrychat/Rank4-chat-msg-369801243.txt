[01/26/19, 8:07:43 AM] <ArisBranwin> That or the camera affects got more HD.
[01/26/19, 8:07:45 AM] <Suedyin> very very heavy RP and lore, although the combat implementation could be improved

[01/26/19, 8:08:05 AM] <chaoticloony> Torment Tides of Numenera is so fabulous and IS a spiritual successor to the best computer RPG game of all time, Planescape Torment
[01/26/19, 8:08:09 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @sunlitlake You sonunva...NOW IT'S IN MY HEAD!!!!! SwiftRage
[01/26/19, 8:08:21 AM] <JeffM0307> Hello, Darcy...and Holly
[01/26/19, 8:08:22 AM] <Shadowsoflife> @Purplebreeze80 Yes
[01/26/19, 8:08:24 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @Purplebreeze80 LOL
[01/26/19, 8:08:29 AM] <Suedyin> but even with its faults, Torment: Tides of Numenera is one of my all time favourites, right up there with Baldur's Gate 2 and Pillars of Eternity
[01/26/19, 8:08:35 AM] <VermillionCrimson> Eh, I'd argue that Planescape is the best book you'll ever play but the combat is weaksauce.
[01/26/19, 8:08:39 AM] <misroi> @chaoticloony So true! Best damn CRPG back in the dark ages.
