[01/31/19, 8:09:48 AM] <super390> the goal is to stamp out the very existence of people who don't agree with you by making their lives miserable.

[01/31/19, 8:14:25 AM] <super390> when I was going to school on US military bases in Asia, we'd have to get the talk from the bomb disposal guys every year about not picking up strange old objects.

[01/31/19, 8:17:35 AM] <nerdstroms> not sweet unless you add sugar
[01/31/19, 8:17:44 AM] <super390> @Leigh574 I went to 6th Grade at a school at the very foot of Lily Hill in the Philippines, a giant jungle-covered rock; in 1944 the US made a deal with the local pygmy headhunters to go up that thing and kill all the Japanese holed up there. So we were always warned not to go over that fence.
[01/31/19, 8:18:25 AM] <vexelghost> The post RE2 pickle incident?
[01/31/19, 8:18:47 AM] <Leigh574> oh wow @super390 oh yes I'm sure there are items all over around there.
[01/31/19, 8:20:34 AM] <super390> @Leigh574 In exchange for their service, the headhunters got eternal privileges to go on base and buy stuff at the local base exchange (P.I. had a huge black market in cigarettes, etc.). Eternal, until volcanic ash wiped out Clark Air Base.
