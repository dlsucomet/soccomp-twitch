[02/2/19, 12:05:53 PM] <higgensbiggens> Victor's suit is going to have so many red stains tonight
[02/2/19, 12:05:59 PM] <alexwhitechats> @Dragonchrome after the last episode of S1 is uploaded, will it continue with S2 or will it wait until the season ends?
[02/2/19, 12:06:01 PM] <cattoo> @axelobo same thoughts. That suit is going to be wrecked.

[02/2/19, 12:06:08 PM] <KingdomOfRogue> @stunningepiphanies That's what I thought
[02/2/19, 12:06:09 PM] <Duckwark> I thought Victor doesnt wear white because blood stains dont hide as well
[02/2/19, 12:06:13 PM] <webbyghost> Alex is going to kill me i'm suffering
[02/2/19, 12:06:14 PM] <WinterFaery84> Chaz is Nelli's sire, not Mark.
[02/2/19, 12:06:14 PM] <superratlord> @Ronorin sorry S2 is Alpha
[02/2/19, 12:06:14 PM] <VisionarySims> hopefully jasper is a little less flaky
[02/2/19, 12:06:14 PM] <higgensbiggens> Victor is like a nicer suge knight
[02/2/19, 12:06:17 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @jr_bob_loblaw that as a black man he's 100% right to ignore fasion rules ritch white people made up to be mean to each other
[02/2/19, 12:06:20 PM] <PhilosophyPlatypus> If Victor says "When I was a boy...."
[02/2/19, 12:06:22 PM] <zea_the_sorceress> Vampires shouldn't wear white. . .
[02/2/19, 12:06:22 PM] <Flight_Devil> Oh right, they 86'ed the Sheriff last episode
[02/2/19, 12:06:23 PM] <Nemisar> Yes episode 1-3 of season 2, are available here or on projectalpha.com for subscribers :)

[02/2/19, 12:06:41 PM] <mistressdracona> What happened to victor talking about wearing black all the time?
[02/2/19, 12:06:42 PM] <o_coghlan> The toreador in me is freaking out at all these people saying that is a white suit
