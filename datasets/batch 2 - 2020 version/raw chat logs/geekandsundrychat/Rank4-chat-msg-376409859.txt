[02/7/19, 11:06:45 AM] <KaiOrAya> What's a Captain Marvel is a complicated question

[02/7/19, 11:08:05 AM] <chaoticloony> Monica Rambeau is my favorite Captain Marvel!
[02/7/19, 11:08:15 AM] <kuzumi06> back then the real super heroes were those that fought in the World Wars! no Kappa
[02/7/19, 11:08:17 AM] <KBTibbs> Heroes? Sounds like a fad. Everyone lives those romance comics
[02/7/19, 11:08:24 AM] <Critternation3000> @chaoticloony I liked her too
[02/7/19, 11:08:24 AM] <super390> MAD Comics turned this court case into a parody punchout between Superduperman and Capt. Marbles.

[02/7/19, 11:08:49 AM] <tatzelthess> QUESTION: Can I get a crash course of suggested reading for someone completely new to Captain Marvel to binge read before the movie?
[02/7/19, 11:08:50 AM] <sunlitlake> TOPIC: A Franchise of your choice is missing a Captain Marvel. What does THEIR Captain Marvel do to make them different from all the rest? What awkward trait do they all share?
[02/7/19, 11:09:00 AM] <misssunflower94> so many marvels so many captains
[02/7/19, 11:09:02 AM] <super390> Destroy characters, then buy them cheap. Rockefeller couldn't have done it better.

[02/7/19, 11:10:15 AM] <KaiOrAya> @sunlitlake My GF is a 19th c scholar whose dissertation involves aaaall the different bits of sheet music written based off of an opera and she's using 19th c copyright rulings to draw the line between versions and oh boy is her advisor confused about how any of those rulings work
[02/7/19, 11:10:20 AM] <misssunflower94> British Invasion Writers Make Things Weird is Taliesin's fav thing, I've realized.

[02/7/19, 11:10:46 AM] <misssunflower94> @sunlitlake you need to invade more often I miss you
[02/7/19, 11:10:56 AM] <KaiOrAya> @sunlitlake Which pretty much sums up to us looking at her advisor, shrugging and going "Dunno. Copyright is weeeeiiird"

[02/7/19, 11:11:07 AM] <Xynthimero> Wow, I just watched all of Erics TBD RPG again, cause of bad brain distraction, and now I hear the Doctors "I would love to trust you" all the time when Amy talks ðŸ™ˆ I definetly watched too much of the fight between her and Tals Character ðŸ˜…

[02/7/19, 11:11:25 AM] <FuffyButt> QUESTION: Who is on first?
[02/7/19, 11:11:38 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> :D
[02/7/19, 11:11:40 AM] <super390> It should have ended in Alan Moore hurling demonic curses at all the lawyers and making their wigs catch on fire.
[02/7/19, 11:11:55 AM] <AromiaFlyce> QUESTION: Taliesin, will you dye your beard to match your hair? ;)
[02/7/19, 11:11:56 AM] <LadyAngeloftheFullMoon> That is a lot of thing O__O
