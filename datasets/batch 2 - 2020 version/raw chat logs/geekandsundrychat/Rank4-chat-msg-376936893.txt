[02/8/19, 10:29:05 AM] <CinderFlame> @splitseconddecision I've played at tables where the DM's grasp of the rules was inconsistent. Which is fine for a normal game, but not for Adventurer's League...

[02/8/19, 10:30:30 AM] <Lord_Machiavellian> very excited for what Deborah has cooked up with this series.
[02/8/19, 10:30:30 AM] <splitseconddecision> @CinderFlame janky props can be fun, though :D

[02/8/19, 10:30:34 AM] <SuddenCrane> No way Thursday is always Critical
[02/8/19, 10:30:45 AM] <BookTea> oh man, the chat is so quick!
[02/8/19, 10:30:48 AM] <Cha0ticBi> excited for some r&r!
[02/8/19, 10:30:48 AM] <Critical_Nerd247> Pretty sure it airs Mondays
[02/8/19, 10:30:49 AM] <totalelipse> @ThePsychonaut deborah ann woll DMs a game about a group of adventurers going on missions for a proffesion in an artifact shop. It's hard to say more without spoilers.
[02/8/19, 10:30:49 AM] <supersmashbrony> There's a variety of vore, so I can't speak for everyone, but what I can talk about is the stuff that's probably safest for newcomers.
[02/8/19, 10:30:54 AM] <Dr_sterben> critical role is off this week
[02/8/19, 10:30:54 AM] <bardicloreblog> It's cool that they're showing this since there's no CR tonight. This will be my second time seeing it. I wanted to watch it again because it's that good
[02/8/19, 10:30:55 AM] <supersmashbrony> The vore I'm into is soft as soft can be. It's consensual, people are swallowed whole, are alive, comfortable, and safe in the belly, and later they're magically out somehow and I'd prefer to not bother with the details of exactly how that happened.
[02/8/19, 10:30:56 AM] <tabletoptales> CR has the night off - so tonights a special
[02/8/19, 10:30:57 AM] <geminisregio> Thanks for streaming Ep 1.
[02/8/19, 10:30:58 AM] <theoneandonlyandy1> Does anyone know the background Matthew Lillard has for his PC
[02/8/19, 10:30:58 AM] <CinderFlame> @splitseconddecision I just don't have the budget to make even janky ones
[02/8/19, 10:31:02 AM] <zeradeath> it's just to help it get the fan base. word of mouth and all that. when is it starting?
[02/8/19, 10:31:03 AM] <supersmashbrony> I like the closeness of it. The idea of trusting someone enough to eat you and know you'd be safe, or of them trusting you enough for it gives me warm fuzzies. Plus the 'being in the belly' part just strikes me as a lot like a big weird hug. And I like hugs too!
[02/8/19, 10:31:03 AM] <wingedwyrm> So, what's Relics and Rarities going to be? Like that Friday the 13th TV series but for D&D?
[02/8/19, 10:31:04 AM] <BarelyaDrummer> I'm here.. AND MY BODY IS READY
[02/8/19, 10:31:04 AM] <BookTea> @grayraven those emotes look so cool!

[02/8/19, 10:31:13 AM] <supersmashbrony> ...The harder vore, with nonconsentual stuff, violence, and death, is not my cup of tea. I think that fetish is basically about power dynamics, but I'll leave it to someone who's actually into hard vore to discuss it, if they want to.
