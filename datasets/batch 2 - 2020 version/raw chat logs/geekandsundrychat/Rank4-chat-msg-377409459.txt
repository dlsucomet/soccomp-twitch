[02/9/19, 8:00:40 AM] <rjr5wv> man Calisto 5 just doesn't have the same ring to it
[02/9/19, 8:00:47 AM] <Sollux_kid8> *fellow cyberpunks.

[02/9/19, 8:01:00 AM] <Widoe> I'm maybe happier about the prospect of a new Bonnie character than I should be. I mean I learned to like Rue eventually.
[02/9/19, 8:01:03 AM] <newMoonlight> oh goodness...
[02/9/19, 8:01:04 AM] <gallifreyanhalfling> oof, hopps is missing from the art rn

[02/9/19, 8:02:19 AM] <djwho> I'll try to stay around but someone who gets up ridiculously early, I can't promise.

[02/9/19, 8:02:54 AM] <Akeluus> ~Offers favorite Chew Toy to sacrifice for Hopps~ ;w; <3
[02/9/19, 8:02:59 AM] <newMoonlight> I'm going to be really sad if Hopps is actually dead, but at the same time I really like when games embrace the fact that there are consequences
[02/9/19, 8:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> I’ve got Beacon going so hopefully everyone stays in range.
[02/9/19, 8:03:04 AM] <darkofnate> @Slippydude Tell that to Mar-vell...
[02/9/19, 8:03:05 AM] <Slippydude> @vampirequeen29 welcome! also heavy episode ahead

[02/9/19, 8:03:14 AM] <eolhcc47> passes @CinderFlame a blanket
[02/9/19, 8:03:15 AM] <Dabs118> I mean the chances of hoops dying is really high because both anyone and cats are out for 1 round

[02/9/19, 8:03:34 AM] <Henchman2121> Hopefully something exciting happens this week. Last episode was so uneventful. :P
[02/9/19, 8:03:36 AM] <seratonia> This late start isn't doing ANYTHING for my anxiety
[02/9/19, 8:03:42 AM] <Clankzilla> I'm glad and not glad that I can catch this one live
[02/9/19, 8:03:43 AM] <lucath> got my kitten with me for cuddles. bring on the angst

[02/9/19, 8:04:32 AM] <Akeluus> Finally here live, to see Hopps' eyes open {:3
[02/9/19, 8:04:39 AM] <philbe63> I took a nap because there's this and then L.A. by Night...
[02/9/19, 8:04:43 AM] <djwho> How is the weather in Japan @shidareAKI ?
[02/9/19, 8:04:50 AM] <flubb2> She can’t die.
[02/9/19, 8:04:50 AM] <Roger_Butler> BlessRNG 4 Hopps
[02/9/19, 8:04:53 AM] <Slippydude> @shidareAKI Is it that Cass and Anton are both at death's door also....
[02/9/19, 8:04:55 AM] <UselessRogue> let's see if I have the new sub badge...
[02/9/19, 8:04:59 AM] <perfectcosima> if they don't have bonnie onscreen even just until they confirm hopps alive i will perish
[02/9/19, 8:04:59 AM] <Drgnfly476> Why isn’t Hopps in the overlay 😭
[02/9/19, 8:05:01 AM] <Dstunna1> I missed everything after the break last episode is hopps dead?
[02/9/19, 8:05:04 AM] <highvoltage988> yeah I don't usually get to catch gandsC6 live, it runs right through dinner time, but I rushed a quick meal so I could see tonight
[02/9/19, 8:05:04 AM] <seratonia> #HopeForHopps

[02/9/19, 8:05:14 AM] <seratonia> @perfectcosima BIG MOOD
[02/9/19, 8:05:15 AM] <ArisBranwin> Ok I'm here.. I'm wanting to find out what happens to Hopps... oh look theres only 5 characters..
[02/9/19, 8:05:19 AM] <ArisBranwin> This could be bad..
[02/9/19, 8:05:20 AM] <Slippydude> @Dstunna1 we're gonna find out tonight
[02/9/19, 8:05:24 AM] <djwho> @Dstunna1 Hopps' true fate is unknown
[02/9/19, 8:05:30 AM] <Llynok> !rebroadcast
[02/9/19, 8:05:34 AM] <Goldstaralpha> oh.. I KNOW I will not be up for LA... probably have to watch both on the Reruns tomorrow or Sun
[02/9/19, 8:05:35 AM] <perfectcosima> I'm not ramaPANIC at all
[02/9/19, 8:05:37 AM] <Dstunna1> why is she possibly dead?
[02/9/19, 8:05:38 AM] <Llynok> !schedule
[02/9/19, 8:05:38 AM] <marimo132> wait is Anton also real low? @Slippydude aaah I knew HOpps and Cass were bad
[02/9/19, 8:05:39 AM] <ArisBranwin> If Hopps dies will this turn into Callisto 5?
[02/9/19, 8:05:41 AM] <flubb2> Oh come on. This wait isn’t fair.
[02/9/19, 8:05:42 AM] <kangstor> gandsC6 gandsXP
[02/9/19, 8:05:43 AM] <Slippydude> Also, Anton and Cass are almost dead too....
[02/9/19, 8:05:44 AM] <UselessRogue> hey @danoba you guys got the 4 year sub badge ready?
[02/9/19, 8:05:48 AM] <darkofnate> I was kinda wondering if Bonnie was taking to weekend off to go LARPing with Xander...

[02/9/19, 8:05:49 AM] <dragonkingnoir> Hello
[02/9/19, 8:05:51 AM] <misroi> #SaveHopps
[02/9/19, 8:05:54 AM] <philbe63> Can I post my picture of LEGO Hopps and Cobalt?
[02/9/19, 8:05:54 AM] <lukeatwork> even if she does not die, I bet her character will be changed from the experience.. power change etc...
[02/9/19, 8:05:54 AM] <shidareAKI> @dstunna1 right now it’s a flatline situation but we don’t know if it’ll stick.
[02/9/19, 8:05:55 AM] <vampirequeen29> I’m hoping that hoops situation is unknown and that way her art not there
[02/9/19, 8:06:00 AM] <Slippydude> @marimo132 If i remember correctly yes....
[02/9/19, 8:06:04 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @dragonkingnoir
[02/9/19, 8:06:15 AM] <Clankzilla> Bravo to who ever dropped Hopps from this pic, but wtf with the feelings man
[02/9/19, 8:06:17 AM] <Danoba> @UselessRogue Good question.
[02/9/19, 8:06:22 AM] <forestfieldforestfield> "Hey ma, I died yesterday." "That's nice dear, got to go, raid tonight."
[02/9/19, 8:06:29 AM] <seratonia> My anxiety is building
[02/9/19, 8:06:33 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @lukeatwork I think it would be neat to see her shed her skin and basically become a sentient lightning creature thing.
[02/9/19, 8:06:33 AM] <UselessRogue> I just popped my 48 month resub
[02/9/19, 8:06:37 AM] <dragonkingnoir> Hows everyone
[02/9/19, 8:06:38 AM] <vampirequeen29> @lukeatwork I can see that
[02/9/19, 8:06:39 AM] <Widoe> @forestfieldforestfield gandsFacepalm
[02/9/19, 8:06:40 AM] <seratonia> @forestfieldforestfield I hate that this made me laugh
[02/9/19, 8:06:46 AM] <CinderFlame> Seriously though, this title card is epic attention to detail
[02/9/19, 8:06:47 AM] <Akeluus> gandsC6 gandsXP 💚 4 Hopps 💚 gandsXP gandsC6
[02/9/19, 8:06:49 AM] <cleroz> hello, can someone tell me when is the rebroadcast of the CR latest episode?
[02/9/19, 8:06:50 AM] <Slippydude> Also.... Anton and Cass are coughing for their last turn so.... unless they get a new initiative roll.... they in trouble
[02/9/19, 8:06:54 AM] <SakuraDreamerz> oh no
[02/9/19, 8:06:56 AM] <Liselle129> I wonder if they will do it like Critical Role and have the dying character not there until we find out if she's revived
[02/9/19, 8:06:57 AM] <lukeatwork> was thinking the same vermillion
[02/9/19, 8:07:04 AM] <Drgnfly476> This wait do they hate us?
[02/9/19, 8:07:05 AM] <shidareAKI> @cleroz there was no CR this week
[02/9/19, 8:07:07 AM] <djwho> Been looking forward to this all week but I may have to catch the VOD as I am not sure if I will make it all the way through
[02/9/19, 8:07:12 AM] <HeartOfHandprints> Not sure I’m ready for this tonight...
[02/9/19, 8:07:15 AM] <Widoe> love this community so gands much!
[02/9/19, 8:07:17 AM] <ArisBranwin> Theres no new initiative I think..

[02/9/19, 8:07:32 AM] <cenefiel> too much waiting
[02/9/19, 8:07:34 AM] <Danoba> Going up now, should see it shortly.
[02/9/19, 8:07:36 AM] <wanderingace> One life defintely on a knife's edge....others waiting for the ship to drop....most of the Six is in definite danger.
[02/9/19, 8:07:39 AM] ** shidareAKI We know that we’re getting a late start tonight. We thank everyone for their patience.
[02/9/19, 8:07:41 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Anyone cooking any particularly sumptuous nom noms?
[02/9/19, 8:07:43 AM] <FuffyButt> why doesn't the cover screen have Hopps in it?
[02/9/19, 8:07:44 AM] <ArisBranwin> So I'm all paranoid and hoping people don't die.. but if they do.. will the show go on?
[02/9/19, 8:07:47 AM] <Goldstaralpha> I feel ya @djwho
[02/9/19, 8:07:48 AM] <perfectcosima> who let me eat chocolate while wearing a white shirt
[02/9/19, 8:07:51 AM] <Drgnfly476> The waiting is the hardest part
[02/9/19, 8:07:52 AM] <Slippydude> @ArisBranwin If there isn't Cass and Anton just lost their last turn and they cant protect thebot or escape
[02/9/19, 8:07:54 AM] <flubb2> I am so not tired. But should be sleeping. It past midnight in UK
[02/9/19, 8:07:57 AM] <MsLindseyMarie> PROTECC MED BOT
[02/9/19, 8:08:02 AM] <bigxviili> how dare you start late... jk
[02/9/19, 8:08:04 AM] <darkofnate> Despite all the heartbreak, I think it's kinda cool that they've been on the same initiative for 3 weeks now.
[02/9/19, 8:08:04 AM] <tienicus> Oh crap I forgot about what happened last week until just now
[02/9/19, 8:08:08 AM] <dragonkingnoir> I bolted out of my STA game for this
[02/9/19, 8:08:08 AM] <lukeatwork> hopps kinda got power trapped into the situation.. she kept taking that intellect damage from not sleeping and then developed a new power that took chunks out of her intellect
[02/9/19, 8:08:10 AM] <ArisBranwin> I have Mardi Gras donuts that were made..
[02/9/19, 8:08:10 AM] <Slippydude> @perfectcosima was it white chocolate?
[02/9/19, 8:08:12 AM] <Alarah> @ArisBranwin I'm sure the show would go on
