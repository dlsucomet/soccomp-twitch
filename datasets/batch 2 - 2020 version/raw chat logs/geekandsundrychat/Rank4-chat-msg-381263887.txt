[02/16/19, 7:58:57 AM] <ZachsMind> howdy from Dallas!
[02/16/19, 7:58:59 AM] <misroi> So...issue #2.5?
[02/16/19, 7:59:01 AM] <seratonia> Hello hello everyone!
[02/16/19, 7:59:05 AM] <ExcessiveWarlock> @zachsmind I mean, they have to have more than one outfit. You're fine.
[02/16/19, 7:59:11 AM] <KBTibbs> Hey Folks
[02/16/19, 7:59:14 AM] <ZachsMind> "COFFEE?"
[02/16/19, 7:59:16 AM] <highvoltage988> yeah I'm never prepared for Sal, he's a cuddly loveable heartbreaker
[02/16/19, 7:59:19 AM] <geminilightning> Dads time?
[02/16/19, 7:59:25 AM] <seratonia> It's so nice to see Hopps back on the card
[02/16/19, 7:59:31 AM] <lillydrag0n> Glad to see all six here. Last week I almost panicked when hopps was missing.

[02/16/19, 7:59:39 AM] <FallzVentus> Hello. First Time catching Callisto 6 live
[02/16/19, 7:59:39 AM] <KaiOrAya> By the way. Have folks seen Kaitlin's animation from last ep?
[02/16/19, 7:59:43 AM] <abstractism> laundry day
[02/16/19, 7:59:52 AM] <VermillionCrimson> @kaioraya Eh?
[02/16/19, 7:59:57 AM] <ZachsMind> I put them in a brown leather jacket and green shirt. In hindsight that was a bad idea.
[02/16/19, 8:00:02 AM] <misroi> Yeah, that was bad times with no Hopps art.
[02/16/19, 8:00:03 AM] <ExcessiveWarlock> So glad to see Hopps back
[02/16/19, 8:00:07 AM] <JustHere4Coffee> @lillydrag0n me too, but they handled that really well I thught

[02/16/19, 8:00:35 AM] <Sollux_kid8> Hello, all!
[02/16/19, 8:00:52 AM] <misroi> Lacy's motto is clearly "suns out guns out," and every day is sunny.
[02/16/19, 8:01:03 AM] <ZachsMind> "mosty just my legs and my butt and.. and my legs and my butt."
[02/16/19, 8:01:04 AM] <sgpch> finaly im in time..

[02/16/19, 8:02:14 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @shidareAKI and all the other Supepunks
[02/16/19, 8:02:19 AM] <abstractism> does my brain ever remember useful things and info about life? naw, its ghostbusters and robocop and the most pointless stuff in life that gets memorized
[02/16/19, 8:02:35 AM] <sammifed16> Hi @chaoticloony
[02/16/19, 8:02:35 AM] <abstractism> lol
[02/16/19, 8:02:36 AM] <gogt200> It is so nice to finally catch this live again. It has been so long!
[02/16/19, 8:02:49 AM] <lukeatwork> lol my brain is filled with 80's movies trivia
[02/16/19, 8:02:58 AM] <Slippydude> HellO!
[02/16/19, 8:03:03 AM] <misroi> So, what the team needs after this is some downtime to recoup from almost losing Hopps. What I expect they'll get is an emotional rollercoaster.
[02/16/19, 8:03:04 AM] <ornixen> love catching it live with my wife :)

[02/16/19, 8:04:20 AM] <ExcessiveWarlock> I think this is the first one I have caught live for the whole thing. I started somewhere in the middle of a bunch of Issue 1 eps, and eventually went back and watched them all during the break. Kept missing the new issues b\c of work, so this is exciting.
