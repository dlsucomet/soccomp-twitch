[02/21/19, 11:09:40 AM] <super390> okay, if this is really an Orson Welles vs Marlon Brando fight, do they get to use their gravitational fields?

[02/21/19, 11:10:11 AM] <spiritualsirene> Rec.arts is older than i am, I think
[02/21/19, 11:10:21 AM] <ceruleanfleur> This is why I like Squirrel Girl...they kept the letters in the graphic novel forms
