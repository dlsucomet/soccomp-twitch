[02/21/19, 1:29:05 PM] <postdataest> !clock .| TBD RPG 9.30-11pm, Hosts jump into one of the many fantastical worlds of the Weave RPG
[02/21/19, 1:29:05 PM] <Nightbot> It is currently Wednesday 9:29 PM at the Geek & Sundry studio in California.
[02/21/19, 1:29:12 PM] <swiftfingers> and it's the second day in a row where I get a gut punch, it's been a bad week

[02/21/19, 1:29:22 PM] <ArisBranwin> Unbeweaveable..
[02/21/19, 1:29:25 PM] <KBTibbs> @swiftfingers I'm not sure what that's supposed to explain? I mean, I understand you didn't know.
[02/21/19, 1:29:29 PM] <swiftfingers> right when I wake up too
[02/21/19, 1:29:31 PM] <japenrose> !points @ArisBranwin
[02/21/19, 1:29:31 PM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, @ArisBranwin! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 37 points!
[02/21/19, 1:29:36 PM] <ArisBranwin> I think this is either c6 or game engine bumper.. YAY
[02/21/19, 1:29:39 PM] <MeggieMay328> I've been having a bad six months and this isn't helping
[02/21/19, 1:29:44 PM] <chaoticloony> Remember that it took the end of other shows that people loved to get The Wednesday Club on, who knows what may be coming next.
[02/21/19, 1:29:52 PM] <CrashTestGremlin> An amazing surprise that won't happen would be them getting a new show called "But that's a whole different episode" for all the episodes they never got to do
[02/21/19, 1:29:53 PM] <Zismarith> gandsFacepalm gandsHappy gandsHype gandsClassic stefHighFive

[02/21/19, 1:30:25 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> kinda like that idea @CrashTestGremlin
[02/21/19, 1:30:27 PM] <KBTibbs> @chaoticloony Wow. I don't think that's 1) a good tack to take 2) I don't think the cancelling of shows was required at all.
[02/21/19, 1:30:29 PM] <Femilie> I mean what happens, not the name haha

[02/21/19, 1:33:44 PM] <Zismarith> @CinderFlame Even from the beginning back in 2015, shows came and left. Maybe they ran outta topics, I dunno. But we've lost the comics show before and here we are again.
[02/21/19, 1:33:45 PM] <Impossiblegirl11> Hello @xrikerred1
[02/21/19, 1:33:48 PM] <PAPerryman> If we needed to know, we'd know
[02/21/19, 1:33:54 PM] <TheDiMono> @salvageBar It's now running on the CR Twitch and being hosted here, rather than running here and being hosted there
[02/21/19, 1:33:59 PM] <KBTibbs> @TheDiMono Nightbot is a slave to mod politics.
[02/21/19, 1:34:01 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> Go BECCA ! It's your birthday!
[02/21/19, 1:34:13 PM] <MeggieMay328> Ok Critical l Role has left G&S That's been going to happen for a while and it's not going away

[02/21/19, 1:41:57 PM] <chaoticloony> This and Asinine Wisdom fill up my CHAOS meter so fabulously.
[02/21/19, 1:42:11 PM] <swiftfingers> lol
[02/21/19, 1:42:11 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> :) a good combo
[02/21/19, 1:42:19 PM] <ArisBranwin> You need to watch c6 for Sam. as Sam is the embodiment of Chaos.

[02/21/19, 1:42:58 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> incedentally we can actually rely on both to be chaotic, can't we? @chaoticloony
[02/21/19, 1:43:05 PM] <swiftfingers> This week has filled my chaos meter to the brink
[02/21/19, 1:43:11 PM] <SprinklesTheDragonCat> A lot of people don't like The Greenery. I am saying people don't like to eat vegetables. FACTS

[02/21/19, 1:44:35 PM] <chaoticloony> @ArisBranwin Sam's CHAOS is so fabulous, but the rest need to up their CHAOS factor on the show.
[02/21/19, 1:44:36 PM] <derekleeketchum> @paperryman obviously it's a more common misconception than we gave it credit for Kappa
[02/21/19, 1:44:36 PM] <ArisBranwin> Please Weave responsibly..
