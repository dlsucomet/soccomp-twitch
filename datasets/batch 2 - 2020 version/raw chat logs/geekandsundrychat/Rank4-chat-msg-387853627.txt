[02/28/19, 11:06:24 AM] <Tappinman> She was on Trueblood
[02/28/19, 11:06:26 AM] <Actofmercy> yeah she was on Trueblood
[02/28/19, 11:06:28 AM] <ImWastingLifeOnTwitch> what is this show guys?

[02/28/19, 11:06:47 AM] <ZachsMind> The production quality of this show is amazing.
[02/28/19, 11:06:48 AM] <gabstersdictionary> I wish I could play like this
[02/28/19, 11:06:59 AM] <PillowCatt> I also loved her in Daredevil. I'm so sad it's cancelled NotLikeThis

[02/28/19, 11:07:22 AM] <TheDiMono> @MrCertainly The reasons for ending the show have not been released.
[02/28/19, 11:07:24 AM] <Henchman2121> @pillowcatt Agreed. The last season was amazing.
[02/28/19, 11:07:25 AM] <Tappinman> Is this show live or edited?
[02/28/19, 11:07:26 AM] <buddybluejay> So is this all scripted, or is it on the spot? O:
[02/28/19, 11:07:28 AM] <TheDiMono> @GenoHD Yes, this is prerecorded
[02/28/19, 11:07:34 AM] <gabstersdictionary> This intro is amazing
[02/28/19, 11:07:42 AM] <Aoth> pre recorded content SeemsGood
[02/28/19, 11:07:43 AM] <ecko3o6> is this LARP
[02/28/19, 11:07:45 AM] <SilvanCosplay> @buddybluejay on the spot.
[02/28/19, 11:07:45 AM] <TheDiMono> @buddybluejay Deborah has a rough plot she anticipates the players following, but everything is improv on the spot
[02/28/19, 11:07:45 AM] <afishkiller> Request: Love seeing the casts' reactions to seeing the set. Can you include those in the future?
[02/28/19, 11:07:46 AM] <ravenwatcher3> Ooo this opening is so cool!
[02/28/19, 11:07:52 AM] <PillowCatt> The intro IS amazing! @gabstersdictionary
[02/28/19, 11:07:52 AM] <soli_solo> this is pretty cool
[02/28/19, 11:07:53 AM] <NebulousDream> first time watching and this is amazing already

[02/28/19, 11:08:04 AM] <MrCertainly> Wait, this is pre-recorded? So we're watching a live broadcast of a recorded show....
[02/28/19, 11:08:05 AM] <VidDuality> Oooooh nice set design! bryandOMG
[02/28/19, 11:08:06 AM] <gabstersdictionary> bryandHeart
[02/28/19, 11:08:07 AM] <cinphoria> It's prerecorded, but not scripted. This is an actual play show
[02/28/19, 11:08:08 AM] <swiftfingers> hey woke up just in time
[02/28/19, 11:08:09 AM] <buddybluejay> @SilvanCosplay @TheDiMono Okay! That's so cool!
[02/28/19, 11:08:12 AM] <Henchman2121> @buddybluejay DM has ideas, but everything is basically improved on top of that.
[02/28/19, 11:08:16 AM] <TheDiMono> @MrCertainly Yep
[02/28/19, 11:08:17 AM] <ecko3o6> i rolled a critical failure am i still alive
[02/28/19, 11:08:18 AM] <JeffM0307> !frontpage
[02/28/19, 11:08:18 AM] <Nightbot> We are on the front page, which means we have an influx of new people coming in here. Some are polite, some are not. Please let the mods handle those who are not. Sit back, enjoy the show, and DON'T FEED THE TROLLS.
[02/28/19, 11:08:21 AM] <Alexanderhero83> @mrcertainly yes
[02/28/19, 11:08:24 AM] <BrightWard> Wow! That’s an amazing scene!!! How big is this set?
[02/28/19, 11:08:29 AM] <ZachsMind> I dig how each episode this part of the set coincides with the setting. Previous series I've followed didn't change the look much from one episode to the next.
[02/28/19, 11:08:29 AM] <SilvanCosplay> @MrCertainly yes this originally aired on Alpha a few weeks ago
[02/28/19, 11:08:30 AM] <ImWastingLifeOnTwitch> @cinphoria ok thanks
[02/28/19, 11:08:41 AM] <chaoticloony> @VidDuality Each 2 part episode is a self contained adventure, but there is an season arc
[02/28/19, 11:08:43 AM] <TheDiMono> !respect
[02/28/19, 11:08:44 AM] <Nightbot> If you would like to share opinions on our hosts, guests or fellow viewers, please do so in a respectful manner. Don't make them feel uncomfortable.
[02/28/19, 11:08:46 AM] <Tripleyew> Praise the mods
[02/28/19, 11:08:50 AM] <swiftfingers> @BrightWard the set is amazing it changes every episode too

[02/28/19, 11:09:34 AM] <afishkiller> Question: The cast & the DM are wearing the same clothes as Ep1, which leads me to believe that this was shot on the same day. How long did it take to change the set dressing?
[02/28/19, 11:09:35 AM] <chaoticloony> @VidDuality Yes, but there is always a guest character

[02/28/19, 11:10:41 AM] <oK_Atom> I remember this
[02/28/19, 11:10:43 AM] <Alexanderhero83> Kill it with fire
[02/28/19, 11:10:44 AM] <CurtHong> It was on Alpha
[02/28/19, 11:10:45 AM] <MrCertainly> Serious questions -- which shows are on G&S that are actually live but aren't D&D or board games?
[02/28/19, 11:10:49 AM] <VidDuality> My D&D friend is going to be VERY happy I am watching this, hahaha. They've been trying to get me into it for a long time... XD
[02/28/19, 11:10:57 AM] <Dr_Neosage> Everything is legit Kappa
[02/28/19, 11:11:09 AM] <wildwest1> yeahhhhhh
[02/28/19, 11:11:09 AM] <ZachsMind> I saw this already over at Project Alpha, but these episodes encourage repeat viewing.
[02/28/19, 11:11:12 AM] <Yukarrr> I love this so much
[02/28/19, 11:11:19 AM] <swiftfingers> it's still on alpha @curthong, they have 3 or 4 episodes left to air
