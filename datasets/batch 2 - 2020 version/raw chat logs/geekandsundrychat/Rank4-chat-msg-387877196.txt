[02/28/19, 12:09:22 PM] <Shadow10380> @typebneg I wonder if he was kidding, because IMDB says, he was born in LA.
[02/28/19, 12:09:26 PM] <GamemasterAnth> So Wisteria has hysteria?
[02/28/19, 12:09:35 PM] <chaoticloony> Is that why Becca plays Bored Games?
[02/28/19, 12:09:41 PM] <swiftfingers> possibly @Critternation3000
[02/28/19, 12:09:47 PM] <typebneg> Maybe he was
[02/28/19, 12:09:59 PM] <KBTibbs> There was a four armed dressage session last week, it was epic

[02/28/19, 12:11:19 PM] <Lolthsmeat> sniff the rot
[02/28/19, 12:11:20 PM] <BookTea> I know it'd be almost difficult, but I wish Weave were a game available for solo players too...

[02/28/19, 12:11:35 PM] <chaoticloony> Would Vinelope's son be called, Poi Son?
[02/28/19, 12:11:41 PM] <JeffM0307> Also, she is not robbing a bank. :P
[02/28/19, 12:11:41 PM] <GamemasterAnth> Vinelope is definitely Dimir...
[02/28/19, 12:11:51 PM] <Zismarith> @BookTea Know the feeling.
[02/28/19, 12:11:55 PM] <ttaida> the question is ppl: It is worth it to get the project alpha suscription?
