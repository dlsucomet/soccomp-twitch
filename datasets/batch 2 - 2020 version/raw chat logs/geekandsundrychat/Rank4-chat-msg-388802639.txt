[03/2/19, 8:03:49 AM] <newMoonlight> ERIC?!?!?!
[03/2/19, 8:03:51 AM] <ZachsMind> Hi @MonteCookGames great to see you here. Silly question time: What are the odds a future book will get published that details the lore of Callisto6 and Superpunks co authored by Eric and Sam so folks can play their own games in this world too (using Cypher System obviously)? Asking for a friend.
[03/2/19, 8:03:52 AM] <demoquin163> role playing itake time but seriously after 1 year and half in the same game they should a least use they character name :)
[03/2/19, 8:03:54 AM] <darkhalfelf284> Everyone looks as fab as ever!
[03/2/19, 8:03:54 AM] <newMoonlight> WHY EVEN JOKE ABOUT BORG
