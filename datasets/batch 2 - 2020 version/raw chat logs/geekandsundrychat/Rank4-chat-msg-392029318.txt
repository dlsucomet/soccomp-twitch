[03/8/19, 10:11:09 AM] <white_rabbit16> MR FEENEY!!!!!!!!!!
[03/8/19, 10:11:16 AM] <Cynycal> and thus in the VODs
[03/8/19, 10:11:26 AM] <Roxin1> What cameras are they using for the closeups? thanks techies!
[03/8/19, 10:11:28 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> I loved Alpha quite a bit.

[03/8/19, 10:11:52 AM] <MadGodTom> CoolStoryBob
[03/8/19, 10:11:53 AM] <ResearchDump> I was subbed to alpha for a year
[03/8/19, 10:12:06 AM] <ResearchDump> Lots of good content
[03/8/19, 10:12:06 AM] <white_rabbit16> Will is the man!!!!
[03/8/19, 10:12:14 AM] <Cynycal> same I basically never bothered with using twitch to watch this content because i preferred alpha. With it going away at the end of this month though, here I am.
[03/8/19, 10:13:04 AM] <Cynycal> thats very cool, but probably not usable for the VODs right
[03/8/19, 10:13:17 AM] <TheDiMono> Correct, it only works while live
[03/8/19, 10:13:29 AM] <Cynycal> right, oh well
[03/8/19, 10:13:32 AM] <lambozor> does anyone know the creature they are painting?
[03/8/19, 10:13:35 AM] <SuperGimpoMan> When I was much younger I was taught all of this. Matt's doing a fine job explaining everything. :)
