[03/9/19, 8:02:27 AM] <renegadetortoise> I hope their dice business is on a roll
[03/9/19, 8:02:28 AM] <super390> Looks like later tonight Chaz is being hunted down like a dog.

[03/9/19, 8:02:46 AM] <philbe63> It looks like Eric is holding a resume
[03/9/19, 8:02:48 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Numenera is really fantastic
[03/9/19, 8:02:51 AM] <shidareAKI> Kostchie is very obviously chaotic neutral
[03/9/19, 8:02:59 AM] <Suedyin> Numenera is AWESOME for lost civilisation alien archeology
[03/9/19, 8:03:07 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Very evocative
[03/9/19, 8:03:15 AM] <Slippydude> @Chovexani I feel like Kostchie is as morally ambiguous and flexible and he is sexually ambiguous and flexible

[03/9/19, 8:03:47 AM] <Suedyin> but Torment: Numenera is right up there in my top 5 favourite games
[03/9/19, 8:03:49 AM] <rollingtheshots> Numenera as a system is good - started playing a group - and I'm loving it :)
[03/9/19, 8:03:57 AM] <shidareAKI> New systems are coooool

[03/9/19, 8:06:06 AM] <Slippydude> Hello Best Stream Cleric!!!
[03/9/19, 8:06:10 AM] <lexclesti> is that Chaz???
[03/9/19, 8:06:15 AM] <Chovexani> ... that sounds fun
[03/9/19, 8:06:16 AM] <swiftfingers> @deleyna I'm very ecited about this project, although it will likely be pro bono and I won't get anything back from it, being able to visit some of the oldest aged grotos in the tassilli massif and the first to have archeologically been found to have primitive ovens to fry crickets, snakes and scorpions for consumptions is dream come true
[03/9/19, 8:06:16 AM] <shidareAKI> @slippydude hiii
[03/9/19, 8:06:18 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Yes
[03/9/19, 8:06:21 AM] <super390> It≈õ what happens when you blow up Plastic Man.

[03/9/19, 8:06:48 AM] <Suedyin> @DarkestArgentum great to see you! :) yes @elizabethjoy77 Scots is a dialect, somewhere between contemporary English and full-on Gaelic

[03/9/19, 8:09:23 AM] <Suedyin> oooh TAILS! now I remember!
[03/9/19, 8:09:25 AM] <Celador_Mythica> How does this lady know so much about C6?
[03/9/19, 8:09:32 AM] <CinderFlame> TAILS gets news coverage?
[03/9/19, 8:09:35 AM] <ExcessiveWarlock> Oooh, Pyramid logo

[03/9/19, 8:09:54 AM] <Chovexani> Yo .. .Tails needs a good Head Start teacher or something
[03/9/19, 8:10:02 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @Celador_Mythica Hakim Sophia is a newscaster in LA
[03/9/19, 8:10:06 AM] <swiftfingers> @deleyna they're just holes dug in the walls of the caves, and they used them to cook what they could catch around, but the paintings in the caves also show that they were doing so, so from an archeological viewpoint it's fascinating, and being able to capture all of that in high resolution, 3d and do a virtual visit out of it would be awesome
[03/9/19, 8:10:08 AM] <PAPerryman> ramaFacepalm
[03/9/19, 8:10:09 AM] <Slippydude> @ZachsMind Channel 6
