[03/9/19, 11:58:40 AM] <MissNayoung> LA is a neat place. I got my first job there after college and a lot of my friends in Long Beach and Ramona Park threw me a congratulations/going away party.
[03/9/19, 11:58:44 AM] <TheOnyxPath> Many of LA by Night's characters (Abrams, Therese, Nines, Gary) come from the 2004 PC game Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. If people haven't played that, I highly recommend it.
