[03/15/19, 9:12:28 AM] <xpixl_gamingx> @broer I have a friend who has a 3d printer and prints his opwn, and they look pretty good. But the less expensive the printer, the less detail you get, I've found
[03/15/19, 9:12:37 AM] <Luke5342> @broer some has multiple pieces that you have to glue together
[03/15/19, 9:13:23 AM] <Massoline> @xpixl_gamingx @Luke5342 Thanks for answering, I was thinking that was some kind of wood shapping.
[03/15/19, 9:13:31 AM] <toastedcheetah> what are the painting.. is it a warmahordes model
