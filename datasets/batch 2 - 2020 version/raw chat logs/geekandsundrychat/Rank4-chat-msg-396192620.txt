[03/16/19, 11:08:06 AM] <Suedyin> Xander conveys the emotions of X so beautifully :)
[03/16/19, 11:08:07 AM] <AtariPinko> I always wonder in these situations how much of this is Storyteller and how much is player
[03/16/19, 11:08:07 AM] <Dragonchrome> !wtfisthis
[03/16/19, 11:08:08 AM] <Gerridwynn9> this....is a really long vision
[03/16/19, 11:08:08 AM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night.
[03/16/19, 11:08:09 AM] <RJLadyA> I need more tea for this to make sense.
[03/16/19, 11:08:11 AM] <vaeviktus90> That's what a REAL crown should look like. HEavy is the head

[03/16/19, 11:08:16 AM] <Shadowringa> Nelli and Victor use a Blue Heart
[03/16/19, 11:08:17 AM] <VermillionCrimson> A crown with a bullet? Sooooo barony = over? Das not a gud sign!
[03/16/19, 11:08:18 AM] <cy0nknight> That sounds like a broken king
[03/16/19, 11:08:19 AM] <Dragonchrome> !roleplay
[03/16/19, 11:08:19 AM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
