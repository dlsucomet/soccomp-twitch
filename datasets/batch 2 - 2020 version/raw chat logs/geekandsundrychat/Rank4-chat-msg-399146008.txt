[03/22/19, 9:05:27 AM] <TheDiMono> If the extra $5/mo breaks the bank, then you should probably hold off on subbing to either until you're in a better place financially
[03/22/19, 9:05:32 AM] <irlchaosdemon> CR is on at 7

[03/22/19, 9:07:50 AM] <TheDiMono> VODs are available for subs only
[03/22/19, 9:08:48 AM] <Danoba> @cthol24601 There's a collection of VODs for the show, but as DiMono said, you need to be subbed.
[03/22/19, 9:08:55 AM] <darkofnate> If you sub, you can find last week's video by just scrolling back in the VOD section. If you want something older, I think the mods put together a table of links?
[03/22/19, 9:08:57 AM] <TheDiMono> Nope
