[03/27/19, 7:01:11 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Ossborn
[03/27/19, 7:01:48 AM] <Ossborn> Hah... Trishs dress is awesome (as usual)!
[03/27/19, 7:02:01 AM] <Zismarith> gandsClassic The WiiU is the only Nintendo console I've never had. gandsTwenty
[03/27/19, 7:02:31 AM] <Ossborn> Same, there just were not enough games that made it reasonable to buy a WiiU
[03/27/19, 7:03:22 AM] <Zismarith> It's not as long as Super Street Fighter Gold Alpha Turbo 2 Collector's Edition: The Movie.
[03/27/19, 7:03:28 AM] <chaoticloony> I only miss Game Engine every other week while i'm at my Pathfinder game!
[03/27/19, 7:03:36 AM] <Ossborn> At the moment it´s more like Game Together, a subdivision of Game Engine :-D
[03/27/19, 7:04:33 AM] <AReisC13> hey
[03/27/19, 7:04:39 AM] <MrNY2Cali> and come E3 we'll have 2 new Switch versions
[03/27/19, 7:04:57 AM] <Ossborn> I´m also wearing glasses for about 2 weeks now.... kind of makes playing the Switch as portable much more enjoyable
[03/27/19, 7:05:07 AM] <chaoticloony> I had a Playstation, Nintendo and an N-64. I also had an Atari 2600!

[03/27/19, 7:05:15 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @AReisC13
[03/27/19, 7:05:20 AM] <Airace08> See these people gonna play a game?
[03/27/19, 7:05:27 AM] <Ossborn> Atari 2600 was my very first console too
[03/27/19, 7:05:42 AM] <Zismarith> ^
[03/27/19, 7:06:07 AM] <chaoticloony> Trisha, but CHAOS is so much more fun!
[03/27/19, 7:06:09 AM] <cinphoria> mine was the TurboGrafx-16 which NOBODY here knows. ...maybe Ossborn
[03/27/19, 7:06:31 AM] <Zismarith> Does may dad's Pong machine count? It wasn't mine, and I'm not sure if it counts as a console if it only has one game with 3 total sprites.
[03/27/19, 7:06:54 AM] <MrNY2Cali> 2600 -> SNES -> PS2 -> Wii - 3DS -> PS4 for me
[03/27/19, 7:07:12 AM] <cinphoria> TurboGrafx-16 -> .... nothing :P

[03/27/19, 7:08:31 AM] <MrNY2Cali> @GeekandSundry in 1992, the U.K.'s monarch decided that she should start paying taxes. ... Queen Elizabeth is responsible for income taxes, capital gains taxes, and a council tax for places of residence.
[03/27/19, 7:09:22 AM] <Ossborn> Well, Cinphoria, I heard that name at least
[03/27/19, 7:09:28 AM] <Morn_80> Morn_80 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[03/27/19, 7:09:33 AM] <chaoticloony> I am so enjoying this CHAOS!

[03/27/19, 7:09:57 AM] <Critternation3000> shishHI trisha shishHI EK shishHI kahail and Denise
[03/27/19, 7:10:07 AM] <Zismarith> Who could've known they'd play 8 seconds of game and stop to think about it? That, now, that's chaos theory.
[03/27/19, 7:10:09 AM] <Celador_Mythica> The first time I saw Trisha was on LA by Night. This is character shock.
[03/27/19, 7:10:22 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Not according to the Mario Bros movie you can't
[03/27/19, 7:10:23 AM] <Critternation3000> boosette ifdeezSquad

[03/27/19, 7:11:33 AM] <Critternation3000> linkette
[03/27/19, 7:11:47 AM] <cinphoria> screw the game we need to get to the bottom of this
[03/27/19, 7:11:49 AM] <Darastrygat> And if Princess Peach is a "fake princess thing".... does Mario know? Is he just attracted to trans mushrooms or is he in for a surprise someday?
[03/27/19, 7:11:59 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Only Toadette can use the crown.
[03/27/19, 7:12:19 AM] <chaoticloony> I so love the 4 of you together!
[03/27/19, 7:13:34 AM] <cinphoria> this game is so precious and pure
[03/27/19, 7:14:09 AM] <seratonia> I missed Game Engine so much
