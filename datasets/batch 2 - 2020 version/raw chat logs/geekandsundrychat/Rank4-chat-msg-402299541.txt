[03/28/19, 10:10:16 AM] <Punknaughtt2020> The additon of the trinkets is top notch makes every ep varied.
[03/28/19, 10:10:30 AM] <Deep50> I'm sure the key can open things if you set it to WUMBO.

[03/28/19, 10:10:51 AM] <Deathstar_Taco> as long as the thief in training doesn't get locked in their dependence on the key @Ronin903468
