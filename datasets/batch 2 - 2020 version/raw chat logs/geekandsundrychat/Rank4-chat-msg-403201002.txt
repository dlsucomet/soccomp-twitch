[03/30/19, 7:10:44 AM] <lord_whiteraven> woohoo I made it!!
[03/30/19, 7:10:46 AM] <Pandaikon0980> Excited!Sam is EXCITED! TwitchUnity gandsC6
[03/30/19, 7:10:49 AM] <FuffyButt> We are not robbing a museum,
[03/30/19, 7:10:56 AM] <Akeluus> ... And I know they can't say, for legal reasons, but we are *totally* stealing the Moon ;3 gandsC6 <3
[03/30/19, 7:10:56 AM] <SakuraDreamerz> SPAAAAAACE!
[03/30/19, 7:10:57 AM] <MonteCookGames> I'm thinking it's intentional distortion? Eeek!
[03/30/19, 7:10:59 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @ZachsMind reload it's fine
[03/30/19, 7:11:00 AM] <JeffM0307> We are not robbing a Markeia
[03/30/19, 7:11:08 AM] <lemoneaterl> I think I switched my Alpha sub to twitch? But I still don't see it in my account
[03/30/19, 7:11:18 AM] <NinjaPenguinAM> Every episode keeps reminding me I need to get my Cass cosplay together but I keep not working on it and working on other cosplays
[03/30/19, 7:11:20 AM] <Ossborn> Markeia is hiding the moon under that haircut!
[03/30/19, 7:11:24 AM] <KBTibbs> Who are you Hakeem Sophia. What is the nature of your existence. Are you god?
[03/30/19, 7:11:25 AM] <Celador_Mythica> Con Crud is the real supervillain
[03/30/19, 7:11:26 AM] <seratonia> Oh man that intro Markeia
[03/30/19, 7:11:29 AM] <Akeluus> Hydrate! Hygene!
[03/30/19, 7:11:33 AM] <lemoneaterl> bold topknot choice, hakeem
[03/30/19, 7:11:45 AM] <mjrider> @darkestargentum I thought they were grandfathered because Im pretty sure that rule came into effect after alpha....ðŸ¥´
[03/30/19, 7:11:46 AM] <highvoltage988> there's so much on Alpha I wanted to see but never could afford to (or squeeze it all into a free trial period). Apparently it's coming to Twitch now, and thanks to Prime sub I may finally be able to catch it all
[03/30/19, 7:11:47 AM] <JeffM0307> What's with the coconut hat?
[03/30/19, 7:11:52 AM] <VermillionCrimson> That's not a topknot, that's a topball!
[03/30/19, 7:12:06 AM] <chaoticloony> Markeia's hair always looks so great
[03/30/19, 7:12:07 AM] <mjrider> Could be wrong...
[03/30/19, 7:12:17 AM] <EricaTheStrange> I think she is something like tails or maybe this has all already happened and she is just the narrator @KBTibbs
[03/30/19, 7:12:18 AM] <KBTibbs> Markeia is very fashionable.
[03/30/19, 7:12:19 AM] <lemoneaterl> @VermillionCrimson indeed
[03/30/19, 7:12:26 AM] ** ZachsMind inserts space sphere from portal two into chat room so it randomly floats around our heads screaming SPAAAACE I'm in Space!!!
[03/30/19, 7:12:26 AM] <boone_faustus> Cass breaks all the barriers
[03/30/19, 7:12:27 AM] <super390> I think Markeia is growing an extra brain which is how she knows everything that's going on.
[03/30/19, 7:12:35 AM] <MissMystic31> GINA!
[03/30/19, 7:12:41 AM] ** EricaTheStrange pats Sam on the back
[03/30/19, 7:12:42 AM] <shidareAKI> gandsFacepalm
[03/30/19, 7:12:42 AM] <captainsthunder> EXCUSE ME?
