[04/10/19, 7:02:23 AM] <Nightbot> From the Deck of Many comes Humblewood, an exciting campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition now live on Kickstarter. Humblewood includes original birdfolk player races (like the crow-like Corvum, or the owl-like Strig), to new monsters, magic items, and even a compelling adventure for 1st to 5th level characters.

[04/10/19, 7:05:30 AM] <starpilotsix> If LDN tries to tell you this game counts as your vacation time, don't let them. ;)

[04/10/19, 7:06:42 AM] <cinphoria> "human vacations"? what's the other choice?
[04/10/19, 7:06:56 AM] <cinphoria> can i have a cat vacation
[04/10/19, 7:07:11 AM] <EricaTheStrange> A blank cheque reboot would be a homeless immigrant getting a cheque for 1 billion dollars
[04/10/19, 7:07:24 AM] <cinphoria> oh that would be so heartwarming
[04/10/19, 7:07:37 AM] <zetasubject> Erika was on about Richie Rich with his home Macy Ds
[04/10/19, 7:07:40 AM] <chaoticloony> I was a Gaming con vacationer
[04/10/19, 7:08:14 AM] <Zismarith> I do kinda expect Erika to just run shrieking down the street, and what she finds, she finds.
[04/10/19, 7:08:45 AM] <ryan_witalison> Good thing this isn't a horror game, that head set would be across the room by now
[04/10/19, 7:08:52 AM] <webbyghost> I don't remember the last vacation i had
[04/10/19, 7:09:03 AM] <cinphoria> SMOL MODE

[04/10/19, 7:14:05 AM] <cinphoria> It snowed here today, in April, and I was so mad.
[04/10/19, 7:14:11 AM] <RileyOMalley> I want to head out to my local parks/forests again. I've been so stoked that the weather has been sunny again. That snow and muddy weather was really bumming me out
