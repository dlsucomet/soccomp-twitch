[04/11/19, 11:27:47 AM] <Zismarith> I just accidentally ran into the folder where my Steam screenshots are kept.
[04/11/19, 11:28:16 AM] <Zismarith> One of them is for Master of Orion (2015). Good game. Weird that a random picture of Felicia Day is in there.

[04/11/19, 11:29:08 AM] <chaoticloony> @Zismarith It is a very fun game
[04/11/19, 11:29:22 AM] <akhenatron> Still don't understand why the name change to allow other rpgs only to always play weave anyway lol.
[04/11/19, 11:29:33 AM] <Feor1300> hmm, if Twitter is to be believed this is going to be like their 3rd or 4th game inspired by Labyrinth lol
[04/11/19, 11:30:12 AM] <chaoticloony> @akhenatron They did a wrestling game under the title too one Friday
[04/11/19, 11:30:14 AM] <Feor1300> @akhenatron I think the idea was that there was going to be a bunch of shows running under the "TBD RPG" banner, and this one would usually play Weave
[04/11/19, 11:30:25 AM] ** Lei_Hng_Wei hands out PopCorn
[04/11/19, 11:30:26 AM] <Zismarith> @chaoticloony One of my favorite "one more round" games. Like Civilization but with lasers. I just don't remember Felicia being in there to be screenshot'd.

[04/11/19, 11:34:08 AM] <chaoticloony> Just remember that although many of the hosts of the channel are attractive, there's much more to them than that. For example, Whitney is metal af.

[04/11/19, 11:35:19 AM] <JeffM0307> !roleplay
[04/11/19, 11:35:19 AM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[04/11/19, 11:35:21 AM] <Danoba> Hey @16bitEric
