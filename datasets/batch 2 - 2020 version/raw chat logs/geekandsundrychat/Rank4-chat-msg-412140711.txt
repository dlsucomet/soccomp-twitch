[04/17/19, 7:02:55 AM] <GarthMcMurray> Hi everyone!
[04/17/19, 7:02:57 AM] <Ossborn> thuluHEY Khail thuluHEY Trish thuluHEY Erika thuluHEY Denise
[04/17/19, 7:03:28 AM] <GarthMcMurray> I love Trisha's periodic table of elements pants
[04/17/19, 7:03:36 AM] <MrNY2Cali> News PS5 specs
[04/17/19, 7:03:41 AM] <Ossborn> So a scary game.... controllers that can be thrown.... Erika is there.... and you don´t wear protective gear? Fools! :-P
[04/17/19, 7:04:35 AM] <GarthMcMurray> Mandalorian looks cool.
[04/17/19, 7:05:19 AM] <Ossborn> I do not fully trust it... a singleplayer game, no microtransaction..... It´s a trap!?
[04/17/19, 7:07:37 AM] <GarthMcMurray> It's also $69.99 per year
[04/17/19, 7:08:27 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Trish is very retro
[04/17/19, 7:09:13 AM] <ApatrosMiner> All those games have been free *on the internet* for well over ten years... real annoying
[04/17/19, 7:11:05 AM] <GarthMcMurray> Sure. My friend has a cheap joystick with a bunch of games like Asteroids, Centipede, Galaga, etc
[04/17/19, 7:11:43 AM] <DQoder> Yes, if I'm able to use the stick on my ps4 or pc as well
[04/17/19, 7:11:54 AM] <zetasubject> Will it be another limited supply? Run out before the normals can buy one
[04/17/19, 7:12:46 AM] <davidflegel> I can't believe that Erika is busy. It's not like she spends her weekend raising $20,600 for charity or anything.
[04/17/19, 7:12:46 AM] <ApatrosMiner> I don't need any of those games - how bout they make a NEW Dark Stalkers, that I'd pay for
[04/17/19, 7:13:02 AM] <Ossborn> There were just 3 or 4 titles in that list Trish read that would be interesting for me, so I dont think I would buy that stick... if it can be used as a controller foe PC or PS4 though
[04/17/19, 7:13:14 AM] <Ossborn> ... I would be more interested
[04/17/19, 7:14:16 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Sony over the last few years has mandated Accessibility as its part of the platform, and as a disabled gamer its the main reason why Playstation is my top gaming platform

[04/17/19, 7:14:56 AM] <sigma682> Some movies are shot in IMAX but some of us don’t have IMAX at home
[04/17/19, 7:15:04 AM] <GarthMcMurray> I would equate it with Anime movies some people like it in original Japanese, some like subtitles with the Japanese audio, and some like it dubbed in English
[04/17/19, 7:15:29 AM] <starpilotsix> Historically most movies did compromise for a wider, even younger audience... by censoring swear words so it could air on broadcast television.
[04/17/19, 7:15:44 AM] <ApatrosMiner> IF they choose to make their art accessible, then that is the art
[04/17/19, 7:16:04 AM] <bubbaphatt> Microsoft has made a LOT of progress on Accessibility. their Adaptive Controller is incredibly configurable
[04/17/19, 7:17:02 AM] <bubbaphatt> as VR matures, though, controllers to some degree will kinda disappear
[04/17/19, 7:17:33 AM] <MrNY2Cali> And ableGamers has published a template now for developers to use based on research/surveys so more gamedevs should be making more accessible games going forward
[04/17/19, 7:17:34 AM] <Gkgamerfan> "you cheated not only the game but yourself" meme here
[04/17/19, 7:18:02 AM] <Hyperspace_Beast> @stikkbomber on the contrary, controllers would become more advanced
[04/17/19, 7:18:32 AM] <KaiOrAya> I see the reduced difficulty/story mode as more like removing obstacles for folks to getting to the story. To me it's a bit more like closed captioning at movies. It makes it so groups who would otherwise miss out on the story because they can't access all of it able to access it
[04/17/19, 7:18:38 AM] <FuffyButt> hello peopo
[04/17/19, 7:19:10 AM] <shidareAKI> yo Fuffy
[04/17/19, 7:19:28 AM] <ON514UGHT> Baka
[04/17/19, 7:19:48 AM] <ApatrosMiner> I'm with Khail, but as long as it doesn't affect the other modes, I'm cool with it
[04/17/19, 7:19:52 AM] <FuffyButt> so is Denise a official host now?
[04/17/19, 7:20:10 AM] <starpilotsix> If I read Moby Dick, I can skim the sections that are just extended descriptions of whaling, if I want to. If I watch a horror movie, I can skip the gore by covering my eyes. Most art allows us to experience it in ways that miss the intended effect.

[04/17/19, 7:20:45 AM] <MrNY2Cali> since consoles are basically computers now, there aren't real limits on "features" anymore. There will be limits for studios who can't afford to put in all the accessiblity features for each type of disabled consumer
[04/17/19, 7:21:22 AM] <sigma682> I didn’t pay $60 to play a game that I can’t progress in...
[04/17/19, 7:21:25 AM] <GarthMcMurray> The accessible mode could also bring in younger or inexperienced gamers who could then up the difficulty level once they get better
[04/17/19, 7:21:41 AM] <MrNY2Cali> One persons Normal Mode is another persons Hard Mode
[04/17/19, 7:21:48 AM] <Lone_Hobbit> if more options help devs sell more games then its good
[04/17/19, 7:21:53 AM] <KaiOrAya> @sigma682 Same
[04/17/19, 7:22:30 AM] <MissMurderlol> I agree with khail. Not everything needs an easy mode
[04/17/19, 7:23:08 AM] <Ossborn> And I beat the Melee Island Swordmaster without using a curse guide :-D
[04/17/19, 7:23:18 AM] <bubbaphatt> @Hyperspace_Beast for some game genres, absolutely. for some more "casual" games i can see a point where controllers would be almost unnecessary. then again wahdoino, i'm not a game user interface guru developer gawd
[04/17/19, 7:23:28 AM] <FuffyButt> Video game director cuts.
[04/17/19, 7:23:56 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Difficulty is not necessary an accessibility thing, if there are other options that allow more players to enjoy the gaming
[04/17/19, 7:24:51 AM] <FuffyButt> i watch people better then on the internets

[04/17/19, 7:24:58 AM] <GarthMcMurray> Another example... gyms have machines & classes for advanced people, but some stick to treadmills & dumbbells
