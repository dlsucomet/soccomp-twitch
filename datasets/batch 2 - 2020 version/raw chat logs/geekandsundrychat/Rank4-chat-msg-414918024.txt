[04/23/19, 3:07:19 AM] <lostthenumbers> Last night's episode was SO good
[04/23/19, 3:07:25 AM] <Danoba> It was indeed.
[04/23/19, 3:07:36 AM] <The_TBoyce> SO SO good!
[04/23/19, 3:07:36 AM] <Geekouts> @lostthenumbers agreed
[04/23/19, 3:07:41 AM] <shidareAKI> It was friggin excellent
[04/23/19, 3:07:42 AM] <Its_a_me_Bondo> seemed like a say goodbye episode
[04/23/19, 3:07:48 AM] <Andyinsomnia> Yeah last night was great, so many good moments
[04/23/19, 3:07:51 AM] <Its_a_me_Bondo> all the characters getting together
[04/23/19, 3:07:52 AM] <shidareAKI> I cried

[04/23/19, 3:08:03 AM] <Its_a_me_Bondo> next week is going to get nasty I'd think
[04/23/19, 3:08:04 AM] <shidareAKI> Twice
[04/23/19, 3:08:08 AM] <zenArc> really enjoyed this ep. obsoleted ep 1 for me
[04/23/19, 3:08:41 AM] <The_TBoyce> I didn't cry, but during Brienne's big moment, I was cheering like a football fan! <3 <3
[04/23/19, 3:09:02 AM] <Geekouts> the first two episodes seem like they are setting the board up for the rest of the season. Every episode left is over an hour in length. I don't understand the logic of using the crypt as sanctuary (In normal warfare sure but an undead invasion?)
[04/23/19, 3:09:16 AM] <zenArc> @The_TBoyce i was bawling BibleThump
[04/23/19, 3:09:18 AM] <The_TBoyce> @Bondo___ Yup, it's talking with all the BioWare companions before the final boss fight.
[04/23/19, 3:09:29 AM] <Geekouts> also excited to see Arya's weapon in action
[04/23/19, 3:09:48 AM] <Its_a_me_Bondo> @The_TBoyce lol yep back to the ship one more time
[04/23/19, 3:09:53 AM] <The_TBoyce> "A Euron-ary tract infection"...oh Dan... FailFish
[04/23/19, 3:09:54 AM] <Geekouts> The knighting scene made me cry
[04/23/19, 3:09:58 AM] <shidareAKI> Hysterical pregnancy is a thing
[04/23/19, 3:10:01 AM] <Cyanbw> Yeah the crypts seems like the worst place lol
[04/23/19, 3:10:17 AM] <zenArc> is arya able to pose as the hound after he dies? cleganebowl but it's her?
[04/23/19, 3:10:25 AM] <The_TBoyce> @Cyanbw It's a Stark family reunion! :D :(
[04/23/19, 3:10:38 AM] <Andyinsomnia> A lot of people have said the crypt is a poor choice but white walkers have to get fairly close to wight people. like if they are close enough to turn all the dead starks there is pretty much nowhere safe up north left anyway
[04/23/19, 3:10:50 AM] <Cyanbw> Indeed! @The_TBoyce
[04/23/19, 3:11:20 AM] <zenArc> @Andyinsomnia or melisandre will raise r'hllor zambies?
[04/23/19, 3:11:27 AM] <The_TBoyce> I *loved* that dragonriding scene. It was a dance of dragons...in more ways than one.
[04/23/19, 3:11:29 AM] <Geekouts> @andyinsomnia that is a good point
[04/23/19, 3:12:21 AM] <Geekouts> Lady mormont is a bad ass
[04/23/19, 3:12:39 AM] <zenArc> @The_TBoyce it didn't do anything for me, but it may just be setting up for dragon jousting. isn't there an old legend about two targs fighting atop dragons?
[04/23/19, 3:12:40 AM] <Geekouts> I'm rewatching episode 2 now
[04/23/19, 3:12:41 AM] <The_TBoyce> So question for chat: how would YOU spend the night before the Battle of Winterfell?
[04/23/19, 3:12:45 AM] <shidareAKI> The need to own Jaime is always relevant.
[04/23/19, 3:12:53 AM] <Danoba> Show is starting in just a minute.
[04/23/19, 3:13:15 AM] <HanusaurusRex> @The_TBoyce probably riding my horse down to Dorne
[04/23/19, 3:13:22 AM] <Geekouts> Definitely in the main hall, seems the best option. @the_tboyce how about you?
[04/23/19, 3:13:44 AM] <The_TBoyce> @zenarc Jousting? No, but Daemon Targaryen ("The Rogue Prince") killed Aemond the Kinslayer and Vhagar while riding Daemon's dragon Caraxes.
[04/23/19, 3:14:21 AM] <The_TBoyce> @Geekouts Ideally, spending it with the person I love most in the world. Realistically, probably reading, alone. :D
