[04/24/19, 11:32:09 AM] <robinhood996> well in my opinion voiceover is more really voice-acting since you live a character the same way in a game than in a movie
[04/24/19, 11:32:09 AM] <steelneko> And now you're both Fire Emblem characters! :D

[04/24/19, 11:32:12 AM] <ericastrange> When Trisha's child starts running around the playground saying to other kids that they're a hanzo main then something has worked
[04/24/19, 11:32:13 AM] <chaoticloony> Trisha's substitute swears are so cool!
[04/24/19, 11:32:13 AM] <shidareAKI> It's a lot of a fun consonants

[04/24/19, 11:32:20 AM] <tea_cake_and_gaming> Question: I know I've asked this before, but can you get Game Engine / Geek & Sundry to London MCM Comic Con? You could aim to get to the UK May 2020. ;)
[04/24/19, 11:32:20 AM] <chaoticloony> On Game Engine, you don't NEED to be good at a game to have fun!
[04/24/19, 11:32:20 AM] <AndyMyles> yes
[04/24/19, 11:32:20 AM] <Maihel> No

[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <zetasubject> His apprentice
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <BustaTunez> Frost was Sub-Zero's trainee, but she rebelled because SZ decided to align with Scorpion's people
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <gabrielxdesign> Frost is Sub-Zero's apprentice
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <Prick_James> I wish battle damage somewhat persisted
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <gabrielxdesign> That's not the way to treat you'r mentor
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <chaoticloony> Talk about some Cold Hearted characters in this fight!
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <ravienl33t> The whole point of Frost's creation is because they wanted to expand on Sub Zero's abilities because it was rather vague on his ice abilities with the exception of "he can shoot ice".
[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <zetasubject> Batman Nightwing great master apprentice

[04/24/19, 11:32:21 AM] <gabrielxdesign> Frost and Sub-Zero fighting in a volcano, that's not right
[04/24/19, 11:32:22 AM] <Critternation3000> Frost combos are pretty cold
[04/24/19, 11:32:22 AM] <Prick_James> Cheeeese

[04/24/19, 11:32:23 AM] <tea_cake_and_gaming> There are some actors who cannot watch or listen to themselves too.
