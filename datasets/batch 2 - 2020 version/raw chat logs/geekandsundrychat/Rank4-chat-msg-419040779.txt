[05/2/19, 5:05:18 AM] <Ossborn> Capes are fun, until you get to close to a plane engine :-P
[05/2/19, 5:05:24 AM] <Ossborn> NO CAPES!
[05/2/19, 5:05:38 AM] <PAPerryman> I'll never get that image out of my head, Oss
[05/2/19, 5:05:51 AM] <ShandraVdeG> No capes!
[05/2/19, 5:05:57 AM] <Ossborn> Exactly ^^
[05/2/19, 5:06:37 AM] <ericastrange> I just watched a documentary about the Savoy Hotel, this feels like what it would look like if they made a gaming room.
[05/2/19, 5:07:34 AM] <Zismarith> Danoba plays Fortnite?

[05/2/19, 5:09:10 AM] <Ossborn> thuluHEY
[05/2/19, 5:09:35 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> DOnt land in tilted towers?
[05/2/19, 5:09:53 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Building is crucial
[05/2/19, 5:10:06 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Materials are your friend
[05/2/19, 5:10:10 AM] <gravey_boy69> its the worse place to land
[05/2/19, 5:10:31 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Hit the trees and rocks and stuff!!
[05/2/19, 5:10:38 AM] <ericastrange> Parents pay people to teach their kids how to play Fortnite just so you know
[05/2/19, 5:11:07 AM] <Ossborn> All I know about this game is that my son plays it and it seems to include a lot of shBEEPt talk... I always close all doors between us, when he plays it

[05/2/19, 5:11:23 AM] <Nydissa> You need to destroy things in the environment to get resources to build
[05/2/19, 5:11:28 AM] <gravey_boy69> its the world biggest game right now i dont like it but i play it sometimes
[05/2/19, 5:11:30 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Please hit at least one tree with your pickaxe cause you need materials to build haha
[05/2/19, 5:12:01 AM] <gravey_boy69> lol
[05/2/19, 5:12:05 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> Also head to the eye of the storm its a safe place but it also has all the other people
[05/2/19, 5:12:13 AM] <ericastrange> The shbeep sounds like a fun jazz dance @Ossborn
[05/2/19, 5:12:18 AM] <Critternation3000> gns plays fortnite crazy
[05/2/19, 5:12:41 AM] <gravey_boy69> yeah keep an eye on the map go to where the white circle on your map
[05/2/19, 5:12:45 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> The white line is the shortest path to the eye of the storm :)
[05/2/19, 5:12:47 AM] <Ossborn> @ericastrange Don´t tell Epic Games, or they steal the idea from you ;-)
[05/2/19, 5:12:50 AM] <gravey_boy69> follow to white line
[05/2/19, 5:12:52 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> YOU TAKE FALL DAMAGE
[05/2/19, 5:13:09 AM] <ericastrange> To late @Ossborn
[05/2/19, 5:13:17 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> You also take damage by being in the storm
[05/2/19, 5:13:19 AM] <Nydissa> You're taking damage
[05/2/19, 5:13:21 AM] <Critternation3000> did yall do the Thanos mode?
[05/2/19, 5:13:23 AM] <Nydissa> Outside the eye
[05/2/19, 5:13:43 AM] <Ossborn> The deadly part isnt the falling, it´s the abrupt stop at the end!
[05/2/19, 5:13:53 AM] <Shadowstorm_0> My little brother is really good at this game so I have been forced to learn many a thing about it xD
[05/2/19, 5:13:58 AM] <ericastrange> So they didn't name it the Thanus mode @Critternation3000
[05/2/19, 5:14:26 AM] <Ossborn> English in chat please
