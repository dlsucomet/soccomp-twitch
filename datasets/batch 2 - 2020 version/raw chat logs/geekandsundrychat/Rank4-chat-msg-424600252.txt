[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <darkofnate> Danobagain?
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Only Genova except on twitch
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Yes
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Triage
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> What could go wrong
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Awww yeeeah
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> It’s ok. I think they might have camped
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <OMGsteveFTW> OMGsteveFTW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 81 months, currently on a 51 month streak! woohoo!
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> That was a better round
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Good job keeping the fire rate up and staying out of the danger zone
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> You were doing fine. Really
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Meh
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Hey same here.
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> You guys are putting a lot of pressure on yourselves. Your team wasn’t giving you a lot of support
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> That is cool
[05/14/19, 11:12:35 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> They seem to be staying around you more and you are definitely doing better
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Thanks I try
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> #LearnFromMyMistakes
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I kinda suck at first person shooters so I don’t judge
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> I’m awful at them
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Third person mode all the way
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> it just occurred to me i haven't played overwatch in like 5 months
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> >.>
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> I have NEVER played Overwatch
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Me neither
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> I basically can't play First Person games anymore (motion sickness).
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> 7? 7
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> i'm gonna see if this computer can even play overwatch
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Also, hi @darkofnate :)
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> Mirror's Edge made me violently ill
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> Hey Aki
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> "one little Danoba" aww
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Also in case people in chat didn’t know, yesterday was Danoba’s birthday!
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> And hey Cin
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> hey darkofnate
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> And happy birthday again, Devon.
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> lol even their healers have healers
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Rip
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <shidareAKI> Playing over watch poorly HA
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Obviously. Yeah. It’s an older game so people who still play will likely be more seasoned than most
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <grimvonhamzel> grimvonhamzel subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <darkofnate> Even though I don't play, it's always fun to watch Overwatch gamers panic and get despair.
[05/14/19, 11:12:36 AM] <cinphoria> it's true
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <shidareAKI> Hey, I’d still say y’all are doing better than I ever could
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> ^^^
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <shidareAKI> !mondays
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> I thought people were overreacting on Twitter, but I just finished watching it, and...yeah...
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <shidareAKI> The cinematography was so frickin stellar though and that cannot be argued
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> There's another episode, which could justify everything. Maybe.
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I have no words for it.
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> It’s been amazing
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <cinphoria> verdict: this computer can't play overwatch and watch twitch at the same time, at the very least
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <bandstander> How are you
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> I'm thinking of troll sentences to make them say, but they all seem too mean ;)
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> They’re just frustrated.
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <DriveFrew> Someone had a birthday or something
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Geekouts> SAving Throw Show's New Pantheon had their second episode and it was more enjoyable than GoT
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> ^ ^ ^
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Geekouts> That is on Sundays
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <DriveFrew> Whattup, gang!
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <shidareAKI> tries not to be a blushmonster
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <DriveFrew> Popping in to say hey before I go drink Bud Light and play mini golf, yay Florida!
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <darkofnate> Condolences on drinking Bud Light...
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Geekouts> Huzzah for mini golf
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <shidareAKI> I feel like this is going well...
[05/14/19, 11:12:37 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Someone is actually using the ice wall effectively

[05/14/19, 11:12:38 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Guys so long as you’re having fun I’m happy to watch you play. Sorry it’s not turning out like you hoped. I’m grateful that you guys are still streaming regardless
