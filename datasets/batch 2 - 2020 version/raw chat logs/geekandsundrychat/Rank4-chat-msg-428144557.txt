[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry you may want to warn people in this community how dark and gory this game gets. No offense.
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> this game goes from 0-100 real quick
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <xmarysuex> I learned about that from the Ella Enchanted book
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <chaoticloony> Loot first, then chat!
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <xmarysuex> welp in in. let's go ladies
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry I have beaten this game and it is amazing. If the lady with you is a creator of the game, then tell her I love it
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> the game is fire
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> sometimes literally
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <gamingfan30> thanks for the heads up on this stream
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> When we studied the late Middle Ages in AP Euro History, we were taught it was a combination of multiple crises: the Great Famine, the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, and the War of the Roses, among others.
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> I will say the game sound is a little low. You may want to turn it up or add subtitles
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> Uh oh...this guys looks like bad news.
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <gamingfan30> i agree matthewory
[05/22/19, 11:35:05 AM] <MatthewOry> Dad is gone :(

[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <cinphoria> that sounds like a smol
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <cinphoria> don't go in the tall grass without your pokemon, or a mom
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <FuffyButt> Mrs Pac is a mom game
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <EricaTheStrange> I think this is more of a sister,care taker game, just like Kara in Detroit Become Human
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <xmarysuex> o God. what happens if you just cower and cry?
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> @EricaTheStrange Aw, Kara and Alice... <3 <3
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Those pre-plague french ninjas.
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> Oh, wait: doesn't Kara from "Detroit: Become Human" count as a mom?!?
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <chaoticloony> Mom was originally a rogue?
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <xmarysuex> mom skills, of course. ain't never met anyone as stealthy as mom
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry I will say at the end of chapter 3 the frame rate may become an issue. Not trying to spoil, just the game gets busy.
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <BRETT___RIVERBOAT> 2 fps
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <FuffyButt> mom has a secret stash of ninja tools she needs to get

[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> So does Hugo really have the bubonic plague, or is it a different disease?
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <chaoticloony> My hands aren't good enough to hold my breathe. :)
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <Critternation3000> jcvimHi trisha jcvimHi denise
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Yes, cram the child through the hole.
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <MatthewOry> Hugo = driving your emotions up and down throughout the game.
[05/22/19, 11:35:07 AM] <EricaTheStrange> They cram them up chimney in a few hundred years so a small hole is nbd @BeardtasticYogi
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <MatthewOry> lol
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> RUN!

[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <cinphoria> no one expects the Spanish Inquisition
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> @FuffyButt How could you suspect them? No one suspects the Spanish Inquisition!
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Is it the Dragon Age Inquisition @FuffyButt
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> @cinphoria Beat me to it. :D
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <cinphoria> :3
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry the pacing on how you learn things in this game is great. Game of thrones could of used their pacing
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <chaoticloony> Just keep the Comfy chair away from me!
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <MatthewOry> for the last season
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> @EricaTheStrange The *best* Inquisition!
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <xmarysuex> are there hulks in this game? kiddo looks little green
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> @chaoticloony We'd try the Soft Cushions first.
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> *climbs through window* "Peace out, Hugo!"
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <xmarysuex> hulk
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <chaoticloony> @The_TBoyce I can barely tolerate that
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <The_TBoyce> Is Hugo a witch? Does he weigh as much as or less than a duck?
[05/22/19, 11:35:08 AM] <FuffyButt> i think hugo has epilepsy
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <EricaTheStrange> I think Hugo has the shining, that's what grounds keeper Willie would say.
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <The_TBoyce> I promised Monty Python jokes today, and I deliver on my promises! :D

[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <The_TBoyce> To paraphrase a popular saying about Dungeon Masters: "When the Inquisition soldier sees you, it's already too late."
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <FuffyButt> MOM noooooo
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <MatthewOry> just walk forward lol
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <Zismarith> And THAT is why escort quests never work. Is this a 16 hour long escort?
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Mom probably thought, "Well, where Hugo, I go."
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <Critternation3000> ramaRage mom why
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <EricaTheStrange> They've turned this game into a death simulator

[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <Zismarith> @EricaTheStrange Which in turn is why I need my escort missions to involve laser cannons and sword fights.
[05/22/19, 11:35:09 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry Hugo makes you want to leave him behind every now and then lol
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <FuffyButt> stop smothering Hugo, he needs to learn how hide from murders
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <chaoticloony> I try to avoid escort missions in Battletech
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <MatthewOry> Anyone tense?
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <MatthewOry> @chaoticloony ditto
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <The_TBoyce> sings, "Turn around! Every now and then, I have a little Inquisition trying to hunt me down. Turn around...!"
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <JeffM0307> Another video game escort mission from Hell
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <MatthewOry> i need to get back on my battletech grind
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <EricaTheStrange> They've had that in games to, when that happens the person you are escorting runs in front of the bad guys while you are shooting at them @Zismarith
[05/22/19, 11:35:10 AM] <MatthewOry> @JeffM0307 thats the whole game lol

[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <SenatraGG> I know the game but early accesses r ready to play at console actually thats why I asked
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <FuffyButt> careful of the chickens. don't hurt them
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <SenatraGG> why? cause I have never seen it drops that much fps
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Is it an actual child or an adult doing Hugo's voice?
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <The_TBoyce> Is that going to be our name for Hugo from now on? "Our Little Pumpkin"?
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <cinphoria> if it's an adult then they're made of magic, because that little kid lisp is hard to replicate
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <Critternation3000> @ericathestrange typically adults VA kids in games
[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <Paladin356> they are

[05/22/19, 11:35:13 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Depends on how big the actor sometimes.

[05/22/19, 11:35:14 AM] <MissNayoung> Right. Hugo is voiced by an actual child.
[05/22/19, 11:35:14 AM] <The_TBoyce> It doesn't say how old Logan is, though.
[05/22/19, 11:35:14 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry both Amicia and Hugo are first time voice actors.
[05/22/19, 11:35:14 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Hi @Paladin356 58 month sub hype

[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <The_TBoyce> @EricaTheStrange Fair enough.
[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <MatthewOry> control is stealth toss @GeekandSundry

[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <SenatraGG> btw @MatthewOry first time actors are always better than a fews. sure experts are better but think of 4-5 times actored and the first one is better
[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <MatthewOry> @SenatraGG had no idea. that is cool
[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Tommy Lee Jones had a good line in the first MIB film "A person is smart, people are stupid" @The_TBoyce
[05/22/19, 11:35:15 AM] <chaoticloony> Can we call Hugo a "Run"t? :)

[05/22/19, 11:35:16 AM] <The_TBoyce> And get ready to run, I assume.

[05/22/19, 11:35:19 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry Searching for all the ingredients you see later is a big part of the game. If you miss stuff early on it can delay upgrades and make the game a bit harder.

[05/22/19, 11:35:20 AM] <MatthewOry> Oh! It's Aquitaine, France which is southwest France. I said north cause the English soldiers are part of the game.

[05/22/19, 11:35:21 AM] <darkofnate> Why are they pitting this young girl against a Dark Souls boss????

[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <joker_joe0021> Is this game dropping frames or is it just me?
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <EricaTheStrange> It's like he's saying i am going to kill you i fought in two wars, that's how good at killing i am
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> I mean, there wasn't much in ways of entertainment in those days.
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <The_TBoyce> You may have fought in two wars, but we've fought you at least a half dozen times!
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry only need 5 successful rock hits
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <chaoticloony> Luck is a viable tactic!
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <dayntee> What we don't know is whether or not those two wars were against teenage girls. Otherwise, his experience is clearly irrelevant
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry You need to hold down the trigger to start spinning the sling before he turns
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <JeffM0307> LOL
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <chaoticloony> I so love Trisha's "cursing"!
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <MatthewOry> yep
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <The_TBoyce> I am calm! I am focused! I am determined! shishWW shishWW

[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> I think now you aim for his chest.
[05/22/19, 11:35:23 AM] <MatthewOry> he gets faster and faster
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> just watch :D
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> you do aim for his chest
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <EricaTheStrange> What happens when your child starts using your clean swears and the teachers at school still give them trouble over it?
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <darkofnate> Wait, I'm confused. How many wars has he fought in?
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <dayntee> oh, he is running at ya now
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> back of the neck now
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> He will start panting after a few swings and you can target his neck
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> Or maybe the only thing he had was that armor.
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> he doesnt do stuck in the mud swing anymore
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <Paladin356> lol,
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> just gotta turn and get him in the face

[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Go go Trisha's Anger
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> lol
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> @The_TBoyce That was great
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <EricaTheStrange> His two wars are the first war and the second war
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> Stuck in the mud is done after 3rd hit
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <darkofnate> Maybe he wasn't wearing the armor in those two wars; that's why he was more effective...
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> i just dont wanna spoil the game and make it ez
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> nope
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> Close
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <EricaTheStrange> !squee
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry so after you take off armor he always does one wide swing
[05/22/19, 11:35:24 AM] <MatthewOry> in da nuts
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <dayntee> You did totally nail him in the groin though...
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <The_TBoyce> Yay for glitches! :D
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <MatthewOry> Im dying
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Glitches that help you win @The_TBoyce

[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <MatthewOry> rocks magically appear
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <EricaTheStrange> People ants their child murdered to have previous experience @darkofnate
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <MatthewOry> swing now
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <chaoticloony> Rock his world, Trisha!
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <The_TBoyce> The game where rocks can literally be the difference between life and death.
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <EricaTheStrange> want @darkofnate
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <MatthewOry> @GeekandSundry always have your sling going before he turns to you lol

[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <MatthewOry> gotta get used to having sling out most of the time
[05/22/19, 11:35:25 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> I think this will be the run.

[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <dayntee> Man, I hate to see what the later ones look like
[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <darkofnate> @EricaTheStrange Hugo knows it's important for you to do it yourself. He doesn't want to steal your thunder.
[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <chaoticloony> Be the BOSS, Trisha!
[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <dayntee> Hugo is basically an escort quest - just there to frustrate you

[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <BeardtasticYogi> How is that an incentive to win?
[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <The_TBoyce> Dodge is your new friend!
[05/22/19, 11:35:26 AM] <darkofnate> Apparently Trisha strongly associates profanity with monkeys.
