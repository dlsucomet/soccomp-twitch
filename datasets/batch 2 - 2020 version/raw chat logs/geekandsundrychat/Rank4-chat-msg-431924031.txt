[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Forestsix> Shadow drop!!!
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> Death Standing yesterday preview on twitch atpHorns calebK klinkSmile doodGood
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Ossborn> Unfortunatelly, that game is released in episodes afaik... I will have to wait until all are released
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> Stranding I meant atpRtsd2
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Jmarkwith> I"m complete opposite and need the Avengers game more than I thought I would
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Ossborn> That´s my point, I do not want to wait for the next episode, I want to play the full game ^^
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Mah_alleinir> gandsNopeNopeNope
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Jmarkwith> Avengers and Ultimate Alliance 3 coming out soon too will be great
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Eristocracy> Opinion: Releasing FFVII episodically aligns more with the demographic most excited and able to afford the title, but have stopped playing JRPGs because they feel they can't commit time to a 200 hour title.
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Ossborn> FF7... Ganz oder gar nicht... all or nothing ... but I´m old school ^^
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <EricaTheStrange> I want to play the remake but I know the story will be exactly the same as the original and that is what imo is the worst part of the game.
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Eristocracy> Spread that 200 hours over several episodes and you have a string of shorter games that fit the available playtimes of older gamers.
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <EricaTheStrange> You need more than 200 for ff7, i spent about 1000 hours playing the original @Eristocracy
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <thekaddis> is this just talking about ff7?
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <EricaTheStrange> The thing at the end of the first disc?
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <thekaddis> or they actually going to play
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <fondestgreetings> fondestgreetings subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[05/30/19, 1:35:23 PM] <Eristocracy> @EricaTheStrange I think my longest playthrough was 210 hours, but I am not a stat min-maxer.
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Ossborn> @EricaTheStrange Yeah... after all those years I still feel like I still have an open bill with Spehiroth... seeing that scene again may be emotionally stressful
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <doinger55> @thekaddis patience you must have young padawan. (I think the will start to play any moment)
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> I have beaten 1 through 10 - 2
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> FF8!!!
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <EricaTheStrange> I love 8, Jess has amazing taste
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <GreenThingLP> I've finished 1, 4, 7, and Tactics. Got close to the end of 5 & 8 but quit for some reason.
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <tenostark> #unpopularopinion lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Eristocracy> IX > VII > VII
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Mackles> 8 is dope. X is my fav tho. Love me some Auron.
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Eristocracy> ^^ in my opinion.
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> Time to drawl magic for hours and hours
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Sephiroth sealed his own fate when he did that @Ossborn
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> oh beat 12 too
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Katsutomai> Yuna, Tidus and whatnot
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Lightning was 13 and 13 3
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Katsutomai> 13 is Lightning, Snow etcetc
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Katsutomai> 12 is Fran, Basche, Penelo
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Katsutomai> Vieras
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Mackles> 12 is where the combat is live as you run around
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <Eristocracy> My biggest gripe about VIII: I have to equip an extradimensional creature in order to sip a bloody potion.
[05/30/19, 1:35:24 PM] <EricaTheStrange> The combat system for 12 put me off playing the game
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> 9 is the best then 6 then 8 then 10 then 7 then 5
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Jmarkwith> Best Final Fantasy game is Kingdom Hearts 2
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Katsutomai> Yea starting at 12 I started disliking the way they were taking the Combat system. =/
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <FelixJongleur> 9 and 7 are the top
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <EricaTheStrange> 6,8 and 13 are imo the best FF games ever
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Katsutomai> I loved 10's leveling system
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Eristocracy> Loved the gambits that let me toss my party in a certain dungeon, overheat my PS2 for a couple of days, and come back max level.
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Mackles> ^^ YES. The Sphere Grid is the greatest leveling system of all time.
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Kings glaive
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> I love not using 10 leveling system the most in 10 haha
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <aurice_heartly> you know how you can tell who the hardcore final fantasy fans are? is when they say FF6 is the best FF story
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <EricaTheStrange> It's one of the best @aurice_heartly
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> love ff7
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Eristocracy> FF6 has my second favorite story, but 9 made me cry.
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <FelixJongleur> Trying make your previous statement of 6 being the best?
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <FelixJongleur> thats a hard sell Aurice
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <elproxy> 13 is the best one, fight me
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> k
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Andyinsomnia> jcvimHi Jess, Nate and chat
[05/30/19, 1:35:25 PM] <Eristocracy> @elproxy I'd prefer to just amicably disagree with you.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Katsutomai> God these FMV's were amazing back in the day. I loved them.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <aurice_heartly> FF6 is the absolute best... but im 36 and i played them from the start
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Ossborn> thuluHEY Andyinsomnia
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <aurice_heartly> i experienced FF6 as in FFIII American
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> 1,6 and 7 are the best
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Andyinsomnia> 13 is a solid game, I like 13-2 more tho
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Mackles> critroleBidet
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <blockman73> hey Jess hows the crow friending going ?
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <FelixJongleur> I've played them all as well but I don't share your opinion that 6 is the best.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <aurice_heartly> if you are new to the FF series and play FF6 now... they wouldnt understand how FF6 revolutionized story telling
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <ArisBranwin> Everyone suffers from Popeye-ism.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> best final boos battles i think 9 takes it. the song dark messenger that plays during the trance Kuja battle is the best
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <EricaTheStrange> I got stuck half way though 13_2 when i ran out of keys @Andyinsomnia
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Shinji257> That moment in my teenage days when I found out FF3 was actually FF6 and that 2, 3, and 5 were completely skipped over.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Katsutomai> I absolutely adored the Esper system in FFVI
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Jmarkwith> I'm a bigger fan of FF2. Thought the characters were really fleshed out and just a compelling story over all
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <ArisBranwin> But I can't wait to see the new version when it FINALLY comes out before the year 3000.
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <Andyinsomnia> I'd say 8, 15, 10, 13-2, 13 is my top 5 ff games
[05/30/19, 1:35:26 PM] <EricaTheStrange> What about eyes on me? @Hipnopotamussus
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> 8 was a good game but I didn't like squall
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <aurice_heartly> 3 reasons why FF6 is the best. #1: most playable characters in any FF .... #2: has the most summon creatures in any FF ... #3: OPERA
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> this version on the switch is slower than on console and PC Jessica FYI @GeekandSundry
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Shinji257> I wonder what this game would have looked like if it was done on the SNES...
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Katsutomai> Crisis Core
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> great too @ EricaTheStrange
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <ArisBranwin> Dirge of Cerberus.
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <FelixJongleur> I disliked 8s start and the mechanics of the game were poor seeing as you could be the game without leveling once.
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Kshizz> dirge of cerbrus
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <ArisBranwin> Vincent Valentine.
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> ^
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Andyinsomnia> Squall was the best angsty but secretly soft boi
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <aurice_heartly> Dirge of Cerberus
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <aurice_heartly> for ps2
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <EricaTheStrange> 15 is just to broey for me and i just couldn't get into the game, there was nothing about the game that said you must play this game
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Katsutomai> Oh, crap, right Crisis Core was the one with Zack
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <ArisBranwin> FFVII: Dirge of Cerberus. It was Vincent and all his coolness.. for what it was.
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> Mist
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <aurice_heartly> Zack lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <Kshizz> Greg
[05/30/19, 1:35:27 PM] <EricaTheStrange> BComp!
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <aurice_heartly> Bob
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> Jason
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Shinji257> No. Not Zack.
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Jmarkwith> Spike McSpikerson
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Zismarith> Oh, I thought this was on later. Hi though gandsGoo
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <SBX611> @Shinji257 - Probably like Crystalis. Anyone remember that game?!
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <epic_pants_> DansGame
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Shinji257> Never heard of it...
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <aurice_heartly> should have named him "1st Class Soldier" tbh lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Andyinsomnia> 15 is certainly bro-ish but in like a good way . just a nice BROad trip
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> I owned this game on PC, PS4 and the switch and yeah this is the slower version Jess @GeekandSundry atpCap calebHa
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <ArisBranwin> And now you crashed it.
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Shinji257> No!!!!!
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <opshlds> Yeah Jess! Awesome game, sorry it froze though...
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <blockman73> them frozen boogers
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> I use to have trouble with everyone's name in these games because I always changed the names lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <aurice_heartly> this is why you dont name him Boogers
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <Zismarith> There are at least 20 instances in this game where Cloud should've killed someone with his hair.
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <shawzee12> I love how Barrett gave verbal direction on how to use the directional pad
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <ArisBranwin> At least the music works.
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <opshlds> Oh, I see the problem... Switch. ;)
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <aurice_heartly> try going back to to the home screen
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <aurice_heartly> and coming back to the game
[05/30/19, 1:35:28 PM] <tenostark> well that was a good game folks =P
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Koshirro> those hard ass edges are just too heavy to render
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <tenostark> much frozen, such wow
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> start over
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Shinji257> Play it on PC
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <doinger55> Play Skyrim
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <blockman73> backup plan--talk about your crow friend
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <ArisBranwin> "Jess plays "It's Frozen."
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <oRionRogue> oh man I miss this game...
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <EricaTheStrange> How about a Jess Q&A if it freezes again?
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> aurGG atpRtsd2
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <tenostark> @Koshirro and they are sharp
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Andyinsomnia> We can just speculate on WTF death stranding is about and what the avengers game is gona be like. both those topics can kill 3 hours easily
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <tenostark> @GeekandSundry You might be sick Jess, but your outfit is on point! =D
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Hipnopotamussus> my switch has never frozen in any game
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <opshlds> Grew up in love with this game. I've played through it probably 40 some times throughout the years. Definitely looking forward to the remake.
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <blockman73> true tenostark
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <EricaTheStrange> It always is @tenostark
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> I hope they keep the remake turn based
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> Bada Bing Bada Boom...…..
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <tenostark> @EricaTheStrange yup =D
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Andyinsomnia> skelly Dan and Kyle all played last week
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <oRionRogue> Wait, is that the same Nate from "Because Science" with Kyle Hill and his fantastic hair??
[05/30/19, 1:35:29 PM] <Shinji257> @FridayThe13thJasonX Hate to say it but it won't be. The demo already shows that it is real time like FF15 and FF Type-0
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <Zismarith> If Jess is ill, it just means she's awake.
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <RenegadeMacNCheese> more than likely, it's gonna be like ffxv
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <aurice_heartly> @FridayThe13thJasonX hopefully they keep the crossdressing cloud in the game lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <opshlds> @FridayThe13thJasonX or at leas the option to keep it turn based, but from what I gathered it's going to be active battle
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <Danoba> @oRionRogue Why yes it is.
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <tenostark> @Danoba good day good sir
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <tenostark> @Danoba I am making Altered Carbon guns today
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <oRionRogue> I thought I recognized that rich background voice
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <Danoba> @tenostark Thanks and to you as well. And that sounds like a fun project.
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <opshlds> @aurice_heartly That'll be awesome in HD ;)
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Ah Mario party, I thought he said murder party on jackbox :D
[05/30/19, 1:35:30 PM] <blockman73> darker or blond again ?

[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <tenostark> @Danoba uh that was weird I just went to send you a message and it went back to the beginning of us meeting on twitch o_O too much scrolling
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <oRionRogue> nostalgia increases!
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <tenostark> @EricaTheStrange in the best ways possible =P
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <aurice_heartly> free potions from bodies if you want them
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <Danoba> @tenostark Yeah, same, messages are probably bugged, the latest one shows up but pushes me back to the top.
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <ArisBranwin> I'm kinda waiting on a FFVIII remake.. or them at least getting Squalls leather jacket.
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Square will never give us what we want, we are likely to get Kingdom Hearts 4 before we get FF8 on PS4 or even a remake of it
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> dragon quest 11 was an amazing resent turn based game
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> FF8 Remake? calebGasm klinkSmile doodAnime
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <aurice_heartly> cross them fingers... dont want the spell Freeze cast on the game
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <tenostark> @Danoba nice trip down memory lane =P
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <Koshirro> that's actually a pretty cool theory
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> Freeze! Kappa
[05/30/19, 1:35:31 PM] <Danoba> @tenostark Indeed, indeed.
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <aurice_heartly> Squall died by the Sorceress at the end of Disk 1
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <ArisBranwin> That was one of the many game theories.
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <EricaTheStrange> That's a theory @aurice_heartly
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <aurice_heartly> yeah i know lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <Ironspore> Pineapples!!
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <ArisBranwin> And this is where we get Xenogears..
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <aurice_heartly> another theory.... squall didnt die by the sorceress but got seriously brain damaged and dreamed everything else
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Laguna is Squalls dad @GeekandSundry
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <NaSh_kRaP> No Freeze! atpRtsd1
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <Zismarith> If this is a direct port of the original, it could still freeze at any moment. I have 3 memory cards full of FF7 saves because of that.
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <aurice_heartly> FUN FACT: all of FF8 characters are based and created to look like Real Life Actors/Actresses
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <ArisBranwin> Don't worry Jess.. I'll help you lvl in XIV..
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <aurice_heartly> I.E. Headmaster Cid is Robin Williams
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <EricaTheStrange> he got slashed across the face with a sword so he can survive getting impaled with an ice spear @aurice_heartly
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <blockman73> goiter Jess
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <Ossborn> Just don´t make a show for the Online Final Fantasy game and then schedule it for the day when they regularly do maintenance... Crowd Control, anyone? :-D
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <EricaTheStrange> In FF8 that was the first time i saw the word Selfie or maybe I am just sheltered lol :D
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <Andyinsomnia> WAOW Jess, don't mock Nate for being a disembodied voice
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> one thing you have to say is the cg from 8 held up so much better then 8 lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:32 PM] <tenostark> @GeekandSundry Hey Jess, how's your new Crow friend?! =D
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <FridayThe13thJasonX> 7
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <EricaTheStrange> She would only mock him if she invited him to go dancing and he said he couldn't go because he has no body to dance with @Andyinsomnia
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <Andyinsomnia> !points Erica
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, Erica! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 28 points!
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <aurice_heartly> @FridayThe13thJasonX also it was very easy back in the day to make AMVs from the game cuz when you put the FF8 disks into a pc... you could rip out the CGI videos and save them
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <tenostark> Did you guys know about Jess' crow befriending adventure? lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <Andyinsomnia> resub gandsHype
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Yes, I've seen the instagram videos and she talked about it on Bizzare States @tenostark
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <aurice_heartly> RIP speed run, Jess
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <ArisBranwin> One day Jess should do Fatal Frame.. because why not..
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <tenostark> Crows talk sh*t lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <Andyinsomnia> Is santa just a murder of crows in a red suit?
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <aurice_heartly> talk to the girl named Jessie
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <Antretha> IF your watching, go talk to the button person
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <ArisBranwin> You row changed him which changes his dmg.
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <aurice_heartly> Jessie is the NICEST person in this whole game towards Cloud
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <EricaTheStrange> #mydepthpersception the new album by my chemical romance
[05/30/19, 1:35:33 PM] <EricaTheStrange> I can't remember who jessie is in this game
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <aurice_heartly> the girl from Avalanche @EricaTheStrange
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <aurice_heartly> in the remake trailer she is the girl with the ponytail
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <blockman73> *button*
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Andyinsomnia> The avengers game that was announced today is what I really want to see at E3
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Andyinsomnia> Square Enix with that and the FF7 remake are going to win this I think
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Andyinsomnia> *this year
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <EricaTheStrange> I hope there is a Dragon Age 4 announcement as well as Dragon Age 1 and 2 and the Mass Effect trilogy being announced for PS4 :D
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <aurice_heartly> alot of ppl arent happy about Sony not having a press conference... IMO E3 isnt about the press conferences its about the game trailers and the other companies still gonna show playstation game trailers nonetheless
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <ArisBranwin> I'd love more DA... one can hope Bioware will come through.
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Andyinsomnia> I want more dragon age but I want Bioware to stop with the crunch culture more
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <tenostark> ready to blow your moms mind eh? haah
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <EricaTheStrange> The PS5 will come out before DA4 does @ArisBranwin
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <blockman73> are you covering it for Nerdist ?
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Jmarkwith> @Nerdist what do you think has changed more. Comic Con or E3?
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <ArisBranwin> The Xbox2 will come out before then at this point.
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <aurice_heartly> @Jmarkwith depends... you mean SDCC?
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Ossborn> Last thing I heard about Dragon Age was "Anthem with Dragons"... Please, don´t!
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Andyinsomnia> 2021 is probably a good guess for DA4, around a year into next gen
[05/30/19, 1:35:34 PM] <Jmarkwith> yeah SDCC

[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> @Jmarkwith then i say SDCC... its always changing every year...
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <ArisBranwin> I wanted that Fable group RPG that was supposed to come out with the XboX One
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <guy_whos_drunk_716> i need a bowser's backyard update. need a fable or wild arms!
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> however this year's SDCC gonna be awesome cuz Spider Man Far From Home is gonna come out about 2 weeks before SDCC
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <Ossborn> I wished there was another game beased on the FGables comic books... sadly, The Wolf Among Us was a Telltale title
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <Andyinsomnia> The fable studio was closed down right? I think it is so unique that it would be hard for a new studio to capture fables feel
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> they announced that they will be talking about Phase 4 marvel in SDCC 2019
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <blockman73> cant wait for Bowsers movie !
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <Antretha> Can we get a real life comment from Jess about Bowsers movie?
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <Antretha> Since we don't have #bizzarrestates
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> Jess is completely right and what year did it change you dare ask???? Year 2005
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <blockman73> missing BS like crazy
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <ArisBranwin> Just come to New Orleans Comic Con.. then I can show you around.. show you some haunted stuff... show you Marie LaVeau and Voodoo Queen stuff.. and then Raising Canes..
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> thats when tv shows started coming out and changing the whole seen
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> I.E. HEROES
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> scene*
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <FelixJongleur> E3 has always been a marketing event and not so much intended for general public :P
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <Jmarkwith> Also do you think the game companies doing more youtube direct videos like Nintendo has been what's effecting E3 as a whole?
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> Nintendo will be showcasing basically Pokemon Sword/Shield & Zelda: Link's Awakening
[05/30/19, 1:35:35 PM] <aurice_heartly> thats all they really have to show to win
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Andyinsomnia> I certainly think studios have realised they can do their own thing on twitch and get way more attention than they would at E3 where they are 1 of 100
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <ShadracMould> been thinking of replaying this game on my psone classic
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Nemisar> Yeah lots of news coming out these days about the newer games, ahead of E3
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Andyinsomnia> Bloodlines 2 announcement was a major thing for several days which in modern internet terms is decades. at E3 it would have barely been heard about
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <aurice_heartly> btw Sony is having a press conference just not at E3... they will be having it on their own at a later time
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Zismarith> A lot of it is an announcement to have an announcement. Gameplay trailer or nothing, thanks.
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Antretha> Remember Machine type is weak vs electric
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <MarcOfTheCovenant> God damn. Hearing the music brings back all the nostalgia!
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <EricaTheStrange> Red 13 has the saddest story i think but I don't think Jess will get that far
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <ExpijPL> Yeah I remember I died on that fight :P
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Antretha> Not today
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <aurice_heartly> @EricaTheStrange use Nanaki :) also he has the best future though
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <aurice_heartly> i refuse to call Nanaki by that other name for its a slave name
[05/30/19, 1:35:36 PM] <Marb_04> started early today?

[05/30/19, 1:35:44 PM] <ArisBranwin> Nope.. cuz sending anyone Cain means he'd eat someone.

[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <aurice_heartly> you need an Anit Freeze Materia
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <starphaser> dont worry the remake will fix this by having it broken up into 4 games but with 10x the freezing xD
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> mabye Alice is jelous and wants to play
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <Marb_04> it is way too quiet without the alarm noise
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <CrimVZ> I think they playing the PC version of FF7 lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <aurice_heartly> @GeekandSundry Jess you should act like your frozen too when it freezes lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <Ossborn> casts Fireball to unfreeze the stream.
[05/30/19, 1:35:45 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> We are with you.

[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> how to disable freezing
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> maybe the real moral is Ecoterrorism isn't all its cracked u to be?
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Blow the dust off? That’s how we did it back in the day
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <iwishiwasblank> Hey Siri...
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> the no encounters is from the PC version
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> they didnt know about the freezing issue til the game was released to switch
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <Kainless> put the game to normal speed during the cutscenes
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <CrimVZ> I had FF7 on pc and it kept freezing
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> you are making better time lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> @GeekandSundry just a heads up dont speed up game
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <paper__crane> Oh yeah, normal speed!
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <blockman73> Jessie freeze !!!!!
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> thats why its freezing
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <Koshirro> remember the cartridge tilt glitch? that spawned the "geddan" meme?
[05/30/19, 1:35:46 PM] <aurice_heartly> normal speed it so it doesnt freeze

[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <aurice_heartly> this is the true endgame... not freezing
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <Bigdizz87> they did a better job porting it to iOS but its odd to play
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <iwishiwasblank> Definitely a KOTR counter happening right now...
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <iwishiwasblank> Don’t let her get to 10
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <CrimVZ> Maybe a hardwear issue and less soft wear. I own a copy of FF7 on switch and am on the start of disk 2 and haven’t had any issues
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <aurice_heartly> always save the game every 5 minutes monkaS
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <aurice_heartly> dont be mean to Jessie... she has the power to freeze this game lol
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> meanwhile... there is footage of Crash Bandicoot sneaking into and out of a covert videogame development complex somewhere out there
[05/30/19, 1:35:47 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Maybe have an episode where Jess destroys the switch with Clouds sword? Or not. I’m just brainstorming ideas.

[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <aurice_heartly> one more FMV to hurdle
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <iwishiwasblank> In my experience PC version crashed due to all of the video rendering and technology of the time.
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <iwishiwasblank> Since fan updates/mods it’s gotten better.
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> maybe we will get a Labo upgrade that prevents crashes?

[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> imagine how fast the save battery would get drained with auto save tho
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <Andyinsomnia> In my day we saved our game on a bit of plastic that was crazy expensive and could only save 15 games Max
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <aurice_heartly> you dont need the flower for anything lol its not FF Tactics
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <HandiGamerShow> Just a crazy idea right off the top of my head: If switch version is broken, play it on like literally any other system? its incredibly accessible on a ton of systems where it doesnt freeze
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <ghosthack159> oooh......
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <blockman73> F this game LOOOOOL
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <doinger55> floppy disks is where it's at 1.44Mb

[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <Andyinsomnia> FFreeze count: 5
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <ghosthack159> this feels like a crash
[05/30/19, 1:35:48 PM] <Koshirro> this game needs more frames...
[05/30/19, 1:35:49 PM] <aurice_heartly> just let it play out
[05/30/19, 1:35:49 PM] <blockman73> just breath Jess

[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <blockman73> someone start a timer
[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <doinger55> an Acai bowl
[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> even the game needs to get the jump on its train of thought
[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <HandiGamerShow> or, umm.. just play on another system? This game is Everywhere. why play the only buggy version?
[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <Andyinsomnia> The speed the train is going this game is clearly set in Northern England
[05/30/19, 1:35:50 PM] <ghosthack159> .....at least the music is super tense and riviting
