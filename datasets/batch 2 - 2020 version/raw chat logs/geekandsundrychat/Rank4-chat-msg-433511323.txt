[06/3/19, 12:11:35 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @phoenixgoth it's really good but just WOW not a happy game
[06/3/19, 12:11:55 AM] <phoenixgoth> @DarkestArgentum I saw Ivan GMing, that pretty much guarantees pain and heartbreak
[06/3/19, 12:11:57 AM] <xezzerbrande> this is great! what a nice surprise there'd be this "intro to the marathon" chat :D
[06/3/19, 12:11:59 AM] <DriveFrew> I'm getting ready to watch the VOD right now, wasn't able to watch it all yesterday!

[06/3/19, 12:12:36 AM] <The_TBoyce> Having been to multiple antique/thrift shops, the Relics & Rarities set is so spot-on.
[06/3/19, 12:12:45 AM] <denisepantoja> @xezzerbrande lots of new interviews!!
[06/3/19, 12:12:46 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @denisepantoja oh no don't misunderstand it was great but just....i can NEVER play that game
[06/3/19, 12:12:48 AM] <phoenixgoth> @annabelhei Yes, that's correct!
[06/3/19, 12:13:00 AM] <annabelhei> cool, thank you!!
[06/3/19, 12:13:10 AM] <denisepantoja> Haha @the_tboyce I did a lot of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù!
[06/3/19, 12:13:21 AM] <DriveFrew> @Kevin_Kelly Got me dead to rights : )
[06/3/19, 12:13:21 AM] <zokrinpb> When does R&R come back? Can't find any info on it
[06/3/19, 12:13:32 AM] <phoenixgoth> @denisepantoja Will there be VOD of the interviews? I have to get on a plane in a bit and I don't wanna miss the interviews!
[06/3/19, 12:13:38 AM] <DarkestArgentum> @phoenixgoth i DID come up with an interestign idea for a horror rpg mechanic where you color the tips of some chopsticks diffrent colors and "make a pull" dependign on the color determines what happenes
[06/3/19, 12:13:52 AM] <Nemisar> Remember, the Ten Candles is part of the long ITTD video in our Past Broadcasts, as each thing haven't been split out yet :)
[06/3/19, 12:13:55 AM] <phoenixgoth> @DarkestArgentum that sounds Terrifying.
[06/3/19, 12:14:01 AM] <denisepantoja> Haha @darkestargentum it was so VERY unexpected for us. What happened was idk, just whew.
