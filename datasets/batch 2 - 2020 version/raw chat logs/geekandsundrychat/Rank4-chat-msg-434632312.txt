[06/5/19, 10:02:35 AM] <Buzzclickz> Why be afraid of situations you may never be in? @Erika @Khail
[06/5/19, 10:02:35 AM] <super390> Doesn't have a problem with the insane or posse part.

[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <chaoticloony> I am so enjoying this conversation!
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Ossborn> Did Erika recently throw any controllers? If yes, then Khail may need one of those protective helmets that boxers wear in the ring...
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Paladin356> i hope this comment gets read
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Erika really wants to see the new IT
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <shidareAKI> looking into dark mirrors has always freaked me the fuck out
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Paladin356> so, i knew someone in college who was literally afraid of Parmesean Cheese
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Paladin356> it was...bizarre!
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <majormadz> What did I join to?

[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Nightbot> Keep your hand on the volume button because Erika and Khail go even deeper on the newly released, first-person psychological horror game ‚ÄúLayers of Fear 2‚Äù from Bloober Team ( twitter.com/BlooberTeam ), and Gun ( twitter.com/FearTheGun ).
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Paladin356> Buzzclickz i believe so
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <super390> I now want to dare her to watch the Whizzo The Clown film, which is 90 excruciating minutes of "children's movie" made of some drunken tv host in the '60s when everyone loved clowns.
[06/5/19, 10:02:36 AM] <Shadowner> the game is deeply complex

[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <Paladin356> honestly, i can't remember if Erika even has a tattoo
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <Shadowner> golden snitch is popular
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <cinphoria> Man, I remember looking in our white pages when I was like, 12, and finding a "J. and L. Potter" in it, and shaking with excitement and wanting to call the number for several years
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <maineogre> Erika can't admit to having a dark mark to stay out of Azkaban
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <laurencupp> Thank you Khail for that good meme
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <Paladin356> oh Erika, idk if its been mentioned or not, but will you be going to GenCon again this year?
[06/5/19, 10:02:44 AM] <Hwaigrl666> Anyone heard anything about the AR Harry Potter game coming out from Niantic?

[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <Hwaigrl666> I wanna say it‚Äôll be released in the fall, but that‚Äôs just a guess.
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <cinphoria> RIP Alpha Parties
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <chaoticloony> You used your Teleport Item mutation to get it!
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <Paladin356> I got to meet Erika there last year...and thankfully our energy didn't cause an implosion
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <Danoba> I mean, the Narwhal did see a lot so I don't blame them for wanting to step out today.
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <JeffM0307> That sounds wild to me :D
[06/5/19, 10:02:45 AM] <Paladin356> @shidareAKI i'll have to make sure that I say hi to you

[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <shidareAKI> Khail is trying to summon Sax by admitting to crimes
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <jesusspicy> Erika have you seen the musical Something Rotten?
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <Shadowner> 2b:-2b

[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <Hwaigrl666> I‚Äôve obviously been understanding Shakespeare wrong :D
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <cinphoria> I saw Twelfth Night in the cemetery last year and it's pretty amazing. i had such a huge crush on everybody in the cast
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Erika = Geneva Wargames Convention, later known as the Gen Con gaming convention.
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <maineogre> no that is twelfth night
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <owifig> No, it's 12th Night - Orsino being emo
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <shidareAKI> Shakespeare has some great non sequitur one liners
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <Shadowner> that may be new game plus collectibles
[06/5/19, 10:02:46 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Khail could admit to a fashion crime, i am sure that will have the same effect and Sax will appear

[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <Paladin356> @shidareAKI well, i definitely hope that our paths cross. Too bad theres no G&S/Alpha Party meetup this year
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <cinphoria> @FuffyButt amazing
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <Paladin356> maybe we can arrange a G&S meetup
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <shidareAKI> The musical that I most regretting not being able to get to NYC fast enough to see was Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <shidareAKI> @Paladin356 maybe the fans should arrange their own meetup? JS...
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <laurencupp> I need to go to NY just to see Hadestown. MAAAAAN......

[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <jesusspicy> It‚Äôs about two struggling playwrighter brothers during Shakespeare times and the older brother hates/envy‚Äôs Shakespeare and goes to a witch with the desire to know what Shakespeare next musical so he could write it
[06/5/19, 10:02:47 AM] <cinphoria> the Shakespeare in the cemetery people are doing Romeo & Juliet this fall and I look forward to heckling it

[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <laurencupp> Now Im thinking about the vine with a kid running outside with a knife
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <maineogre> one of my favorite lines in twelfth night is Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <EricaTheStrange> HI @Paladin356
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <laurencupp> "what do you have?" "A KNIFE"
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <cinphoria> @laurencupp that's exactly where my mind went to xD
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <shidareAKI> Erika is the living embodiment of "Thanks, I hate it."
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <Hwaigrl666> Damn you Casio Pauhana!!! peachyFire
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <laurencupp> @cinphoria :D
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <cinphoria> @shidareAKI but she's the living embodiment of "A KNIFE!"
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Is Erika getting all the spoops out for when she streams this with Blondie?
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Well me and Erika have something in common, but I had my swiss army knife because I used the magnifying glass to take tests & textbooks & things,
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <FuffyButt> so this is the Bambi sequel
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <desertshaddow> Leatherman knives were not a problem in my high school, but then i went to high school in hick town arizona.
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <laurencupp> My grandfather gave me a hunting knife when I was FAR TOO YOUNG so I just hid it amongst my shelf of stuffed animals
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <shidareAKI> "I'm scared" and ASMR special with Erika Ishii
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <Shadowner> you got a leg to stand on
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <Hwaigrl666> Why there was no one behind Erika to scare her during that video is beyond me
[06/5/19, 10:02:48 AM] <FuffyButt> Why was there a deer on this boat

[06/5/19, 10:02:51 AM] <shidareAKI> don't be afraid of seasoning, especially salt
[06/5/19, 10:02:51 AM] <bnailo> buy groceries in bulk from discount stores. It is cheaper and you can meal prep for a week plus

[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <MrNY2Cali> @shidareAKI and always taste test while cooking
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <Zaecus> Don't let anyone sneak up behind you during a scary game.
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <shidareAKI> Yes, don't be afraid to taste your food while you cook
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <chaoticloony> Great timing, Erika!
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Sax won't sneak up behind Erika, no chance of that happening ;)
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <shidareAKI> OH never prepare chicken (or any raw meat for that matter) on wooden cutting boards
[06/5/19, 10:02:52 AM] <Shadowner> Sax can already scare erika

[06/5/19, 10:02:53 AM] <shidareAKI> boats are smaller than ships
[06/5/19, 10:02:53 AM] <Shadowner> a boat can be held on a ship
[06/5/19, 10:02:53 AM] <LightsHamer> size i think
[06/5/19, 10:02:53 AM] <MrNY2Cali> it goes by the weight of the vessel

[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <Fluffy_Snowfall> You always should be able to pet the puppy
[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <shidareAKI> there's a whole twitter dedicated to whether or not your can pet the puppy in games
[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Puppies are trustworthy
[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <EricaTheStrange> Can you pet a puppy, but will the puppy pet you back?
[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <MrNY2Cali> It would be a resdient evil Bolton puppy
[06/5/19, 10:02:59 AM] <Zaecus> You can always pet the puppy.

[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <Zaecus> Sometimes, you can only pet the puppy once.

[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <Shadowner> up there
[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <maineogre> It would be interesting to see Erika go through the Haunted Mansion at Disney and see how the kids react to her
[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <darkofnate> "I'm just sittin' here watching the wheels go round and round..."
[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <Shadowner> james thought he saw a holy grail, but it was just a bottle of booze
[06/5/19, 10:03:00 AM] <chaoticloony> Today on Mannequin Madness, watch Khail and Erika stride through a set on a ship!

[06/5/19, 10:03:01 AM] <steelneko> @MrNY2Cali That's true. The original sheet music at least should be clear, if not the recording from the Looney Toons short.

[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Shadowner> terror decompression
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> it's usually bdsm specific
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Jimersion> Whip whip cream and chocolate sprinkles.
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Zismarith> I'd recommend playing a video game, but . . .
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Khail needs a dose of Ivan and what true aftercare needs are
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> but it can also be after traumatic events
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <darkofnate> @Zismarith LOL
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> bdsm culture also requires aftercase
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehhehehhehehehhehehe
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> aftercare

[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <bnailo> aftercare is like cool down stretching after a workout
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <bnailo> it is lol
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Jimersion> Tequila.
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Zaecus> NO, it's what comes after the things people think are BDSM
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <Shadowner> often with someone you trust
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> It's a facet of bdsm after running scenarios
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <darkofnate> I honestly didn't know it came from BDSM, I usually hear it in reference to RPGs...
[06/5/19, 10:03:02 AM] <shidareAKI> it helps build trust and encourages communication between partners
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <MrNY2Cali> Aftercare is just mental health wellness
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <steelneko> Did Dread have aftercare sessions? the show was so intense to watch.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <shidareAKI> but it's been adopted into other things because people figured out it had other psychological applications
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Zaecus> Cuddle Puddle!
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <shidareAKI> taking care of yourself when you've been in a stressful situation
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <bnailo> it is from bdsm. it also ensures that everyone involved is coping well post whatever scenario. y'all have got this!
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <darkofnate> I wasn't specific, but you would probably need aftercare when confronting rocket-propelled grenades as well.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Zaecus> See, the spooks just want a cuddle puddle.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <EL5EWHILE> !lof2
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Nightbot> Layers of Fear 2: COME ON!.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Shadowner> almost made it
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <FuffyButt> is it like watching a kids movie after a horror movie
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <shidareAKI> In any case, Erika, you should have SUSHI that is superior aftercare
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <CinderFlame> That was quick
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <EL5EWHILE> !lof2
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Nightbot> Layers of Fear 2: WHAT WAS THAT?!.

[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Nightbot> Layers of Fear 2: WHAT WAS THAT?!.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <steelneko> Vampire: The Masquerade sessions can get real intense.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <chaoticloony> Like after playing in a 10 Candles game
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <darkofnate> @shidareAKI What if you had a traumatic event involving zombie fish? The sushi might not be helpful.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôd need aftercare after karaoke.
[06/5/19, 10:03:03 AM] <MrNY2Cali> jeez @shidareAKI now I want some KBBQ and Sushi

[06/5/19, 10:03:04 AM] <shidareAKI> @darkofnate obviously a case by case scenario
[06/5/19, 10:03:04 AM] <gnu_user> i mean both communities like to invest in role play, so...
[06/5/19, 10:03:04 AM] <darkofnate> Fair enough
[06/5/19, 10:03:04 AM] <shidareAKI> @MrNY2Cali don't even talk to me, I want all the asian food right now
