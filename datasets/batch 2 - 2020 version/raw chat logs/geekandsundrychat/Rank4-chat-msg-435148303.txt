[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Geekouts> Sweet Jess Plays is running the Dan Casey mod! Hi all! Hope you all are having a good day
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> Oh... I obviously havnt played it long enough to completely miss the release of a new hero...
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> When I still played it, I wasmostly D´Va and Sombra... got sick of loot boxes at some point and stoppped
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <LF1052> Sombra, Ana, zaera lol
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Nemisar> I do not play enough to have a main :P
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <LF1052> Ya I’m bad at spelling cryCry
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> what's up party people. hows your day going?
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> What's everyone's favorite character?
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> I based my Shadowrun Decker on Sombra... that should answer your question ^^
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> Speaking of E-sports stuff I no joke saw a youtube stream on a tournament for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Tournament Fighters
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <LF1052> I like to play sombra to shutdown ults lol
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> Same, Cyberpunk 2077, but I also hope for a Last Of Us 2 release date
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> ... But thats PS4, and Sony isnt at E3, iirc
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> I hope to see an update for Battle Toads
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Nemisar> of course also more about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 !
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> My favorite part of Overwatch are the animated vignettes they have to push the story and characters forward
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> Battletoads the arcade game was super stupid fun
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Ossborn> Borderland 3.... I am not good at 1sst person shooters on console, but given that it releases 6 months later on Steam, it looks like I have to get the PS4 version
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> There's a steam summer sale coming up soon too right?
[06/6/19, 1:41:48 PM] <Jmarkwith> That sounds like the card for a concert playing at the troubadour
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> ^the names of the other players
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Ossborn> SR points? deSeRteur?
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> Even wait a little longer than that for Borderlands 3 for the GOY or Gold edition
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> I'm playing through Far Cry 4 right now
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Ossborn> That would be an idea, but I love the Borderlands franchise, I just hate the timed exclusivity on Epic.... not sure if I want to wait that long :-P
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <D4mmitJoe> Is Wednesday Club still a thing?
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> Their vignettes are awesome and is pretty much the pitch for the show right there
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Ossborn> No, Wednesday stopped a while ago

[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Ossborn> I started reading "Naomi", as there was a Comixology sale for the first 3 issues recently.... not a big DC fan, but I thought: " A newly introduced hero? Why not, lets check her out..."
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> @Ossborn if you like Naomi check out Young Justice too. Same writer and some new characters
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <greg1756> I'm knee deep in the War of the Realms
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Ossborn> Ooooh... another #ItsNotACultist thuluNOTACULT thuluHEY
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Jmarkwith> Favorite marvel book right now for me is Fantastic Four. Just happy that they are back and the stories so far are fun
[06/6/19, 1:41:49 PM] <Geekouts> @ossborn what do you think about it?
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Ossborn> So far, I like it, I´m in issue 4 now
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> Ooof yeah. That's smart. War of the Realms is really issue 1 then anything is fair game

[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> that they did Geekouts
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> Dan... did you just admit to feeding???? HSWP
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Ossborn> But yeah, Right issues can be a headache... That´s why Scarlet Witch and QWuicksilver, although being part of the MCU never officially were called Mutants
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Geekouts> I would love to see a live action series about the Xavier academy on Disney's new platform. they could do some in depth character story telling over several episodes.
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> Confirmed Dan is GM tier player - signing LA Glads when?
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <leonmercury> Fantastic Four is owned by Fox, isn't it?
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Ossborn> Yeah, the F4 finally deserve a good movie
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> Yesss!!! I'd watch that interview
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <greg1756> I'm a Houston fan for my sins #AnteUp
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Ossborn> Not a movie, but I was hoping for a "Daughters Of The Dragon" Netflix show, after Misty and Colleen kind of teamed up in Iron Fist season 2... but that was right before the first cancellation announcement
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Geekouts> @ossborn yeah that would have been great
[06/6/19, 1:41:50 PM] <Geekouts> I know it's crazy but I hope Disney brings back some of the actors instead of recasting
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Ossborn> Yeah, but afaik there´s a barring clause of at least 2 years before Disney can do anything with those franchises
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <greg1756> xXx_-DanCasey-_xXx twitch stream incoming
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Ossborn> @Geekouts
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Geekouts> Yeah I figured those properties would be tied up in rights for a bit
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Ossborn> Oh and I also read that the Disney movies will return to Netflix at some point after Disney+ got started... in 2026
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Jmarkwith> Dan/Everyone, have you seen the new Batman vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie yet? Is it good?
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <ClientOW> hey Dan hows your day going?

[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <Jmarkwith> Favorite for me is the EVO Street Fighter stuff and least is LOL only really because I have no idea whats going on
[06/6/19, 1:41:51 PM] <greg1756> Favourite is Dota - least favourite is Madden.
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Sin_MeliodaS_> Ahahahaha
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Ossborn> Least favorite is League Of Legends.... Leastestestest is Fortnite

[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Geekouts> I have no idea what's happening in this game but it's fun watching it
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <greg1756> I went to ESL in Brooklyn last year. Dat shit was hyyype
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Geekouts> <-- mainly watches ttrpg streams
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Ossborn> Rocket League was fun.... I theink we even played a game against each other back when Nerdist still was streaming on Twitch on their own channel
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <greg1756> it was held in the Barclays Centre - they gave out free wristbands that flashed when the bomb was getting close to time
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Jmarkwith> Do you think there will be enough interest/content to have a traditional TV channel like an ESPN?
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Jmarkwith> ^^for E-Sports
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <greg1756> ESPN showed the Heroes of the Dorm and Disney XD and ESPN show OWL
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Jmarkwith> Would you subscribe to a multi e-sport streaming service?
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Ossborn> 2 or 3 years ago, I basically just watched traditional TV fore the Formula 1 races. Today, I only use my TV for the PS4, Blu Rays or Netflix.... 90% of my entertainment is Twitch
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <doinger55> Overwatch seems like total chaos to me. Maybe I'm not used to so many graphical effects.
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <derekleeketchum> I like you, Dan Casey. You's a smart cookie Kappa
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <greg1756> I saw on twitter somewhere that the total amount of hours for EVERY Doctor Who series combined is like under 400 hours.
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <doinger55> Can it be compared with Team Fortress 2, gameplay wise?
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <Nemisar> In some way, but you have more variety in characters and abilities
[06/6/19, 1:41:52 PM] <greg1756> *also increases damaged ;0
[06/6/19, 1:41:53 PM] <Jmarkwith> When I interned at G4 all we played was TF2 and peggle

[06/6/19, 1:41:53 PM] <Ossborn> 25(ish?) characters in Overwatch
[06/6/19, 1:41:53 PM] <greg1756> and counting Oss ;)

[06/6/19, 1:41:53 PM] <doinger55> I always wonderred if it worth more in such games to be defensive and survive longer. Or be more kind of berserker like and agressive and live with respawning often

[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> hahahaha yeah I've never managed to finish it.
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> tried twice
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <derekleeketchum> I liked Log Horizon better than SAO
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> Zarya gives me real Stella Von D vibes. She ain't takin' no one's crap!
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Ossborn> Not a big fan of Anime tv shows, but there are some movies I love to watch every once in a while... Princess Mononoke, Howls Moving Castle... basically anything Studio Ghibli
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> Who has been your favorite new character?
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> One Punch Man Season 1!!!
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> COWBOY BEEBOP -
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> My Hero Acadamia is great too.
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <derekleeketchum> I think I appreciated Log Horizon more than SAO because I related more to the real-life impactions of in-game mechanics since I play WoW
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Nemisar> I saw this the other day, a supposedly ultimate anime recommendation flowchart: https://i.redd.it/hod6fw8pp2231.jpg
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> I want Medabots reboot
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> Medabots was awesome. And some good new Digimon
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> https://nerdist.com/article/the-best-anime-for-beginners-to-watch/
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <derekleeketchum> like there's was a story arc about basically a child-slavery ring that would take their experience potions and sell them on the in-game black market
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> But the anime I usually show people who aren't into anime is One Punch Man
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <greg1756> GG
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> It has the perfect mix of humor/characters/animation for me
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Zismarith> That's a good basic starter kit anime.
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Jmarkwith> I liked 7 deadly sins on netflix
[06/6/19, 1:41:54 PM] <Zismarith> My Hero Academia would also be good for beginners.
[06/6/19, 1:41:55 PM] <yarumar> Inuyasha

[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <Zismarith> I think there's just a button in the settings for that.
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <sShaymus> put voice chat option to autojoin and it should join for the next game ?
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <greg1756> I think it's in the settings part rather than in the VC part
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <greg1756> is it on PTT?
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <Zismarith> I think it was, yes.
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <sShaymus> oh weird :(
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <sShaymus> unluckers
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <Zismarith> I've seen OW drop mic in the middle of a round for no reason lots of times, and I don't even play.
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <radarhere> The game knows what is best for you
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <radarhere> Voice chat being broken isn't a bug, it's a feature
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <d4niel_p> there's an intermittent bug with voice chat for more than a week now
[06/6/19, 1:41:56 PM] <sShaymus> one of those games lol, go next
[06/6/19, 1:41:57 PM] <d4niel_p> but tbh I wouldn't risk playing comp with vc on in gold/plat live on stream Kappa

[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <Ossborn> If audio books count.... the german Sci Fi novel series "Perry Rhodan NEO". Started 3 years ago, when there were 180 books already and am currently in #67
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <greg1756> Hank Green sorry - "An Absolutely remarkable thing" and I'm listening to friend of the show Ben Mekler's Mortal Podkast
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <Ossborn> NEO is a reboot from 2012, the original series started back in the 50s and has way over 4000 issues by now, so NEO may be way easier to catch up ^^
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <Ossborn> Not 50s, 60s...
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <waningdonut> i think a support hero whose ult reduces friendly cooldowns and/or extends opponents cooldowns
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <waningdonut> would be cool
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <greg1756> it's fantastic - he even sung the them tune himself and it's so Mekler xD
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <sShaymus> there was talk of Echo taking on other heros abilities, like a ditto kinda cooldown, mightb be broken tho :/
[06/6/19, 1:41:58 PM] <greg1756> Batiste is a baller backline healer
