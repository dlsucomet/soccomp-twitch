[06/6/19, 2:04:54 PM] <ApatrosMiner> @bartles009 looking at the kickstarter page, you arent really pledging, you're just buying the game. but it makes you feel good for "pledging".
[06/6/19, 2:04:54 PM] <bartles009> Right lol. And i guess if it's under skybound then it should definitly should be coming out. Im just always skeptical of prebuying something I won't get for a year LUL
[06/6/19, 2:04:54 PM] <bartles009> What does mordak have against dwarfs!

[06/6/19, 2:04:57 PM] <bartles009> That's what he gets for attacking the dwarf so much
