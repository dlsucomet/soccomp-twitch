[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <allixadas> space whale
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <cinphoria> every single Eric game is obligated to have space whales

[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <darkofnate> Eric can't go to space without whales.
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <Jeroth42> @namillus I'm surprised it held out this long. :D
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <ArisBranwin> Wait.. we have Space Whales?
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <listersmate1105> Is Doctor Who going to show up with Amy & Rory? ☺
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <janetheunicorn> @RJLadyA I hadn't thought of that...this changes everything! *Starts up backup Sam energy* Let there be glitter clouds!
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <KBTibbs> @darkofnate Who would want to?
[06/8/19, 1:02:12 PM] <Jimersion> There was a space whale in SoT. Tried to mate with the Ride.

[06/8/19, 1:02:13 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Outside the ordered universe is that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

[06/8/19, 1:02:15 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Parallel to the life we know, perhaps in another dimension, there is a different force from that which generates our life. Perhaps this force emits energy, or something similar to energy, which passes from the unknown dimension where it is and creates a new form of life in our dimension.

[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Focus on Cass
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <ExcessiveWarlock> Cass.
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <KBTibbs> Hector, if there's one thing I learned from the Flash, it's that all your problems are solved by your superpower.
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <ClearSkiesStats> Home is where the heart is, so your real home's in your chest
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <BiblioTeq> Feel for the rest of the team, Oya!
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <gtroke> Look for where you hang your hat.
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <Corpsehandler> best possible focus, really.
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <thatsuperrandomgirl> Follow the coffee
[06/8/19, 1:02:28 PM] <Corpsehandler> it's the heart of the home.

[06/8/19, 1:02:29 PM] <SnowHermit> I like how Eric gives them successes without rolling sometimes. I know there is a rule for "you're so high you don't have to roll", but it's still good to see.
[06/8/19, 1:02:29 PM] <Akeluus> ... Oh Gods, they WILL find the way home by smell! {:3 <3

[06/8/19, 1:02:29 PM] <Suedyin> @HatefulJerk absolutely! some GM's also give successes based on skill of roleplay over a period, rather than rolling skill checks- have seen it with Ruty Rutenberg and Kyle Voigt

[06/8/19, 1:02:34 PM] <Suedyin> oh, but memories flux... they are iterated stories we tell ourselves... where does memory end and identity begin?
[06/8/19, 1:02:34 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Have some cookies between time, space, and reality
[06/8/19, 1:02:34 PM] <FuffyButt> Abuela doesn't make cookies. she gives you a full plate of food and watches you eat it

[06/8/19, 1:02:34 PM] <darkofnate> Very few people describe themselves as malevolent.
[06/8/19, 1:02:34 PM] <harberst> To be fair something that's malevolent would probably say benevolent anyway...
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Suedyin> on the upside, I learned one can rewrite identity due to past trauma, by rewriting the memory
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Shadowsoflife> @namillus Nice
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Vance1982> Nothing in life is ever easy
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <harberst> So that's not a great first question
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Namillus> +1: Scry 4, then draw two cards.
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Celador_Mythica> @FuffyButt - My parents were abusive and neglectful. I would have died if it wasn't for my friends and their abuelas.

[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <Suedyin> @Vance1982 so true
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <ExcessiveWarlock> No, it is too much. Let me sum up.
[06/8/19, 1:02:35 PM] <ApatrosMiner> Everybody deserves an Abuela

[06/8/19, 1:02:55 PM] <Celador_Mythica> The common belief that visual consciousness is a direct translation of the information the visual sensory organs collect. Perceptual awareness pretends to have access to more information than is actually available to visual cognition. Tinkerbell's revival depends on the live audience expressing their belief in fairies through clapping. The Tinkerbell effect points out a significant flaw in the brain's system of receiving and interpreting visually available information: it is not directly represe

[06/8/19, 1:03:10 PM] <Suedyin> although, @Geekouts , my impression is that the tabaxi lore is not so deep nor characteristic as that of khajiit
[06/8/19, 1:03:10 PM] <janetheunicorn> *Starts pulling out boxes of kigurumis* @Jeroth42 these should help too.
[06/8/19, 1:03:10 PM] <thrythlind> Tabaxi pre=date khajit...so it's more accurate to say that the khajit are tabaxi
[06/8/19, 1:03:10 PM] <Akeluus> It actually would be cool if Moonlight became their Superpower Cleric; utilizing C gandsC6 energy to heal/restore them {:3

[06/8/19, 1:03:30 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Squick it in the grundel.

[06/8/19, 1:03:57 PM] <VermillionCrimson> YEET
[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <KBTibbs> Listen, Anton gets to yeet Oya to balance how he yoinked her at the beginning of the round.

[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <KBTibbs> Anton yoinks and yeets in equal measure.
[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <SkipFoo> what if he pushed himself back some
[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Anton has power shifts in ALL THE FEELS
[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <Davecom3> darn you, Anton. gotta be the hero.
[06/8/19, 1:03:58 PM] <shidareAKI> @mangoscream understandable, but remember 1) this is Hector's character, no one knows better than he would what Anton would do

[06/8/19, 1:03:59 PM] <SkipFoo> @mangoscream its really great when you can kinda love a character and it invokes feeling.
[06/8/19, 1:03:59 PM] <hannaHananaB> Throwing Oya is exactly what Anton would do. It made complete sense. Do I like it? No, but it's true to character

[06/8/19, 1:03:59 PM] <mangoscream> @SkipFoo that's why i love this cast so much is that i genuinely care about the characters like they actually exist and i feel all the feels

[06/8/19, 1:03:59 PM] <Celador_Mythica> SUPERHERO - A heroic character with a selfless, pro-social mission; with superpowers who has a superhero identity embodied in a codename and iconic costume, which typically express his biography, character, powers, or origin (transformation from ordinary person to superhero); and who is generically distinct, i.e. can be distinguished from characters of related genres (fantasy, science fiction, detective, etc.) by a preponderance of generic conventions.

[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <ClearSkiesStats> and we were all impressed with dc12 30 minutes ago...
[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <shidareAKI> Antooooon
[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <Namillus> Worm's basically out of play because it thinks it's bound.
[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <Lei_Hng_Wei> @DarkestArgentum Difficulty # x 3 = roll
[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <BarGamer> @Davecom3 And then a nat 20?

[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <KaiOrAya> I like Amy's math. 9 times 3 = too many
[06/8/19, 1:04:00 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Oh no!!!
