[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <DarkestArgentum> Okay seriously i looked at Fairbanks tomb at hollywood forever and theres only 2 positions that could work and one would be SUPER uncomfortable and the guy would have to be fairly tall either way
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <willsample> Feels more like a Potential Stepmom and Dad situation, imo
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> LORE DROP
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <Nemisar> props!
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <RiniBelle> Not upsetting at all. :3
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <tommygunangels> @Funkymarkykai Victor texted Fiorenza a picture of the lick and she texted "RUN"
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <derfnoogan> fyi that is totally based on RL history of Griffith Park.
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <kaeleakae> @darkestargentum Undad is notably very tall ;p
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <RaitheFae> Ack! Handling old paper without gloves. For shame, Jasper!
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <bosmerian> undad is so tall
[06/8/19, 2:11:36 PM] <ghosthack159> any thoughts on who is going to guest star as lucita?

[06/8/19, 2:11:38 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Scary shadow woman
[06/8/19, 2:11:38 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> That was the first thing they did. They photographed everything with their phones
[06/8/19, 2:11:38 PM] <bosmerian> @slightsprite thanks!!
[06/8/19, 2:11:38 PM] <LunarLorkhan> but they already told Annabelle about them! lol
[06/8/19, 2:11:38 PM] <Durandal2100> ah, anabelle's notebook
[06/8/19, 2:11:39 PM] <Funkymarkykai> @tommygunangels doubt it's lucita though, she wouldn't stoop so low to work for a chump like vanny

[06/8/19, 2:11:39 PM] <truth_decay> @pekoe212 slightly afraid and turned on. I get u. :D
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> ward has a different energy at the table tonight
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <derfnoogan> if she were Lucita, they would all be dead.
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <highvoltage988> @pekoe212 I think it's both a makeup adjustment and new lighting. The crew adds so much to the story
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <RiniBelle> Write it in the notebook!
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <ghosthack159> @funkymarkykai you assume shes a lackie, and not using vanivar
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <Targa_X> I don't know anything about the game, or game rules, but I just have to say that the Twitch layout, background images, and costumes are simply killer!
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <jamiadixon> Lasombra <3
[06/8/19, 2:11:40 PM] <Swoosh2355> Baby B has made a note.

[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @YokeThatOneBloke ehhh kinda except he couldn't make your own shadow turn into blades and stab you with them
[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <Jimersion> It's blank.
[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <truth_decay> I'm glad they fixed the lighting honestly... During the Jasper/Eva epilogue of season 2, the lighting kept making it look like his nose was dripping... but it was just a shadow :D

[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> I think they posted the picture on Twitter.
[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <Anachrontopian_Prime> Much like Bigfoot, LaSombra are naturally blurry.
[06/8/19, 2:11:41 PM] <TacticalPinup> I mean... I had one flesh craft ropes for me in a Sabbat Chronicle.

[06/8/19, 2:11:42 PM] <thisjus10> yeah not based in fact but also Lasombra are vampires I bet their curse is more complicated than "doesn't show up in mirrors"
[06/8/19, 2:11:42 PM] <crusaderbro> Victor is a walking masquerade breach
[06/8/19, 2:11:42 PM] <Akeluus> It's a picture of what looks like the two of you trying to settle a Wiggly Black Labradore down {:3

[06/8/19, 2:11:42 PM] <shidareAKI> @VermillionCrimson it may be ambient noise from the music
[06/8/19, 2:11:42 PM] <RiniBelle> When is he not?

[06/8/19, 2:11:43 PM] <Funkymarkykai> he just drinks vamp blood, he doesn't give them the max succ, @Swoosh2355
[06/8/19, 2:11:43 PM] <DarkestArgentum> for those that don't know the Giovani are the vampire mob they specalise in Necromancy (and phellia) and the human members of the family (cause they are acctually a family) are know to be...very game of thrones in their marrage choices if you follow
[06/8/19, 2:11:43 PM] <truth_decay> @Swoosh2355 Yup, no diablerie, just drained. Sucked the vitae, not the soul.
[06/8/19, 2:11:44 PM] <RiniBelle> I thought he already said 'no thanks'?
[06/8/19, 2:11:44 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Yeah, it wasn't diablerie.

[06/8/19, 2:12:07 PM] <harberst> What part of "Don't tell people" does Annabelle not understand? By this point she knows the higher ranking vamps wouldn't hesitate to end any masquerade leaks.

[06/8/19, 2:12:08 PM] <Dragonchrome> !wtfisthis
[06/8/19, 2:12:08 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. Tonight, personal and political pressures intensify as the coterie attempts to regroup in the wake of new Camarilla aggression.
[06/8/19, 2:12:08 PM] <prismaticfaerie> If Lucita is here... oh fuck

[06/8/19, 2:12:08 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[06/8/19, 2:12:09 PM] <MissNayoung> Now Mark is in even more danger than he was before.
[06/8/19, 2:12:09 PM] <highvoltage988> @FortressofTrees I don't think it's been announced, but each season is typically 8 episodes (with maybe a bonus episode thanks to Backblaze sponsorship)

[06/8/19, 2:12:21 PM] <tw1zt84> My thought is Victor is letting Anna get this out of her system, and then he will memory wipe Mark

[06/8/19, 2:12:21 PM] <nifelfang> I would be pissed if i was mark. he dont know they are vampires, he only know annabelle is in danger and she wont tell him so he isnt in danger. that would piss me off to no end

[06/8/19, 2:12:30 PM] <harberst> @Funkymarkykai I think she's a vampire too; iirc Victor mentioned something about them being turned at around the same time.
[06/8/19, 2:12:30 PM] <Dragonchrome> everyone in a 5 mile radius can hear them

[06/8/19, 2:12:31 PM] <johjohz> Annabelle is very ideologically belligerent but you'd think she'd learn
[06/8/19, 2:12:31 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> the look on Nelli's face XD
[06/8/19, 2:12:31 PM] <TheGreenman> bond him to victor. he'll just be a normal millennial kid

[06/8/19, 2:12:31 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Annabelle I care about you a lot. But there are reasons why people don’t tell others. So we don’t have to make these choices.

[06/8/19, 2:12:32 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @Axeface_the_1st It *can* but it's really unpleasant. kindred blood is like an addiction to ghouls that persist-- it's an in game condition you get.
[06/8/19, 2:12:32 PM] <krazyflower> I'm still not over him calling him "Victor" and not "Dad"

[06/8/19, 2:12:50 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <sherconshadow> for the jump scare
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <StaticTTV> Victor should have ghouled him, it's his fam
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <highvoltage988> I think Erika would call Annabelle pan, not bi. Semantics really, but matters to some people. PansexualPride BisexualPride
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Zismarith> No, but she did chuck a 4x4 at someone that one time.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <krazyflower> Annabelle has a *lot* of wiling donors/targets.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Swoosh2355> Ya but Belle is 13th gen, if she embraces him...
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <willsample> You know, Jasper and Eva's date may not go as well.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <complainthat> Nelli was laughing at the OVER overacting
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <bear_wonder> annabelle did kill someone when she used the madness on the two guys

[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Swoosh2355> or something like that
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <dicealex> the 4'th choice make Mark a kindrid.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Eredai> I thought Annabelle was 12th generation

[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <complainthat> lmao
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Erika is Killing it.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <BubbleGumBlood> technically annabelles spark of rage killed a dude
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> well yeah, people who get bit over time constantly get addicted to it.
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Gah, we still have Jasper and Eva after this... I totally forgot
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <LunarLorkhan> true she did kill with spark of rage
[06/8/19, 2:12:57 PM] <Om1nous> My thoughts exactly Jason. /takes sip.
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <StaticTTV> you dont, you ain't people ne more
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <highvoltage988> Love and Fear is a great episode title. Jason Carl you magnificent Ess Oh Bee

[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <Chovexani> awwwww
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <LunarLorkhan> if indirectly
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> they don't have to be ghouls
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <truth_decay> I think Jasper and Eva have a "fight" date. No way THAT is going well..
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <shidareAKI> p r e a c h
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> kiss or ghoul

[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <david_blake> @Swoosh2355 Then he wil be 14th gen, BUT not neceserally thin-blood
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <erixdarageknight> no Annabelle is 13th generation
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <Funkymarkykai> 12 or 13?

[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <PAPerryman> Brilliant
[06/8/19, 2:12:58 PM] <Vance1982> Annie is a 13th gen she has a 50/50 chance of sireing a thinblood
[06/8/19, 2:12:59 PM] <the_wynd> how many generations before they are a thin blood?
[06/8/19, 2:12:59 PM] <KBTibbs> AND IT GOT ANNABELLE MURDERED

[06/8/19, 2:12:59 PM] <nifelfang> no she cant, if annabelle ghouls him, she cannot trust him to be honest with her. he will say what he thinks she want to hear

[06/8/19, 2:13:03 PM] <RiniBelle> Couldn't Eva break the bond, if it gets to be too much? I know it wasn't easy, but she managed to do it before.

[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <MissNayoung> THere is a song lyric that really fits Annabelle at this moment. It simply says "Loving you is complicated."
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <krazyflower> "I haven't had animal products in 12 years" is a line that a screen writer wishes they thought of.
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <RiniBelle> Vegan Ghoul

[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <Shadowsoflife> @Planet_Winfinite Indeed
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <Vance1982> Vegan vampire is drinking animal blood
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <StaticTTV> Looks like meats back on the menu mark LUL
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <shidareAKI> that is Victor's son

[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> At least vampires can give consent?
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <TacticalPinup> All I can think is fucking Twilight now lol
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <shidareAKI> 100%
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> @david_blake Not talking about that. Annabelle refused to to blood bond Ellenore but is going to blood bond Mark.
[06/8/19, 2:13:05 PM] <highvoltage988> @nerdgirl54 yes, Annabelle is poly and a big part of poly relationships is openness, honesty, and trust
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <RagAhroun> @nerdgirl54 Yes, they know about each other. Poly relationship.
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <Jmaniac86> hes jumping straight from vegan to cannibal...
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <willsample> At least it'll still be locally sourced.
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <HopefulNinja> Mark is much quicker than Annabelle about this stuff huh
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> GHOUL! HIM! GHOUL! HIM! GHOUL! HIM!
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <nerdypatty> YOu once were a Vgone now you will be gone! LUL
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <Corpsehandler> OK BUT, being a ghoul is aligned with vegan principles BECAUSE the blood is taken with explicit consent from the giver.
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <GryphonCompanion> @TacticalPinup This is by far better than Twilight.
[06/8/19, 2:13:06 PM] <RiniBelle> Healthy poly relationships, for the win!

[06/8/19, 2:13:54 PM] <Splattercatt> @Dokka78 Nah dude, it's good. Just that you're accustomed to doing what you do so you feel it's an everyday thing. It's not. You're awesome at what you do. :)
[06/8/19, 2:13:54 PM] <mithrilmist> DO any of us truly exist, @Vampire_Vaxildan
[06/8/19, 2:13:54 PM] <Vampire_Vaxildan> Erika is so dedicated

[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Erika is amazing, but this dude who plays Mark, damn, hes so cool and natural
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <highvoltage988> I missed Tower of Madness, gonna have to check that one out
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <MissNayoung> Mark has become a big fat target now. I hope Annabelle is willing to live with what comes next from her decision.
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <chaoticloony> @highvoltage988 It was so fabulous
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <Swoosh2355> On the next episode...Belle runs into Marks twin and starts talking about it all... gandsFacepalm
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <JeffM0307> @highvoltage988 We're rebroadcasting the whole thing tomorrow
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <sparklegemlongbottom> Marks going to be a problem
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <KaiOrAya> <---Still hoping We're Alive Frontier gets reposted so I can finish the series
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <gundammac0311> gundammac0311 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months!

[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <paladinelmo360> if feel like the kind of person belle is.. shes ONLY going to learn the hard way
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> Mark's been a problem the whole time, he just gettin' some spotlight. This gonna get gnarly.
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <Vampire_Vaxildan> is this the most intense episode of LABN So far?
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <StaticTTV> dont get too attached LUL
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <Splattercatt> @MissNayoung That's the problem with having a conscience. She's so busy wanting him to keep his free will that she doesn't realize that he loses it when he's dead... :/
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <highvoltage988> @JeffM0307 yeah if I'm not busy I think I'll catch this game and the first half of Nyctophobia, which is all I missed live last week
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <vcolev> it's called world of darkness for a reason
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <paladinelmo360> play stupid games win stupid prizes
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> he's not dead... yet. Only mostly dead.
[06/8/19, 2:13:55 PM] <sparklegemlongbottom> Oh it could be much worse
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Jimersion> *crash*
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Akeluus> Ivan, you dork <3
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <paladinelmo360> it will get much worse

[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <CainTheConfused> WHOOPS.
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <thisjus10> @paladinelmo360 yeah, I'm just thinking of the rook jumping in the way of something for his "queen" and everything going to shit
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> :D
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <cinphoria> We're at break
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <DarkestArgentum> man ivan running 10 candles was ROUGH
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <cinphoria> coming back in about 5
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Zismarith> @Your_Local_Doggo Nah, potty break.
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Dragonchrome> we are in the break , maybe about 5 mins left of break
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> @Your_Local_Doggo Break
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <MissNayoung> @Splattercatt That's so very true. She's been a vampire for a few months now but she stills acts like it's her first day. It's frustrating but also sad knowing how her decisions will affect her and those she cares about.
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <thisjus10> hiiiii @cinphoria <3
[06/8/19, 2:13:56 PM] <JeffM0307> The Kerplunk of Sundry
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> Pee! Pee now!
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <cinphoria> hi thisjus10 !
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Chovexani> I came in when they were making the choice about Mark did I miss anything major before that?
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Vampire_Vaxildan> Best of all, the best Vampire is about to be on screen! jcvimHearts gandsAnnabella jcvimHearts
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <kefneji> I’m disappointed in Annabelle. She should be against blood bonds but this is twice she’s acted like they aren’t so bad. I hope she loses a point of Humanity for this, it will make her a better leader.
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <paladinelmo360> @thisjus10 big facts.. i didn't even think about it that way
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Akeluus> Ivan's 10 Candles Game... I caught it from the middle, and it was still **heartwrenching!** ;n; </3
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <sparklegemlongbottom> He was blowing up building with her and now he is a ghoul. This can go sooo many ways.
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Is that basically kerplunk?
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <KaiOrAya> Made a pull, knocked the tower down. Ivan's here so he must have died?
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <thisjus10> @Akeluus yeah! I ran 10 candles about a month ago. It's like that
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <StaticTTV> @missnayoung undad and mom need to corporal punishment her
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <thisjus10> we cried at the end
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> anyone else remember Kerplunk?
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <truth_decay> Kerplunk of Cthulu
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Onairic> I think this is more about Annabelle respecting Victor's decisions, because she knows she messed up in letting Mark know stuff about their world
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> lol
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <chaoticloony> This is G&S, there are no real Sane people!
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> Cthuplunk
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <USAgent88> @MissNayoung Yeah, I would like to see her grow and actually learn about Kindred society. It's been long enough that she should know more.
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <shidareAKI> @chaoticloony IHNIWYTA
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <StaticTTV> @usagent88 agree
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <truth_decay> holy shit. doom marbles. So ominous
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> omfg the marbles are even the same as kerplunk! XD
[06/8/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Akeluus> 10 Candles seems like far too entropic a game for me to enjoy playing. Ivan's game was brutal... and I still watched to the end ;w;
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <cinphoria> doooOOOooOoooom marbles
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <thisjus10> @USAgent88 i mean 2l.5 months is nothing she's way a head of the curve
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <CainTheConfused> "The good guys win..." Well, it's nice to dream. slackHa
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Critternation3000> is this a break or did vampire end?
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <ludastyles17> "and i raaaannn, i ran so far awaaaaayy..."
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> ah, I heard him describe that game to Mercer - would like to watch that
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Splattercatt> @USAgent88 The problem is she's resisting it so hard. There are reasons their society is so complicated and she see's everything in black and white.
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Dragonchrome> #MarblesOfDOOOOM!!!
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <thisjus10> break @Critternation3000

[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <thisjus10> also jcvimHi
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <kefneji> Lol this isn’t her fixing her mistakes, this is her not listening to all the information she’s been given and making another. Zero self awareness or consistency. Worst kind of “leader”.
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Dragonchrome> 2 mins of break left, start bringing it back in folks, what will happen next???
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @thisjus10
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> ya, tragic consequences is why the Camarilla was invented, amirite?

[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <StaticTTV> @kef
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Swoosh2355> Someone is gonna punish them
[06/8/19, 2:13:58 PM] <Dragonchrome> It'sFIne
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <VermillionCrimson> Any idea if the ITTD2019 shows are gonna be uploaded to YT?
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <sgbee816> Chelseeeaaa
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Akeluus> I **LOVE** Ancient Boardgames! ^w^
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <VermillionCrimson> or games rather.
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <truth_decay> The way she says caucuses. Makes me want to meme it. :D
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <VermillionCrimson> I should've said games :P
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <highvoltage988> @VermillionCrimson some of them have already
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> I like her nail color
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> Nothing wrong with making ghouls, typically
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Eredai> Imagine the Inquistion, not the Camarilla, taking advantage of this
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Critternation3000> @vermillioncrimson some already are
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Talisen Jaffe probably played it
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <PAPerryman> Rebroadcast of ITTD happens starts tomorrow BTW
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <VermillionCrimson> Cool beans.
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <RJLadyA> I don't know a single human that would react like Annabelle when shown the existence of vampires. that's all.
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Dragonchrome> 1 min of break left folks
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Splattercatt> I watched Becca on the Magic event stream. That lady is a BOSS at covering those events!
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Lordofdragons073> could you make another vampire believe that their a 5 year old?
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Chaox173> gandsRaid
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> The biggest victim here thus far is Victor, really
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <USAgent88> @thisjus10 I understand to a degree but they should have done a better job explaining things to her. She makes a lot more mistakes than she should at this point.
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <Corpsehandler> all these look amazing
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <CainTheConfused> Nyctophobia was...interesting. Not my kind of game, but...it was nice to see Alex scaring people slackHa
[06/8/19, 2:13:59 PM] <thisjus10> @kefneji I mean she's like in her early 20's she just got passion and charisma, and can motivate people but yeah she's super flawed like everyone else
[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <Nemisar> this show was a lot of shame
[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <Nemisar> or game
[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <tw1zt84> gandsBing gandsBong
[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <chaoticloony> This is such a cool Bored game!

[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Gina!
[06/8/19, 2:14:00 PM] <highvoltage988> I was dying laughing this whole game. I'd never watched Asinine Wisdom before but I'm very glad it's coming back so I can see more

[06/8/19, 2:14:01 PM] <kossowan_kenobi> Did they touch on loresheets at all? I don't recall, but thought it was a cool idea in 5E.

[06/8/19, 2:14:02 PM] <thisjus10> @USAgent88 mistakes make things interesting. to be honest I think most people don't mess up enough particularly if they're playing the "I'm a new vampire part" vampire is rely a game about horror, messing up and feelings.

[06/8/19, 2:14:02 PM] <USAgent88> @thisjus10 It just seems like it's stubborn or willful resistance to learning anything about the world she's part of. It'll make for some brutal wake up calls though.

[06/8/19, 2:14:04 PM] <kefneji> Charisma isn’t enough to be a leader. She says she fights gif freedom then laughs at Raggs becoming a slave and then bonds her boyfriend. She says she’ll “do whatever it takes” and then looks at those around her to do it because she refuses. Her Humanity and lack of self awareness are the biggest flaws for what she’s supposed to be doing: leading a revolution.
[06/8/19, 2:14:04 PM] <mithrilmist> Yay! EVA!

[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> I'm sure Jasper's a smart enough lad to clean up his place before Eva comes over. Also I don't know if she knows about his feeding preferences
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <truth_decay> I get the feeling that Eva might kick his ass for turning her in to a baby sitter of his living life GF.

[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @willsample That's shown on the fifth date
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <VermillionCrimson> @Swoosh2355 I doubt a cage could hold Eva.
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Brisk90> ewww, locks the door behind her...
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> wonder if shell find the chloe picture
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <sgbee816> He went to IKEA
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <the_wynd> It's not *not* clean
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Akeluus> It's like Hoggle's door in the Oobliette; goes somewhere different depending on how it's opened
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <vcolev> naspers going to cage her and use her as his vending machine since he eat his last one
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Durandal2100> and here's where eva sees the photo of chloe
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Swoosh2355> his fangs would burn off too..

[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <cinphoria> IKEA goths are valid
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <ALK824> I think Jasper trying to do anything to Eva would end extremely poorly for him. She's much more powerful than he is.
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Jimersion> But where's the mirror?
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <andy_lnas> ohh the photo
[06/8/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Swoosh2355> is his picture hidden?

[06/8/19, 2:14:15 PM] <CainTheConfused> Nothing is as sexy as showing your books to a tremere, or, something
[06/8/19, 2:14:15 PM] <truth_decay> I'm honestly surprised how "chill" and not strained the interactions are currently, considering the events of the epilogue. Perhaps their love runs deeper than I imagined.

[06/8/19, 2:14:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> "I don't use the cells anymore"

[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <faethepagann> @Vance1982 such a tease
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <Akeluus> Nelli dressed to kill 0w0 <3
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <ArsMythica> That was a fantastic scene.
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <kaeleakae> Waaaaaah I wanted a Jeva smooch!
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <ALK824> low-key Eva collecting everyone's blood though...
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Damnit! Everyone already had a full 90 minutes
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <clerics_kill> When did she have time to change?
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <larilyon> Was she just sitting there the entire time?
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <LunarLorkhan> time to hear from Abrams again
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> This feels like the episode that the Coterie originally thought last episode was going to be before Jason pulled a surprise.
[06/8/19, 2:14:53 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Give Jasper and Eva theirs!
[06/8/19, 2:14:54 PM] <truth_decay> <3 drugs on the sly

[06/8/19, 2:14:55 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Two of my favorite Toreador :D
[06/8/19, 2:14:55 PM] <shidareAKI> C6 and LAbN did not come to play today. Both shows really turned it out.

[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> oh-oh
[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <CaptianTrips88> "The Old Enemy"
[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <prismaticfaerie> ....I don't trust Abrams right now...
[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <PAPerryman> Antitribue Lassambra?
[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> oh boy
[06/8/19, 2:14:57 PM] <shidareAKI> I like Esper because Esperanza means "hope" or "expectation" and I think that's perfect for Jasper and Eva

[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <TurtleGooshGoosh> RIP Sabbat :(
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I do not trust Abrams fully either
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <shadow1980> 0_0
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <zodiacleopard> IB and Fiorenza have been around those cities
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <clerics_kill> Leave us out of this
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <Wasp2374> Chicago by night hype
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <TBone1316> Not the Lasombra :(
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <mystic_skittles> Half the lasombra fled to the camarilla. the other half went to the middle east
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <jesusspicy> @paperryman in V5 the lasombra joined the camarilla
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <RagAhroun> Chicago by Night is covering the transition, but Lasombra are leaving the Sabbat and joining the Camarilla there.
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <HopefulNinja> Do you think Vannevar's desperation has something to do with The Beckoning?
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <PAPerryman> Scary
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <Your_Local_Doggo> Lasombra are sik af
[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <StaticTTV> the sword of Caine yo

[06/8/19, 2:14:58 PM] <akhenatron> It's a trap!
[06/8/19, 2:14:59 PM] <MissNayoung> Abrams has ears and eyes everywhere so of course he'd be up-to-date on any curious happenings going on.
[06/8/19, 2:14:59 PM] <RecorderEvans> The Camerilla obtaining Lasombra is BAAAAD
[06/8/19, 2:14:59 PM] <StaticTTV> lambrosia is sabbat, yup

[06/8/19, 2:14:59 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> The radio person?
[06/8/19, 2:14:59 PM] <CainTheConfused> And so, the reason for the radio openings steps in

[06/8/19, 2:15:00 PM] <complainthat> @rodrigo_720 the tower casts an awfully large shadow, after all.
[06/8/19, 2:15:00 PM] <Elkara_Draco> Water is bad, right? (Still unsure to all... bad juju things)

[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <marchenjager> Please make Deb by Night cannon
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I wonder if we will get a guest playing VV some day
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <KBTibbs> It's a good book and movie
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <kuroiryu009> vv

[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <GeekandSundry> he's giving her a safe haven, that's nice
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <MissNayoung> Stardust. Cody Rhodes is a vampire now!?
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <akhenatron> The early 70s were a strange time for vampires...
[06/8/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Anachrontopian_Prime> We are stardust, we are golden...
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <lschantz> @marchenjager She is cannon, she was in the video game Bloodlines
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <clanjasper> Oh no you don't. Nellie wtf?
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Akeluus> ZIGGY Stardust! >w<
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Corpsehandler> no VV yet
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Jungle_Soraka> I'm sure he's giving her a haven just out of the kindness of his undead heart
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <LunarLorkhan> giving her a safe haven but i still dislike Abrams attitude lately lol
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Edlitham3> Therese is the problem, not Jeannette
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Don't play coy with us, @GeekandSundry
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <StaticTTV> @geekandsundry too keep an eye on her no doubt
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <complainthat> @akhenatron lol!
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Splattercatt> I'd be more scared if it was Goldust.
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Dragonchrome> totes @Jungle_Soraka
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <GryphonCompanion> @GeekandSundry Too many Chaz vibes coming off of Abrams in that moment. Nelli reacting the same way she did around Chaz as well.
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Ziln00bas> Jeanette hears lots of voices. in her head.
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <PAPerryman> Or Angeldust...
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Anachrontopian_Prime> Only the beer light to guide us...
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Goldust is best!
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> I want Beckett to show up now lol
[06/8/19, 2:15:03 PM] <nifelfang> @OldGodSola the clan is so odd, but yes, i like the idea of illusionists. Make the players doubt their own senses. Never played a game with ravnos, but making a ravnos villan would be super fun
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <StaticTTV> @geekandsundry also get these ppl in a DLC for bloodlines 2 plox
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <MrDumpsterBaby81> linHey

[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <lschantz> @StaticOccult THe new game is in Seattle
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <bosmerian> scourgeee secrecyy
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <HopefulNinja> I feel like Abrams is a pushy fucker, but its more "I am the Baron" than Chaz's domestic abuser thing. But he's still being a shitlord.
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <johjohz> I need Theo Bell to show up I will squee so hard
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <poettwist> We need Beckett!
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <StaticTTV> yes @lschantz
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Yeah. It feels similar. Just scares me for Nelli.
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Better to survive the Lasombra than the alternative
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <HopefulNinja> ew brad

[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <mithrilmist> Milan? Is that like Budapest?
[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <RagAhroun> Nelli and Abrahms have history - they used to hunt Sabbat together, or at least Lasombra.

[06/8/19, 2:15:04 PM] <MissNayoung> Abrams has considerable power and is not afraid to throw his weight around.
[06/8/19, 2:15:05 PM] <OldGodSola> @nifelfang yeah the illusionist part is what got me the most interested in them, and when I heard that they're pretty much dead in the current run it hurt a bit
[06/8/19, 2:15:05 PM] <HopefulNinja> probs fiorenza, cuz of ib

[06/8/19, 2:15:05 PM] <willsample> I'm a little sad that tonight won't have a Fiorenza call.
[06/8/19, 2:15:05 PM] <jamiadixon> uh oh

[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <DarkestArgentum> wait so they don't know about chloie?
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <OldGodSola> but the ravnos have a knack for popping up anywhere and don't really settle anywhere
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <roligsjel> @vcolev Vykos would be the top
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Fiona's ghoul is now Eva's ghoul btw

[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <1dankdesire> do say that
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <LunarLorkhan> aw now I feel a bit bad for Abrams lol
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <MissNayoung> So he's planned for this. INteresting.
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Dragonchrome> serious stuff is serious
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Hmm
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> That was ominous
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> oh fuck
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <RaitheFae> If Abrams stops being able to resist going back east...
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <OldGodSola> @nifelfang You more than likely wouldn't remember meeting a Ravnos, unless they specifically want you to remember. and that is usually not a good thing lol
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <prismaticfaerie> EW
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <PAPerryman> That calling... getting harder to resist
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <1dankdesire> aww Abrams noo
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> abrams is prepared for anything
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Swoosh2355> This whole sceen makes me feel like Nelli is a traitor
[06/8/19, 2:15:06 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Baron Nelli?
[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <prismaticfaerie> What happens if he goes back East, btw?
[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <keepinitcaroline> What is this??

[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <johjohz> Abrams always has plans
[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> ;w; Abrams, you're a tough guy but still..... he was a good boss to the coterie
[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <Dragonchrome> !wtfisthis
[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. Tonight, personal and political pressures intensify as the coterie attempts to regroup in the wake of new Camarilla aggression.

[06/8/19, 2:15:07 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[06/8/19, 2:15:08 PM] <johjohz> The calling is drawing all the elders back to the middle east, its the signs of ghenna. I don't think we have any details about what happens when they get there, they just disappear
[06/8/19, 2:15:08 PM] <pekoe212> yaaaas labyrinth
[06/8/19, 2:15:08 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> Fiorenza said to run. Now Abrams is thinking about peacing out?
[06/8/19, 2:15:08 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I'd watch an entire miniseries with just these two
[06/8/19, 2:15:08 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Spelunking! Lol

[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, @TheGreenman! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 94 points!
[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <nifelfang> @OldGodSola yes, they are much more fun to make as a rare meeting. much like all the klans but the 7 "normal" ones. make the other klans feel super alien and scary. tzimisce is great because how alien they are, but if you meet them all the time, the magic goes away
[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <poettwist> I think something might be happening to Abrams, maybe.
[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Jason is getting a lot better

[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <StaticTTV> muh heart is like a maze yo
[06/8/19, 2:15:09 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Seems like the call East is getting harder for him to ignore, @poettwist
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <RaitheFae> Jasper and Eva step into an Escher woodcut
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <willsample> He's going to show her his stiff. I mean, the one eyed nosferau he keeps covered up. I mean, the body. I mean the torpid thing that dominates his life....wait...there is no way to amke it sound good.

[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <Eredai> This sounds like...a Black Spiral Labyrinth!
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <Akeluus> Jasper "~super deep voice~ ... This castle is a creature of chaos, which can take many incarnations."
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> @Spoiledchestnut It was at the very end of Ep. 1, after everything happened. Victor called her and told her.
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <kukubee> unsettling!
[06/8/19, 2:15:10 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> ooooo

[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Jasper is getting tunnel vision
[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Eredai That's definitely what it sounds like with all of the hints we've been given
[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <kaeleakae> Jason is a legend! Gotta hand it to the players too for fleshing our everything; backstory, havens, contacts, connections to the WoD lore... *chefs kiss*
[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <Anachrontopian_Prime> That's specific

[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <Swoosh2355> she is mostly dead..
[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Unless it's a different mirror
[06/8/19, 2:15:11 PM] <RagAhroun> It has nothing to do with the Black Spiral Dancers. Zelios the architect, Nosferatu.

[06/8/19, 2:15:29 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> dammit Daffodil, you asshole!
[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Book of Nod tells the story of Caine from the kindred point of view
[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <bosmerian> is MARK THE MOLE

[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <Ossborn> @Spoiledchestnut Kind of like the Bible, but from a vampiristic viewpoint (Cain being the first vampire etc.)

[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <fleshhy> @Your_Local_Doggo The book is a top camarilla heresy, they don't believe in it but it talks cryptically about Caine and the origin of vampires
[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <prismaticfaerie> They got to Greg, so hard
[06/8/19, 2:16:12 PM] <galaxycleric> CHLOE
