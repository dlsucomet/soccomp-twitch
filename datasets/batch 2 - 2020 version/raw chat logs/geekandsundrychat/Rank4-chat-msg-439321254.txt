[06/15/19, 3:40:28 PM] <Swoosh2355> They shoulda turned him...
[06/15/19, 3:40:28 PM] <MonkeyPrincess> Jasper's right
[06/15/19, 3:40:28 PM] <MissNayoung> He has a point. Did she really think this was the best choice?
[06/15/19, 3:40:28 PM] <aechonex> I didn't have a choice...but I did
[06/15/19, 3:40:28 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @XcNoFaQuEcX The Tell Tale Games of Geek and Sundry:Jasper will remember this.
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Critternation3000> argh I'm late what I miss?
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Gamerprince333> wait did annabelle tell jasper?
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <lexWOLFhale1> I'm utterly doing a nose pinch out of desperation rn. Jasper is voicing all of our thoughts!
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <geminichild34> again we ask...what happened with Ellenore?
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <kira858> Jasper's the last one to talk lol
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Kandogar> sex is possible there is a discipline for that "breath of life"???
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <krazyflower> *lightbulb* Is Ellenore the mole??
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <aechonex> @MissNayoung agreed
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <pekoe212> after what happened to the other guy you'd think she would have really thought about th econsequences for mark of doing this
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <KBTibbs> "I didn't want to keep lying to him [so I stole a decent chunk of his humanity]"
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <JeffM0307> @Critternation3000 Just the start of the conversation
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Jaser - the one sane man in an insane world
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <jamiadixon> Jasper you made Eva ghoul Chloe.
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Shit, I missed the last 10 minutes! What happened?!
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <KaiOrAya> @Critternation3000 Jasper had the best expression to Annabelle telling him what happened last episode
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <faethepagann> @geminichild34 good point, I'[m curious
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <deathandsaints> [Jasper Disliked That]
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Honesty!
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Corpsehandler> at least you're honest, man.
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <Dragonchrome> @geminichild34 perhaps we will find out, when .....who can say
[06/15/19, 3:40:29 PM] <kaeleakae> Mom and Dad look so done with this shit
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Rats808> @Kandogar not a discipline, just a power all vamps have
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Sex is possible at 8+ humanity
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Nouralogical> Victor you allowed your son to become a ghoul? has Ib taught you nothing?
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <DarkestArgentum> ...also HOW THE HELL Is she enjoyign Sex more as a Vampiure i thoguth Blush of Life didn't work that well?
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <bosmerian> @Critternation3000 annabelle told jasper how she ghouled mark
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Rhaitus> Bad Annabelle, no cookie!
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <junebunnybug> Jasper is the best
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> @DemosthenesHPW Kappa
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <wild_13lue> i can see chat in nellies glasses
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Suedyin> "but I'm still kinda doing it" <3 Jasper... right is right, no matter whether I do it or not
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <boldtSketches> Could you please turn up the sound a bit? The show is always so quiet...
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I just want to say that I don‚Äôt care that Jasper is a monster. We could all learn something about being a decent human from him
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Spoiledchestnut Anna recapping the stuff with Marc to Jasper.
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <geminichild34> @Dragonchrome I am worried she got wiped from Annabelle's mind
[06/15/19, 3:40:30 PM] <Akeluus> Belle's in love with the lad. Just wanted to keep him safe, in her own lovestruck way.
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @prismaticfaerie AHH
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Very high humanity vampires can 'possibly enjoy sex' in the new system.
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <KBTibbs> @Nouralogical Victor is a VERY POOR student of Ib!
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <MonkeyPrincess> How many points does anabelle have in humanity
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <Swoosh2355> and now the consequences...
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <highvoltage988> @Nouralogical you know Victor never listens to anyone but himself :D
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Also! Why Mark and not Marc if he's Marcus?
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <Dragonchrome> only time will tell @geminichild34
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Ahh I see, thanks! @DemosthenesHPW

[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <faethepagann> humanity 8+ you have the potential to enjoy sex
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <willsample> too many, obviously.
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @Ellie181
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <mariacomet> Jasper is so good at explaining to Annabelle when she is in the wrong
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <fleshhy> @MissKittyPower I think she has 8+
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <chaoticloony> Hi @glasswalker80 Welcome
[06/15/19, 3:40:31 PM] <bosmerian> markus is a thing lol
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <Nouralogical> @KBTibbs @highvoltage988 lol
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <GeekandSundry> Hey we got the symbol back!
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <MissNayoung> That's why i love Jasper. He may be a Nosferatu vut there are still elements of his humanity still present.
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <almightydeadpool> hope Mark can keep a secret, because Annebelle sure cant...XD
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> Annabelle is their greatest weapon, and their greatest enemy.
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <highvoltage988> I should have known Victor and Annabelle's talk about Ellenore would be offscreen >.<
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Spoiledchestnut Also, we're the new club for openning night... that's why everyone's fancy.
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <MonkeyPrincess> @fleshhy thanks. that makes sense then
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <willsample> Let's get her on the people killiln' express, and get rid of that pesky humanity!
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <Wasp2374> Jasper is da best
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <kira858> Except Jasper has been making the same mistake
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <Xenocore01> Jasper is a good older brother.
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <ghosthack159> Jasper peeing in the cheerios of life
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Spoiledchestnut And apparently Jasper gets secret passages through the club. :D
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <kira858> very similar mistake, that's why he said he has no room to talk
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <bosmerian> woo!! @GeekandSundry thanks! <3 u guys are awesome
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <ShadowGamer264> jasper is big brother
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Consensualist feeders get a boost to humanity at character creation so she would be 8 by default
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <mightbeabadidea_> I'm getting a Star Trek Security Officer vibe on Erika. :P
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <Ellie181> @Dragonchrome Thanks :)
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <tommygunangels> Okay, one of the things I love about Erika's style is her willingness to go "MISSSSSTAAAAAKE" and fuck up all the ways a neonate would fuck up.
[06/15/19, 3:40:32 PM] <gundammac0311> @geekandsundry grats! gandsHype gandsHype
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <USAgent88> Just tell her to stop breaking the masquerade.

[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <Swoosh2355> Nothing ever goes wrong for these guys...
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <Akeluus> You should heed your own advice, Jasper ;3
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <catrlgirl> honestly japser and Victor are the most human honestly Annabelle and nelli are the least
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @fretbuzz74
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <chaoticloony> But NOTHING EVER goes wrong in the game! :)

[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <jamiadixon> Mark is a half dead man walking.
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <KaiOrAya> @tommygunangels From another actor on this channel, If you stack enough bad ideas on top of eachother they turn into a good idea
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <Suedyin> @MissNayoung absolutely, and we've talked about it before- to me, Jasper seems the most humane and emotionally vulnerable of the four
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Jasper's just trying to get her to learn from his mistakes... which is sweet, but also yes a little hypocritcal... but also probably isn't going to work, from my experience.
[06/15/19, 3:40:33 PM] <cyphus> what did jasper do hmm?

[06/15/19, 3:40:34 PM] <JackalopeLARP> "What do I do next?" "Make some more dumb choices, probably."
[06/15/19, 3:40:34 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Campbell!

[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <Dragonchrome> #GhoulSquad
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <Aeriqui> Is Campbell the mole????
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <Wasp2374> can the real campbell stand up
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <Swoosh2355> #AlltheCampbells
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <gundammac0311> Campbell soup?
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <glasswalker80> Has anyone got a pool started on which major character is going to bite it first?
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <harberst> @highvoltage988 Wave of Doggos actually ;)
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <derfnoogan> Campbell is the mole. :D
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <ParadoxDreams> Which Campbell? Is he a new Campbell?
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> is it Campbell or Lawrence Campbell?
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <ghosthack159> @astrozyth all Campbells are Campbells
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> I like Annabelle's single side bun. :D
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Love Annabelle's outfit in this
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <krazyflower> WHAT DOES IT DO, CAMPBELL??
[06/15/19, 3:40:35 PM] <ladyblogging> newer campbell, i think

[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I definitely don't trust Campbell.... >.>
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Why is Nelli G extra fab today?
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @Celticty
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Rhaitus> Ah, this is Campbell number 2
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Onairic> it's probably just me but cambell's voice is different
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Rhaitus> He is more lively
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <bosmerian> with all the campbells, theres bound to be soup
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <jamiadixon> @Nouralogical Sounds like a Spin Off.
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Zaecus> Missing remote turns on the sun lamps.
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> It doesn‚Äôt open the roof does it?
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <kaeleakae> @ladyblogging Campbell 2.0
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <USAgent88> Eventually I think Belle will get a harsh masquerade lesson.
[06/15/19, 3:40:36 PM] <ladyblogging> he doesn't sound the same as the campbell we know and love
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Jasper needs a new phone
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <RaitheFae> Wait, when did Jasper ditch the flip phone?
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <highvoltage988> @Spoiledchestnut club launch, the Queen has come to reign over her subjects
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Victor opened up a new six pack of Campbells to run security at the new place. He gets them at CostCo, real good prices.
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <gundammac0311> will Ellanore get jelly that Mark is a ghoul and she's not?
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <KBTibbs> 555-VAMP
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <Swoosh2355> oO Campbell making the moves
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <ghosthack159> Um....yeeeeeeah, I can install something on your phone, no worry
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <complainthat> @aeriqui its Annabelle's boyfriend.
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <MonkeyPrincess> Oh that sounds fishy as hell
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <prismaticfaerie> ..........Well, this can't end badly
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <crusaderbro> Nice to see Annabelle doesn't have her jacket for once
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <faethepagann> @YokeThatOneBloke yeah no smart phone for jasper
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Did Campbell not already have their numbers?
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @highvoltage988 As well she should
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <GeekandSundry> @ladyblogging all his former coworkers are dead, he's probably working through some stuff
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <boldtSketches> Oh, he doesn't have a flip phone anymore?
[06/15/19, 3:40:37 PM] <Seventh_Argonaut> I like how Campbell has just become a name for the security goons
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <Dragonchrome> !itsfine
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <Nightbot> We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. Uh, how are you?
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <zodiacleopard> This feels sus
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> this sounds so suspicious
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <kaeleakae> @JackalopeLARP Cheaper in bulk???? xD
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <TOJ8> he sounds odd...
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <KaiOrAya> wait. Jasper finally got a smart phone?
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Campbell does seem odd
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <MissNayoung> @Suedyin Right! Jasper suffers the most out of all 4 but he's the one that does his best to become stronger for it.
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <bosmerian> @JackalopeLARP omg xD Costco Campbells
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <Gamerprince333> campbell is flirting lol
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Oh gods...this will end badly
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <willsample> I wonder if, in emergency feeding situations, Campbell eats like a meal.
[06/15/19, 3:40:38 PM] <omenatural> ....fishy

[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Wasp2374> whats up with the flip phone mau
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @a_complete_longshot
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <ladyblogging> so then maybe he is the campbell?
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Wasp2374> muh cannon
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <ladyblogging> i'm so confused man
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <krazyflower> That's not suspicious at all......
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Aeriqui> Campbell is a plant i'm paranoid
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <thisjus10> I feel like both of those things were horrible. that remote seems important and that was sketchy
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <JackalopeLARP> CostCo Campbells DOES need to be a thing.
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Gray_Mask> 90% a joke the flip phone
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <kaeleakae> @Seventh_Argonaut Victor does have a habit of being TERRIBLE with names
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Well after Campbell was two places at once last week, he's been a bit disoriented
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <inkblotteapot> oh man i missed the start - can someone give me a brief summary?
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Jasper went on a not NOT date!
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> flip phones are harder to hack, so he has one
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <karen86> @krazyflower agreed
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <higgensbiggens> I miss Juan
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Rhaitus> No, Jasper is making all the right moves
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <jamiadixon> lol
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <KBTibbs> Well......
[06/15/19, 3:40:39 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> It had the spirit ward though. I hope it does not wash out that‚Äôs all

[06/15/19, 3:40:52 PM] <MissNayoung> Jasper reminds me of a man that mentored me named Ali Siddiq. Siddiq spent most of his youth in prison and he missed out on the things most men 19 years or younger participate in.
[06/15/19, 3:40:52 PM] <Gamerprince333> yay we get to see lavender
[06/15/19, 3:40:52 PM] <krazyflower> Nelli has a small army of ghouls at this point.

[06/15/19, 3:40:53 PM] <catrlgirl> I'm so confused
[06/15/19, 3:40:53 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Victor, that's not how Ghouls work. :P
[06/15/19, 3:40:53 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @DemosthenesHPW Yes, he ghouled Campbell canonically

[06/15/19, 3:40:53 PM] <krazyflower> If she wasn't so devoted to Victor, Nelli could be her own barony. "Baroness of Beverly Hills."
[06/15/19, 3:40:53 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Spoiledchestnut That's what I thought... he shouldknow then that Nelli and Lavender are "good". :P

[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <krazyflower> @Swoosh2355 He did. The problem is that if the Camarilla accept it as Elysium, it means they consider Victor as the same stature of a Prince.

[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <willsample> the final walk is to the gallows. Just sayin'
[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <Chovexani> Brad the party favor
[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <Zismarith> Never tell Nelli the sofa was 30% off.
[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <crusaderbro> Brad is ALWAYS invited
[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <KBTibbs> Yes Jody
[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> .....he's also the only one Nelli hasn't given a nickname or ghouled

[06/15/19, 3:41:12 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @MissNayoung I imagine Ib would have told him that, and his response would be "but it's badasssssss!"

[06/15/19, 3:41:13 PM] <shadowweaver73> why does Jasper hate Victor so much?
[06/15/19, 3:41:13 PM] <Chovexani> He's a snacc not a friend or useful tool
[06/15/19, 3:41:13 PM] <JackalopeLARP> It would be strange for the new Elysiums of Fifth Edition to be a place inhabited by mortals at night.
[06/15/19, 3:41:13 PM] <Metebelis777> They might buy it as a Salon but yea not as Elysium

[06/15/19, 3:41:16 PM] <myssid> Just slap the ventrue symbol up there
[06/15/19, 3:41:16 PM] <pekoe212> We need more light on Jasper, I want to see what Nelli dressed him in

[06/15/19, 3:41:16 PM] <willsample> @Akeluus - the Ventrue anarch motto, isnt it?
[06/15/19, 3:41:16 PM] <vcolev> haha
[06/15/19, 3:41:16 PM] <KBTibbs> Victor's plan: You can't violate the masquerade if you're YELLING.
[06/15/19, 3:41:17 PM] <Ossborn> Victor.... exploring the limits of a Masquerade breach again ^^

[06/15/19, 3:41:17 PM] <andy_lnas> @JCVIM are you enjoying your jasper-blood sugar jasmine tea gandsAnnabella
[06/15/19, 3:41:17 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Vampires often 'fly their colors' to send a message to other vampires, since the symbols aren't widely known outside of the Kindred.
[06/15/19, 3:41:17 PM] <gundammac0311> @ghosthack159 lol
[06/15/19, 3:41:17 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @YokeThatOneBloke THere's actually a bit in 5E about kindred graffitti for turf claims and such.

[06/15/19, 3:41:18 PM] <Ziln00bas> Vampire clothes are more prone to blood stains than sweat stains.

[06/15/19, 3:41:19 PM] <Splattercatt> Eva is lost in a library somewhere....
[06/15/19, 3:41:19 PM] <gundammac0311> @ziln00bas that's why my Malk wears dark colors lol

[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Xylena_Metapine> @JCVIM does eva trust abrams?
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Akeluus> A new layer of "Ghost Proof Paint" around the club? {:3
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Swoosh2355> Cause Ghosts don't go through the walls?
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <nihilissa77> he is NOT okay
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> "Good for you, Campbell"
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Nelli is tempting fate wearing that white fur coat.
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <tw1zt84> so many campbells
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <willsample> Eva's been too busy perusing Jasper's card catalogue to be involved with the Wyrd Sisters investigation
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <bosmerian> !points cambell
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, cambell! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 74 points!
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Metebelis777> ward lintel vs possessed folk
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <Rhaitus> This is Campbell 1, waaaay too straight laced
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <complainthat> guys i JUST realized that Annabelle is wearing a necklace&that its not in fact part of a star fleet logo.
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <kaeleakae> !points Campbell
[06/15/19, 3:41:20 PM] <enca24> @JackalopeLARP black or the colour red easiest to wash when it gets covered in blood lol jk maybe it fits the atmosphere and style of the game and to role play.
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <JCVIM> @xylena_metapine who could say
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <blind_eyes> Don't tell me victor is leaving
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Zismarith> Zismarith subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months!

[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Deployed twelve more Campbells to be safe from the Campbell Vats.
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @Zismarith
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Corpsehandler> yeah, getting blood out of fur is <sigh>
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Davecom3> why would you Eva suggest she was lost?
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Nemisar> gandsHype gandsLessthanthree Resub Zismarith!
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Swoosh2355> did Lavender just become a Campbell?
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <bosmerian> victor ordered more campbells for the opening :D xD
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @Corpsehandler Synthetic is a lot harder to strain
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <mariacomet> "almost" all
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <gundammac0311> @jackalopelarp are they clones? :o
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Dragonchrome> #CampbellSoup
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <krazyflower> That hooded angle with the light when Jasper looks straight ahead looks very gaunt and has a great effect.
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <JackalopeLARP> "I'm not sure of MacKenzie. He's not a Campbell like the rest of us Campbells."
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <kaeleakae> Campbell McKenzie - the worst Campbell
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <fleshhy> Campbell is suspicious lol
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @JCVIM Jasper said he doesn't know where Chloe is, does Eva know, since she's her ghoul now?
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <ghosthack159> Only every time I look in the Mirror, Sir
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <jloxol> my names McKenzie
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> "Campbell 618 not acting right"
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <aechonex> wtf
[06/15/19, 3:41:21 PM] <Suedyin> @Spoiledchestnut although in a fire, synthetic is not fun
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> When does Jasper use guns?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <willsample> With all these Campbells, I'm beginning to suspect Victor thinks he's Andy Worhol.
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <prismaticfaerie> ....what the fuck
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <JCVIM> @lamiazenzibar who could say
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @Suedyin yeah, that is bad news bears
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <ghosthack159> @LamiaZenzibar technically Chloe is an unaligned Ghoul, according to Eva
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <bosmerian> campbell mckenzie smh
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <glasswalker80> Can these people just quit their day jobs and RP for our amusement full time?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> What, Jasper with a gun?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <superratlord> nelli is so dang beautiful I just can't get over it.

[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <jesusspicy> Gun?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <jamiadixon> Jasper about to go Sam Fisher.
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> ...Jasper... what?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <JackalopeLARP> "Send him to Nelli to be reclaimed. Deployed Campbell 619."
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <gundammac0311> 22 pistol with a silencer ;)
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> what's the BG tune BTW?
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <Softcastle_> He has people to frame. Unrelated.
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <aechonex> ugh that dress
[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <glasswalker80> I mean, they can sleep. I don't think I'm being unreasonable...

[06/15/19, 3:41:22 PM] <kaeleakae> I'll have a silenced pistol with quinoa on the side please
[06/15/19, 3:41:23 PM] <MissNayoung> Jasper would do well with a Welrod. That thing has a suppressor built into it.
[06/15/19, 3:41:23 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @Suedyin Then again, she has long, treated hair to get it that color. She was in for a bad time in case of fire anyway
[06/15/19, 3:41:23 PM] <Gamerprince333> the fact he asked for a gun is wow

[06/15/19, 3:41:24 PM] <Splattercatt> @Alexanderhero83 Traditional "death" = Torpor. Recoverable but bad. Final Death = Don't.

[06/15/19, 3:41:25 PM] <Nouralogical> what could possibly go wrong?
[06/15/19, 3:41:25 PM] <boldtSketches> @Alexanderhero83 If it happens, it happens. Jason confirmed in an interview or so, that it's possible for the characters to fall in Torpor or die if things go bad
[06/15/19, 3:41:25 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> VICTOR did you forget what Suzanne did to her?? geez
[06/15/19, 3:41:25 PM] <Corpsehandler> he's trying to provoke.....something.

[06/15/19, 3:41:25 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Annabelle asking the most obvious question.
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <MissNayoung> Really Victor? THat's like asking a crackhead to watch your valuables.
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <gundammac0311> are we sure Victor is not Malkavian? cause that's something my clan would do lol.
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <glasswalker80> That's the smartest damn thing Annabelle has ever said.
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <JackalopeLARP> "Because, Annabelle, here I have the flamethrower traps and the Rancor Pit."
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <Gamerprince333> nelli is still enthralled by suzy
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Cam isn't going to recognize his claim of Elysium

[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Did they announce any guests at the beginning?
[06/15/19, 3:41:26 PM] <Swoosh2355> Oh you invite the PRince, you invited his WHOLE court
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Victor really does need a Rancor Pit. And a pleasure barge.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <blind_eyes> BibleThump someones gonna die
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <kaeleakae> Diplomatic talks via gettin lit
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <prismaticfaerie> This won't end badly at all.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <gundammac0311> @prismaticfaerie probably take it as a insult.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <TheJerseyDriver> That actually makes sense. It won't WORK, but it makes sense.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <Corpsehandler> maybe jeanette!
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <B0sh1> You killed the herald, 0% chance of diplomacy.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <Metebelis777> but they will view it as accepting Cam rules
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <Akeluus> Big'ole gamble, Victor {:3
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <Corpsehandler> jeanette's fun.

[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Aggressive negotiations.
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <MissNayoung> So it's like Highlander. Sacred ground.

[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <Feor1300> @JackalopeLARP Maybe he could get Strikes a Chord to play the part of the Rancor. lol
[06/15/19, 3:41:27 PM] <ShadowScorpion> Doom flag waving around xD

[06/15/19, 3:41:28 PM] <Corpsehandler> oh no!
[06/15/19, 3:41:28 PM] <krazyflower> If the Cam accepts the offer of Elysium, it means that Victor can consider himself a prince. This will NOT END WELL.
[06/15/19, 3:41:28 PM] <WinterFaery84> A note was made!!!

[06/15/19, 3:41:28 PM] <JackalopeLARP> I'm rather thrilled those notes are going into the journal we made for Jason... I saw them.
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I don't believe Jasper has given his answer
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <kaeleakae> He replies "No"
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <nihilissa77> o.0
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <Pandaikon0980> This could go anywhere between okay and apocalyptic...
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <kira858> Yeah that's the thing, I give Victor major props for still trying diplomacy , he still has the bigger picture of the inquisition in his mind, with that said, I just can't see diplomacy working lol
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <Ziln00bas> it's not NOT Elysium
[06/15/19, 3:41:29 PM] <gundammac0311> lol

[06/15/19, 3:41:31 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Assuming Jasper doesn't already have a Mitnick-ed phone.
[06/15/19, 3:41:31 PM] <Davecom3> any club that would have X as a member is a club that X doesn't want to join.
[06/15/19, 3:41:31 PM] <karen86> @ziln00bas that's spot on!

[06/15/19, 3:41:33 PM] <highvoltage988> @thinbloodturnedventrue oh do you mean the player character? They must be somewhere since the events of the game are canon but unlikely they'll feature in the story since their background is player-dependant

[06/15/19, 3:42:11 PM] <Rhaitus> @glasswalker80 I agree, and one thing that everyone seems to have forgotten is that Victor worked out a tentative deal with Strikes a Chord. Dropping a lupine in say...Strauss' lair...now that is a power play.
[06/15/19, 3:42:11 PM] <WinterFaery84> @ghosthack159 Oh yea.

[06/15/19, 3:42:11 PM] <Corpsehandler> @BankyTheMachine he thinks this music is trash.
[06/15/19, 3:42:11 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Three seasons and no one but the Barons and the Camarilla have really taken issue with Victor‚Äôs social media usage. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right or even ok however it‚Äôs entirely possible that Victor knows something the rest of us don‚Äôt.

[06/15/19, 3:42:44 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @DemosthenesHPW Thank you again!
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <Gamerprince333> something bad is about to happen before or after break
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <willsample> true that. But Stayin' Alive is still the goal.
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <boldtSketches> @oldschoolboy2k His death kind of set her loyalties back in place
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <vcolev> disco disco
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <JackalopeLARP> VV is one of the most sympathetic vampires in Bloodlines. She never wants you to hurt anyone, and responds to being treated kindly.
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <Davecom3> is she trying to make Nelli jealous?
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @YokeThatOneBloke Currently being hunted, we think, by the Scourge, after the meeting with the Cot.
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <Chovexani> VV is an exotic dancer that never wears anything but lingerie?
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Jason does a good French accent
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <kingdannythewicked> murder on the dancefloor by sophie ellis bexter running through my mind about now
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <glasswalker80> Jason Carl killing it with the voices!
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @DemosthenesHPW Right on!
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Jason is SO ON POINT with the voices today. I mean, he always is, but many new voices today, impressive!
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> @Sketchblopp let's see, I'm not so sure
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <CypherOfTyr> Hullo friends!
[06/15/19, 3:42:45 PM] <GeekandSundry> Satine is off world traveling but she'll be back as Miranda in short order.

[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <highvoltage988> @GeekandSundry good to hear
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <RavenWolfe> yay love Satine
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <JackalopeLARP> VV owns a strip club in Bloodlines but she doesn't talk about her human past.

[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <aechonex> do we know hesha?
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <boldtSketches> I wish all the guest characters with actors would be in the studio but an RPG session with 8 or more players is usually either chaotic or leaves many players bored very often because they all get little attention
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <GeekandSundry> Hesha was another meeting from our session 0 between season game, he's part of the ministry
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <tommygunangels> wait whoah wtf Hesha?

[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <willsample> @aechonex he is the canonical signatue Setite
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <kaeleakae> It's surreal hearing one of my GM crushes imitate my OTHER GM crush xD
[06/15/19, 3:42:46 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> I was going to say, if a member of the Ministry tried to cut a party short for business, something is wrong. XD
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> If you play a Malkavian you find out VV's old name was Susan
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <Metebelis777> So victor needs a Tzi Vintner
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <Swoosh2355> he does that after the live steams.. uhhh
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <glasswalker80> @geekandsundry Would it be possible for Jason to do an ST chat or show of some kind. I take notes every time I watch, and I would love to know what goes on in his mind when he ST's. Maybe like a post-game chat about things that happen in the game and how he deals with them?
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <kira858> Jason Noo!! Don't curse him lol
[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <victor_neto> Hesha is the signature character for the Followers of Set aka Ministry

[06/15/19, 3:42:47 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Wait, was that Jason calling him out for his drink or providing vamp commentary? XD

[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <willsample> @glasswalker80 - they did a little pre-session thing to promote the show, including questions and prep for Jason, a couple of weeks ago. Its probably in the video archive
[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <Davecom3> more like beetle juice
[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Kharior lol

[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @DemosthenesHPW the curse of Caine is, "You will drink only blood, you will eat only ashes." And its described that mortal food and drink tastes like ash. Dirt wouldn't be far off.
[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Knowing is half the battle!
[06/15/19, 3:42:48 PM] <glasswalker80> @willsample Saw it, and it was great!

[06/15/19, 3:42:49 PM] <MissNayoung> Maybe this Stardust is Cody Rhodes?
[06/15/19, 3:42:49 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @JackalopeLARP Oh, I know, just Jason's tone struck me as "you are wrong about your drink choice" like a wine expert laying down a smackdown. :D

[06/15/19, 3:42:59 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I like to think that VV was supposed to be a strong character, but she was definitely also eye candy
[06/15/19, 3:42:59 PM] <ghosthack159> Matts are always so excited about DnD
[06/15/19, 3:42:59 PM] <aladenya> Ah ok

[06/15/19, 3:43:00 PM] <Your_Local_Doggo> makes me hurt inside how rough he is with it
[06/15/19, 3:43:00 PM] <glasswalker80> That guy is living the damned dream.
[06/15/19, 3:43:00 PM] <AlainaClaire> this is painful to watch

[06/15/19, 3:43:14 PM] <sgbee816> @chaoticloony I was telling a friend today that if Thirteen Ghosts had been made this year and not earlier, it would have been so much more successful. Not that it wasn't, just more

[06/15/19, 3:43:14 PM] <boldtSketches> Also.. As much as I love Jasper being private etc., I really wish what happened to Chloe would come up soon. It was a big thing and I would feel sad if this is going to be a (pun not intended) dead end. Like the stuff with Elenore.

[06/15/19, 3:43:36 PM] <krazyflower> Jasper has options. On one hand, he has his freedom and his friends. On the other, he gets to have a Lasombra on a leash. Tough choice.
[06/15/19, 3:43:36 PM] <pekoe212> He does everything dangerous alone ugh
[06/15/19, 3:43:36 PM] <winterwolftv> lol

[06/15/19, 3:43:37 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Alexanderhero83 No one, yet. Jasper was offered the position, but he hasn't accepted
[06/15/19, 3:43:37 PM] <boldtSketches> @krazyflower Right, that Lasombra kissed him, too. He is really good with the people. This emo-look seems to work.
[06/15/19, 3:43:37 PM] <WoodenMonkeyGod> Call Guiness
[06/15/19, 3:43:37 PM] <lexWOLFhale1> @Alexanderhero83 technically no one at the moment, Jasper has been offerd the job after killing the previous one

[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <Chovexani> Is Annabelle poly but committed to the triad?
[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <Metebelis777> well the not aging is nice..
[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <theafrochiapet> i'm asking for a friend
[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Slippery slope, Annabelle

[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <knightly2u> Geez Baby B. You can't just ask people if they LIKE being a Ghoul.
[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <Ziln00bas> seems very much like asking a slave what it's like being a Slave
[06/15/19, 3:43:44 PM] <krazyflower> I think Annabelle's preference is yes.
[06/15/19, 3:43:45 PM] <appu123y> the blood drop means ghoul or human?
[06/15/19, 3:43:45 PM] <Metebelis777> ex mil?

[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <knightly2u> @Ziln00bas Well to be frank, Annebelle isn't known for her tact.
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <itchstratch> The ghoul squad's dice rolls are generally really good
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <WoodenMonkeyGod> Push it right down
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <Akeluus> Chelsea happens to be quite good at most everything (read as great rolls to date)
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <WoodenMonkeyGod> straight down!
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <JRHiga> We dont know how old Chelsea is. Could be older than Annabelle.
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <Nouralogical> @prismaticfaerie you'll have to wait and see
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <Swoosh2355> Oo Belle's world is shook
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> ohhh
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <Aeriqui> Chelsea has always rolled great
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <Ziln00bas> @knightly2u for various reasons I love blunt/direct people.
[06/15/19, 3:43:47 PM] <glasswalker80> That's right! Shame her! Shame on you, Belle!

[06/15/19, 3:43:48 PM] <knightly2u> @glasswalker80 Sarcasm?

[06/15/19, 3:43:50 PM] <glasswalker80> @knightly2u A little. I keep waiting on the other shoe to drop with Annabelle. I think if there is one conflict I watch most keenly, it's to see how long Annabelle can twist becoming a monster like the rest.

[06/15/19, 3:43:52 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> Is he actually fading in and out?
[06/15/19, 3:43:53 PM] <appu123y> bryandOMG i forgot they made him transparent

[06/15/19, 3:43:53 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Oh, I'm sure Gary can definitely see Jasper. He's much older
[06/15/19, 3:43:54 PM] <kaeleakae> I love Jason's Gary voice

[06/15/19, 3:43:54 PM] <Akeluus> Jasper's "beast" reminds me of the little Black Blood Daemon inside of Soul in Soul Eater {:3
[06/15/19, 3:43:54 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> The past was changed Jasper is disappearing!
[06/15/19, 3:43:54 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> it's stuttering for me, gonna refresh.

[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <Wasp2374> Gary and Fiorenza are the best voices
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Jason is classy enough he could have laid down the Latin.
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <appu123y> i LOVE this voice
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <lexWOLFhale1> @Splattercatt hey, I'd do the same... xD
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <xv4ndalx> Effects on point!
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Fiorenza will always be my favorite voice.
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <Swoosh2355> Gary is Campbell!
[06/15/19, 3:43:55 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Si vis pacem, para bellum.

[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @MissKittyPower I just heard it in my head. XD
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Swoosh2355 maybe he's just one of them
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <RolePlayers> Nelli wearing a crown is such a mood
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <krazyflower> Jasper looks on jealously as he wants to learn that trick.
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <Akeluus> ... Gary... the head Nosferatu?
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <GeekandSundry> @RolePlayers it's ALL moods
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <PAPerryman> They should try... BackBlaze!
[06/15/19, 3:43:56 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I love that Power
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <itchstratch> @Akeluus yep
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Metebelis777> So potence monster check
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <RolePlayers> @GeekandSundry Yisss
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <lexWOLFhale1> Yes, Golden Nos Primogen in LA @Akeluus
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> No rats allowed Gary!
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @PAPerryman Only the best!
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <highvoltage988> @PAPerryman Mitnick and Yev would get along well
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> VICTOR DON'T INSULT HIS FOOD!
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <krazyflower> And DON'T invite Ramona to a Nos dinner party.
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Akeluus> Gary sounds like a slightly more subdued Florence ^w^
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <boldtSketches> @krazyflower Ohhh yes, this would be bad
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Vance1982> rat buffet

[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Yum? üê≠
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Swoosh2355> Everyone gets to visit Jaspers home
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <boldtSketches> The episode is surprisingly smooth
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> My only complaint for Gary's voice is that it should be a little more raspy, but that's hard to pull off without smoking or being Alex. :D
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <boldtSketches> like the calm before the storm
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <Nouralogical> @Ziln00bas lol YASS!!!
[06/15/19, 3:43:57 PM] <kaeleakae> Gary Fieri
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <itchstratch> Gary being polite
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Sketchblopp thank you
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <RolePlayers> This makes me miss the masquerade so much
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <pmatthew23> pmatthew23 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months!
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @pmatthew23
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Just... you know, the part you wish to see.
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <RolePlayers> Setite for life!
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> @Sketchblopp silky smooth!
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <knightly2u> @Nouralogical So When Jason approached you about playing Ib, how much leeway did he give you for character decisions?
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <boldtSketches> Waitwaitwait he *did* give the park to Gary?!
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <Metebelis777> thus the house of mirrors
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <Corpsehandler> @RolePlayers come back to the fold, you know you want to.
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <BurningHeat857> I got an understanding of Griffiths park last week. I learned that the path from the bottom to the observatory is doable but is quite a climb.
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Sketchblopp Just access
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <krazyflower> @Sketchblopp They have access to walk around.
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <Dragonchrome> Whom???
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <RolePlayers> @Corpsehandler I may have a thursday game coming up if my schedule allows it!
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <itchstratch> LUL Gary
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <fleshhy> He knows Eva
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <boldtSketches> @prismaticfaerie They just discovered leilines down there, access is already A LOT
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <aechonex> and gf
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <GeekandSundry> She is... not
[06/15/19, 3:43:58 PM] <Corpsehandler> oh ho ho, well done.
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <krazyflower> Yet.
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <TheArkade> I‚Äôm curious, how long has this session been going?
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <Swoosh2355> just keep giving him all the info for free Victor... yes...
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <crazyoddbaa> "She is not" what a tease!
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <tw1zt84> Victor is a skilled flatterer
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <MonkeyPrincess> I do enjoy scenes with Gary Golden

[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <Chovexani> Hmmm ... so suspicious I am so suspicious
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <thisjus10> @GeekandSundry can we bribe someone to fix that ? jcvimRaid
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <Rhaitus> That wording tho Alex...that is some Fey level phrasing
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Jasper is not happy
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <Dragonchrome> @TheArkade 2 hrs 15 mins
[06/15/19, 3:43:59 PM] <Onairic> I'm just so tickled with how he plays Gary, so charming but with an underlying intensity
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <CaptianTrips88> We enjoy your conversations too Gary :P
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Jason Carl working hard tonight with these voices
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <willsample> @TheArkade 2 hours and a bit
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <GeekandSundry> "as anyone would visit.. a park" is the weirdest loaded language ever
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <Splattercatt> @TheArkade 2 hurs 15 minutes
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <pekoe212> @Nouralogical hahah I can see that
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Gary would probably consider that a bonus. :D
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <andy_lnas> gandsAnnabella more like vamily member
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <RolePlayers> "careful advisement" hehehe
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Stay Golden!
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <knightly2u> Gary Golden is like the Fred Estair of VTM.
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <thisjus10> aka make eva a regular. jcvimLol
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @GeekandSundry Yeah,, that wasn't oddly specific or meant to close any loop holes at all
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @JCVIM You got some protection against Nos, gonna get a pretty powerful one to come for a visit
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <glasswalker80> Just rubber stamp Eva into the coterie already! We all want it! And obviously seating 5 is no problem!
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe
[06/15/19, 3:44:00 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @knightly2u Possibly literally. :D
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <krazyflower> I have a bad feeling about this....
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Jasper is grinding his teeth right now
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Acerbick> i love carls gary
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <GeekandSundry> @thisjus10 when the story moves we move with it, that's all we can do
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Aeriqui> does Eva have a coterie?
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Ziln00bas> @jcvim lurking silently...
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Swoosh2355> Only if Jasper asks her on an Official date.. LOL
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <boldtSketches> @JCVIM Seems like Eva should invest a bit more blood in some extra warding
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <LordSauro> We need Eva in the coterie!
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Vance1982> why do i get the feeling his majesty is gonna show up
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Can I just say, I'm surprised the club is still standing at this point.
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <thisjus10> right @glasswalker80 jcvimHearts jcvimHype
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Ziln00bas> @aeriqui she's always come off as an independent
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <knightly2u> @DemosthenesHPW This would explain ALOT actually.. (Don't know much Gary lore, but I know my Estair)
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Corpsehandler> you have to have the verbal tactics of the fey (or a D&D devil) to get along among the kindred.
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <complainthat> @aeriqui no? weird sisters?
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <TheGreenman> I think Eva has her own coterie
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> This music kind of reminds of "Nasty Girl" by Vanity
[06/15/19, 3:44:01 PM] <prismaticfaerie> This has been an oddly subdued episode... Expecting a bomb to drop literally any minute
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <willsample> Given Jasper's flirting, a warded codpiece seems in order.
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <pekoe212> @DemosthenesHPW Yeah no fire, weird
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <BurningHeat857> I think I missed a couple episodes. What's the status of Becca Scott's character?
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <Swoosh2355> We need all the vamps in the coterie, so that there is a bigger coterie than there is Campbells
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <itchstratch> ooh
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Uh oh...
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <Shadowsoflife> The weird sisters maybe @Aeriqui
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <appu123y> MY SPIDEY SENSES ARE TINGLING
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <GeekandSundry> @prismaticfaerie we are like the tides
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <boldtSketches> This evening was waaayy too smooth to not end with a cliffhanger
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <Somberlain> oh boy
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <thisjus10> @BurningHeat857 she's Eva's Ghoul
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <Chovexani> I feel like Eva has the park totally tricked out, especially after what she and Jasper learned.
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <Dragonchrome> spidey senses are tingling
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <geminichild34> @BurningHeat857 Jasper says she ran off but we don't know if it is a lie or not
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <glasswalker80> @thisjus10 Or maybe that might ruin the Jeva vibe? Like too much of a good thing?
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <thisjus10> @BurningHeat857 as far as we know
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @knightly2u He was an actor back during the silent film into tap era. he's a cleopatra, we think,embraced to make his star fade into ugliness.
[06/15/19, 3:44:02 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @BurningHeat857 Nothing new about Chloe since the season 2 epilogues

[06/15/19, 3:44:04 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @knightly2u Like, he's a bit of showman. When you first meet him in Bloodlines, he pretends to be your consconience... full tux without the jacket though.
[06/15/19, 3:44:04 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> Haha
[06/15/19, 3:44:04 PM] <Splattercatt> I had to move to the side because Jasper was staring a hole through me...

[06/15/19, 3:44:26 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas USUALLY yes. Princes are supposed to be adjudicators of the law. Ignoring the FIRST LAW, usually a bad idea for them.

[06/15/19, 3:44:26 PM] <karen86> @knightly2u all the more hilarious cx
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas Now, most other traditions are a little more lax, but the Tower is PRETTY BIG on the first, so dropping the Masq is a pretty big deal.
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <GeekandSundry> @philbe63 maybe he is
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @pepsi_chola Some of them, yes
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <krazyflower> Vannevar has definitely *streeccccchhed* some rules.

[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <lexclesti> for some reason I thought the Lasombra was Lucita?
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <krazyflower> EIGHT!?!?
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <winterwolftv> The logic.
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <pepsi_chola> what kind of vampires are the five of them?
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <GeekandSundry> Victor has been listening to Archangel
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <boldtSketches> I wonder whether the scurges do know that Bloodstone ritual. V5 says it's something the Camarilla likes to use to compensate the lack of tracking technology
[06/15/19, 3:44:27 PM] <LuciferJD> Ok so we are waiting for blood on the dance floor to start to play Kappa

[06/15/19, 3:44:29 PM] <boldtSketches> For just having lost your club and preparing the new one for fortress battles, they are really sloppy with handeling that towards their guests. I mean, you can never really trust your enemies. (And especially not guys like Sanchez etc.)
[06/15/19, 3:44:29 PM] <aechonex> @ladyblogging lol
[06/15/19, 3:44:29 PM] <boldtSketches> @Aeriqui 3 I think
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas Above the princes would be the Justicars, then the Inner Circle who rules the entirety of the Cam.
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <philbe63> Ok, someone needs to write a song about Lasombra to the La Bamba tune
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <willsample> She's a ghoul @pepsi_chola
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> !points @spoiledchestnut
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Zaecus> @pepsi_chola Chelsea is NElli's ghoul
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @pepsi_chola She is a ghoul, basically bound to Nelli to protect her during the day and run security and recon
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> oh, I thought it was a point checker
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Ossborn> @pepsi_chola Jasper = Nosferatu, Annabelle= Brujah, Nelli = Toreador, Victor = Ventrue. Chelsea is a ghoul
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Ziln00bas> @demostheneshpw I think Justicars were mentioned as Nuclear Bombs?
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Swoosh2355> Rodrigo the Tzimisce
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <crusaderbro> another lasombra
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> OHHH
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Onairic> ?!
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Ellie181> This guy is gonna end up being Tzimisce with the coteries luck
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Jasper NO!
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <crazyoddbaa> Good to know the clan bane is still the same. Means i still can't get into a cab :-p
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas They mentioned that, but I think they were referring to the Justicar's enforcers... basically the Justicar's sheriffs... which are the Archons.
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <ladyblogging> o h n o
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <itchstratch> intimidation check Jasper... wait
[06/15/19, 3:44:30 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> @pepsi_chola If you haven't seen from the beginning and are just jumping in you can watch the first two seasons and some of the epilogues before season 3 (this) on youtube
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Ziln00bas> @demostheneshpw ah okay
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Onairic> oh god it's about to go down, folks
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <philbe63> Dance....Casual...
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas Like the Justicars order the Archons, so the Justicars being AROUND is NOT GOOD... and they're certainly very powerful too... but the Archons are generally "the bombs".
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Vance1982> justicar's are super bad news
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <krazyflower> So to recap: Vannevar has allowed powers and domination at Elysium, directly attempted to kill kindred without cause or declaring it, infringing on claimed territory, what else?
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> RIP, another club burns!
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <prismaticfaerie> This is an interesting way to fight lol
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Akeluus> Watch her *crush* it again
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <RavenWolfe> pretty good at that

[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <CaptianTrips88> "a little worse than not bad"
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Zaecus> When you roll good dice, you don't need great skills.

[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <PhantomofTruth> Being a Ventrue, @krazyflower
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <boldtSketches> Ain't it with Scourges usually like with Naga, those were-snakes? When you're seeing them, you're dead 5 minutes later?
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <BelgiumTV> holding close annabelle clearly inside the Circle
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <Chovexani> Is that due to the ghouling blood attracting mortals?
[06/15/19, 3:44:31 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @krazyflower So breaking just about every tradition except the first seeing as how he didn't really do hospitality/domain upon arrival in the city either, so far as we know.
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <BelgiumTV> whispering please do not let me go
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <itchstratch> stare off!

[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> I need this soundtrack for my own parties
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <nihilissa77> yeess dance off!!
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Dancing with the Stars , folks!
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <boldtSketches> Does this tactic count as a cold war if it includes hot dancing?
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <Ziln00bas> @demostheneshpw I wonder if a Prince neglecting the Masquerade is more likely to get dealt from within his own Praxis or from above
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> Hope it's not this Rodrigo https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Roderigo_al-Dakhil
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <willsample> Sharks and Jets...
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> No presenting himself to Abrams, Therese, Nines, etc..., though that one was probably smart, he'd likely be ashes if he went into Nines's bar if Damsel was home.
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <theafrochiapet> are we going to do a zoolander walk-off?
[06/15/19, 3:44:32 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> O_o
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <RecorderEvans> @kingdannythewicked Banu Haqim and Assamite are the same thing. Assamite is just a demeaning term to call a Banu Haqim. =D
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <JRHiga> Someone bout to get served!
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <krazyflower> @DemosthenesHPW Good point.
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Ziln00bas If word got back to someone higher up, he could face some pressure from the Justicars.
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <aechonex> welp that was a nice club
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Don't think she cares, Neill

[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <boldtSketches> @Ronin_LXXIII Let's hope it's not..
[06/15/19, 3:44:33 PM] <kingdannythewicked> I know, some people are abit old school and only remember the assamites while banu haquim are a new fangled name

[06/15/19, 3:44:37 PM] <willsample> at least the 'everything's fine' fire would help....
[06/15/19, 3:44:37 PM] <Splattercatt> @Durandal2100 Traditionally the coterie's safeowrd is onomatopoeia representing a massacre and a building collapsing....
[06/15/19, 3:44:37 PM] <boldtSketches> @Swoosh2355 It's not an official Elysium, so they can also just start an epic dicipline magic fight

[06/15/19, 3:44:39 PM] <willsample> Miranda is willing to let them fight to the last drop of their blood, willing to let them all lay down their lives, while she takes a powder. Go Ministry!
[06/15/19, 3:44:39 PM] <Chovexani> teeheehee
