[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Ossborn> The music is pretty low
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <MrNY2Cali> i'm on headphones I can hear everything fine
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Blackjungle308> (But yeah. A little louder would be nice. )

[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <ghosthack159> You're not Zelda... you're the character from the Necrodancer, transported into Hyrule
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Blackjungle308> "zelda AND sheik". And me myself and Irene? Kappa
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Shadowner> their name is cadence

[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <ghosthack159> Necrodancer is the bad guy
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <ghosthack159> @Zismarith it's like... a pun
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Blackjungle308> Cadence is how a music flows. (Lets confuse them, guys. Kappa )
[06/19/19, 11:40:57 AM] <Zismarith> Yeah.

[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <ghosthack159> Zelda's face is priceless
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <Blackjungle308> Guys.. When enimies are around, EVERYTHING has to be on the beat. Moving, attacking, items, etc. :)
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <ghosthack159> Three Vikings Shout out!
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <chaoticloony> Don't try these things at home, these are trained professionals! :)
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <Blackjungle308> And the beat is TWICE the bpm you were saying "beat, beat, beat" to. :D
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <ghosthack159> i need a Necrodancer level added to smash
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <Leigh574> Hey Everyone TwitchUnity
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <Zismarith> Gamers through the ages have wondered, "does Zelda have rhythm?"
[06/19/19, 11:40:58 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Leigh574
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Leigh574> hey @chaoticloony

[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Leigh574> Hey @Ossborn @JeffM0307
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <chaoticloony> Hehhehehheheh
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Yes it‚Äôs a Zelda game with rogue like elements. Dungeon layout is randomized and over world map is randomized.
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Zismarith> Ah, the Castle music from A Link to the Past. Sweet.
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Danoba> How's audio now?
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> I really love the boss music in this.
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Zismarith> I wouldn't change it.
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Much better @danoba
[06/19/19, 11:40:59 AM] <Danoba> Works for me, thanks for the input everyone.

[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> This is actually a more forgiving game than Necrodancer
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Yes headphones help

[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> @the_tboyce eogHey
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <The_TBoyce> So how does this game work? You have to time the button presses?
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <chaoticloony> At least it doesn't have permadeath
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <ghosthack159> Think..... music beat matching game
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> @the_tboyce You move and attack to the beat when there are enemies. Otherwise it plays like Zelda.
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <ghosthack159> except ALL your actions and movements need to be done "on the beat"
[06/19/19, 11:41:00 AM] <chaoticloony> I believe in you all!
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Overworked and dungeon layouts are randomized each playthrough.
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> *overworld
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <The_TBoyce> @AxisOfAnarchy If you say so. I've never played a Zelda game, so I have to assume the mechanics *are* the same. :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Zelda is an RPG with puzzle elements
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> If that helps.
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <chaoticloony> This is a Killer game!
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <The_TBoyce> @AxisOfAnarchy I've heard of Zelda, I've just never played it myself. But thank you, though. :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> No problem. I play both games that this crosses so I try to help!
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <chaoticloony> I played the original Zelda, and i didn't find it very fun and haven't played any since
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <ghosthack159> I mean... Ocarina of time
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> I‚Äôve been playing Necrodancer since early access. My first Zelda game was Link‚Äôs Awakening .
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <The_TBoyce> I got relatively late into video games, so I wasn't playing video games when I would have been in the Zelda age group.
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Link‚Äôs Awakening is a good starter.
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <Zismarith> Not sure I'd call it an RPG.
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <Ossborn> Zelda- A Link To The Past was my first one, back on the Super Nintendo
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <ghosthack159> eh, Tboyce.... it's not really an "age group" sort of thing... it's decidedly not a "kids game"
[06/19/19, 11:41:01 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Why not? You level up via hearts and gather items.
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 Oh, interesting. There goes one assumption I had about Legend of Zelda. :)
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <ghosthack159> no suggestions for Wand of Gamelon, eh?
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <chaoticloony> FTL is probably my favorite Roguelike
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <The_TBoyce> One game I really thought about playing because it looked a bit darker was "Twilight Princess"? Any thoughts on that game?
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <Ossborn> FTL... I never managed to beat it.... nowadays I play a lot Dead Cells
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <ghosthack159> granted, @The_TBoyce it's not a 'gritty ADULT game", but it's not "for kids".... in the same way that Mario games are not "kids" games.
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce Twilight princess is a solid choice.
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <Zismarith> @AxisOfAnarchy Hmm. 50/50 on the non-traditional leveling. Real time combat. But mostly that Link doesn't really change throughout the game, or even the series. No character . . . anything.
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> I need to start a 2nd playthrough.
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <FuffyButt> you did it
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <chaoticloony> @Ossborn I beat it a couple of times, and it was so enjoyable but i played it probably 500 times
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <The_TBoyce> Oh, Khail...that hits too close to home. :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:02 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Character development is a very recent phenomenon in RPGs. The original FF had no character development, same with Dragon Warrior.
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <Zismarith> That is true.
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <chaoticloony> I also enjoyed the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games and Angband with its so many versions
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <The_TBoyce> I wonder if people who are really good at BeatSaber would be just as good at this game?
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Lost Woods theme eogAhh
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <ghosthack159> ask Erika ;P :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <AxisOfAnarchy> Not my top fave track but a great one nonetheless

[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 LOL, it me, but with Axis & Allies. :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce have you tried the A&A&Zombies?
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <The_TBoyce> "You did it." - the Internet's dad
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <FuffyButt> you have accomplished so much.
[06/19/19, 11:41:03 AM] <FuffyButt> i am very proud
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 No, but I've heard of it. Truth be told, I've been brainstorming a World War Z-style D&D campaign.
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <ghosthack159> I've been trying to construct a contemporary setting for DnD... where you could have a zombie apocalypse due to necromancers
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <The_TBoyce> "We were making headway." But how much does a headway?
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <chaoticloony> !points @The_TBoyce
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, @The_TBoyce! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 85 points!
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <ghosthack159> about 4 lpbs
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <ghosthack159> lbs
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 Basically. Necromancers would have so much fun in World War Z. "Yay! More thralls!" :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:04 AM] <The_TBoyce> Do you lose health if you miss a beat? What are the consequences?
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <„Ç®„ÇØ„Çª„É´> You just don't get to move
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> I donno why, but in my head canon... Necromancers are like... the D-students at wizard school.... that's why they always run-amok and why it always "goes wrong"..... only chump wizards try to raise the dead.
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> :P
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> @„Ç®„ÇØ„Çª„É´ Okay, so it's like, "paralyzed for a turn", basically? So the enemy has a chance to attack or move?
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <„Ç®„ÇØ„Çª„É´> There's also a mode that turns of the rhythm part and just makes it a old-school rogue movement, where everything just waits for you to move
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce yeah, sort of... think of it more like.... a turn based game, but the turns are the beat
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 Hey! Saruman dabbled in the fell arts of the Dark Lord, and he was called "the Wise"! :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> @ghosthack159 Right, a turn-based game.
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> yeah, right up until he fell... then he became... Le Chump
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> Dang it, now I want a pretzel...
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> Hot take, Pretzel rolls are over rated..... Soft Pretzels are amazing though
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> Yes, we know what a pretzel bun looks like...
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <The_TBoyce> OMG, King's Hawaiian is the best!
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> Sour Dough is amazing.... PBnJ on sourdough toast.... Clam chowder in a sour dough bowl.... crutons....
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <„Ç®„ÇØ„Çª„É´> It's because of the salt...
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> Definitely eaten playdough
[06/19/19, 11:41:05 AM] <ghosthack159> and elmer's glue
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <The_TBoyce> Sourdough is so good. Cuban bread is good, as is focaccia, rye, and French.
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <FuffyButt> i have made plado
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <JeffM0307> Yeaaaaaaah! XD
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <chaoticloony> I was more of a paste fan, great minty taste, also the smell of fresh sheets from the Ditto machine
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce ..... do you like....bread? I've got a french loaf! *booff*.. goood byyyyy......
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <The_TBoyce> I doubt I have ever eaten Play-Dough. I can remember everything up to age 2, and no Play-Dough eating.
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <ghosthack159> *whisper calls* I love you.....
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <Mattybot3000> I've sniffed playdough.
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <Zismarith> ^ Heh
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <ghosthack159> Yeah, you don't need play dough, to make cookies...... you can just use real dough
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <The_TBoyce> You can make cookies in the shape of giraffes or really any animal.
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <ghosthack159> let them play with cookie dough
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <FuffyButt> good job
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <chaoticloony> Great job!
[06/19/19, 11:41:06 AM] <ghosthack159> pretty sure we're all fine with that...
[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> "You did it." We really need an emote of Khail saying that. :D
[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <Mattybot3000> haha yes! I was always jealous of my friend that had the playdough masher toy thing.
[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <PSWii2008> I forgot this was on, but I'm here now!

[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <FuffyButt> i had Legos, they tasted terrible
[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <ghosthack159> OK, so realness...... why do they make fruit flavored permanent markers?
[06/19/19, 11:41:07 AM] <The_TBoyce> Alright, I've got to head over to the gym. Thanks for the stream, Khail, Erika, and Markeia!

[06/19/19, 11:41:08 AM] <Mattybot3000> OMG I saw a recipe for slime pizza on good mthyical morning. It looked disgusting. lol
[06/19/19, 11:41:08 AM] <Shadowner> gak was toxic when it got warm
[06/19/19, 11:41:08 AM] <ghosthack159> @The_TBoyce Later TB.. probably see you here or STS later

[06/19/19, 11:41:16 AM] <Zismarith> @MissNayoung I read an article to that effect, but I heard something somewhat different.

[06/19/19, 11:41:16 AM] <MissNayoung> @Zismarith Same here. I've heard various people say they heard something different each time.
[06/19/19, 11:41:16 AM] <ghosthack159> anyone who plays the necrodancer games.... do you have to press something to "stay on the beat" if you aren't moving?
[06/19/19, 11:41:16 AM] <Ossborn> Okay, given that I am dogsitting again, and it¬¥s 2.30 AM, I¬¥m calling it a night, guess the dog will wake me up quite early.... Bye all!

[06/19/19, 11:41:16 AM] <mastimo> oh my god I love this
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <ghosthack159> right right... I just know that you might want some timing adjustments to their patterns. wasn't sure if you could "mess up the beat" if you just stood still
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <darkofnate> I have no idea what's going on in the game, but I'm loving the music.
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <ghosthack159> Push it in front of the stairs
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <derekleeketchum> @darkofnate you basically time your actions and movements to the beat of the music playing
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <MissNayoung> THis makes me wish for a Hyrule LEgends sequel with Cadence from NEcrodancer as a playable character. I'd also want more obscure Zelda characters in it such as Veran and Onox from Oracle Of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <MissNayoung> I should say Hyrule Warriors.
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <Grigxen> a new Hyrule Warriors game would be cool; i got the switch release of it last year and it was fun
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <ghosthack159> I got you <3
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <ArisBranwin> I like Hyrule Warriors.. I just need $$$ for the switch version.
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <FuffyButt> !whodat

[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <ArisBranwin> Yeah and people have beaten it in a week.
[06/19/19, 11:41:17 AM] <Zismarith> @MissNayoung The reversal I head seems to say "Oh Zelda, oh please find the bodies." Also some folks examined the symbols on the walls and the green smoke and lined them up with the Gerudo language.
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <Grigxen> did anyone play the Fire Emblem musou game on the switch that came out like a year ago? it seems like nobody has made a musou game that fully utilizes current gen, as far as graphics and engine power goes
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <Shadowner> ruined
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <MissNayoung> @Zismarith I've also seen some folks bring up the Twili tribe from Twilight Princess. More specifically Zant.

[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <FuffyButt> can you blow up the spikes
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <Shadowner> you need the left 2 in position
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <darkofnate> Said EVERY RPG character Markeia's ever played...
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <paynekilr> You need the power glove
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <LytolFrost> can you stack the cubes?
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <iceblades06> lol it is a real Loz thing
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <Shadowner> one in that gap, one below the grey to stack from 1 behind the grey
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <paynekilr> Like items you havent unlocked
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <Grigxen> things cant be pulled can they?
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <MissNayoung> The Power Glove is an actual item in Zelda games. Neat item too.
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <iceblades06> ohm shimmy it?
[06/19/19, 11:41:18 AM] <ghosthack159> ...... are we not doing phrasing?

[06/19/19, 11:41:19 AM] <TheJerseyDriver> (We've never done phrasing here.)
[06/19/19, 11:41:19 AM] <darkofnate> SO. MUCH. PHRASING.
[06/19/19, 11:41:19 AM] <ghosthack159> It just needs to go in front of the chest
[06/19/19, 11:41:19 AM] <payne1221> man down

[06/19/19, 11:41:19 AM] <Lh_sabre> All the phrasing plus all the character exertion sounds while I‚Äôm not watching is quite the experience

[06/19/19, 11:41:20 AM] <FuffyButt> next time put it in the slot
[06/19/19, 11:41:20 AM] <Shadowner> the step needed to be in front

[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <Shadowner> now you at least know how to do the stack up puzzle
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <payne1221> hooray
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <nickraska> LOL all that for a Glass prefix
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <darkofnate> The real treasure is the aggravation we made along the way.
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <Critternation3000> steebzOuch reaction
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <ghosthack159> "I'm gonna go instantly break this thing we worked so hard to get"
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <Zismarith> @MissNayoung Okay, I've read an article with what you were saying about Zant. It's all lining up.
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <momanonymous> Good job!

[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <Shadowner> blue butterfly
[06/19/19, 11:41:21 AM] <MissNayoung> @Zismarith I know! It would be interesting to see the Twili again and Zant would be the most logical choice.
[06/19/19, 11:41:22 AM] <Shadowner> dig?
[06/19/19, 11:41:22 AM] <Critternation3000> now this is shovel knights
[06/19/19, 11:41:22 AM] <iampuddleglum> I can't play this game because I don't have a Switch (someday...), but I am loving the gameplay of this game that I've seen so far

[06/19/19, 11:41:22 AM] <nickraska> I love that Beetle is played off as a "dung" beetle with the sprite work xD
