[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I have a taste for danger. To everyone I stay a stranger
[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <bloodmage720> jets
[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <dragonnzelda> Chloe that's it haha, couldn't remember the character name
[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <vcolev> sacha vykos!!!!! please!!!
[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <ivanrollit> @DemosthenesHPW that's fair, I guess I convinced myself it was someone we had already met in this chronicle
[06/22/19, 2:11:16 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I love sharks :)
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <KBTibbs> But how would Chloe get this information?
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <pretty_empic> I don’t think we know her yet...
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <LunarLorkhan> isn't shark week soon?? lol
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Chloe would make sense, but I don't think that sounds like Becca? Unless she's better at changing her voice than I give her credit for.
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <sin_x911> well damn
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <kaeleakae> Sharks... why did it have to be sharks...
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Swoosh2355> She just tipped off the Inquisition if they are listening
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Swimming with the Sharks: No Rokea were hurt in the making of this episode ^_^;;;
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <xo_girlwonder> *jaws theme*
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <JadeHawk0920> who's josh summer? the guest he was talking about?
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Cage in the water...Sharks in the water... YOU"RE in the water...
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Dame_90> Sharks roll with the fishes
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Onairic> hmm, an emphasis on asking questions, from archangel. Interesting
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <TheGreenman> oh and there's usually a lot of blood
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <tw1zt84> Lets tell a vampire story!
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Jimersion> INTRO
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Suedyin> I think Chloe was studying journalism? iirc?
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <LunarLorkhan> Sharks are friends
[06/22/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Swoosh2355> We're gonna need a bigger boat
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <Somberlain> uh oh
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Explosions?!
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <superratlord> I have thalassophobia so no shark love here
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @ivanrollit I'm hoping Deb got turned at some point. :D
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <PAPerryman> @LamiaZenzibar You should then give her more credit
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <aechonex> pumped!
[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <CainTheConfused> And me without my shark repellent. Alas.

[06/22/19, 2:11:18 PM] <Corpsehandler> problem is, we're all the fish in this equation.

[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <zodiacleopard> Archangel's voice has bits that sound like Fiona, and some that sound like Chole, sooo
[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <Dragonchrome> it has begun

[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <shanearthur1> Looking forward to this!
[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @Corpsehandler I mean, some sharks eat other sharks. That lady shark at some aquarium ate a male shark because he kept bumping into her. :D
[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Oh boy we’re doing this
[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <webbyghost> Archangel makes me even more hype than usual
[06/22/19, 2:11:19 PM] <WarpedSpirit> I love the music they play

[06/22/19, 2:11:20 PM] <ivanrollit> I don't think Chloe would have enough information this early into her time as (an inderect) part of Kindred society to make those broadcasts
[06/22/19, 2:11:20 PM] <PAPerryman> So am I @JCVIM

[06/22/19, 2:12:04 PM] <twitchcraft36> I thought the beast is like their primordial hunger, but does it always manifest as an inner voice or alternate personality?

[06/22/19, 2:12:07 PM] <willsample> Or is it 'Nobody puts Baby B in a corner'?

[06/22/19, 2:12:17 PM] <ThunderZero> Eva: Who's shadow is this?

[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <twitchcraft36> What's jasper got that I don't lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <Akeluus> Jasper does not go on dates. He only has "business meetings"
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <ivanrollit> iTs NoT a DaTe

[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <mithrilmist> That is definitely not a date...and we don't mean not a date like the not a date with Eva
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <themerybiscuiteer> As quick as god damn possible
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <Jmaniac86> Jasper proving that it really IS all about personality
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <nerdypatty> I feel like he has a plan
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> It's a date with the Reaper and a Lasombra is not going back to tell any tales
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <the_wizard_of_disaster> Eva not happy
[06/22/19, 2:12:18 PM] <pulsarone> that was a esay secret

[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <KBTibbs> @JCVIM IT SOME BS, THATS WHAT
[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <Suedyin> remember chat: There is no guarantee Jasper is telling Aurora the truth. Wait and see what he actually does.
[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @JCVIM I believe Jasper is flirting his ass off
[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <GryphonCompanion> <3
[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <BuffaloVal> Who does Aurora work for? I missed that.
[06/22/19, 2:12:19 PM] <Swoosh2355> Eva has made an Angry Note

[06/22/19, 2:12:20 PM] <tw1zt84> i wish i could see those blueprints Jasper has
[06/22/19, 2:12:20 PM] <willsample> Aurora is the scourge of the Prince of LA Vandevar, iirc

[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <GryphonCompanion> :)
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <Hellhound732> Is jasper still the sheriff? I missed a few episodes I think
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <RecorderEvans> @JCVIM D:
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <Lordofdragons073> Eva is going to BBQ Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <twitchcraft36> @DemosthenesHPW thanks I also find it interesting that for a disfigured nosferatu, jasper is extermely charming like a toreador lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <kukubee> hahaha @JCVIM
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <ivanrollit> eva has had it OFFICIALLY

[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @ JCVIM lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:21 PM] <philbe63> Eva is taking off all her finery....To go 'chat' with Aurora
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <webbyghost> Jasper is the scourge of the dating scene lmao
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Jasper leaves the dancefloor moonwalking
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <Dragonchrome> #ITrustJasper
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <GeekandSundry> That blood is a bit of a thing... careful ghouls
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> I wanna see Eva show up at the club
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> No! Bad Mark!
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> @jcvim i'm betting that jasper is trying to get to Strauss
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <tw1zt84> nope
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <ivanrollit> @Hellhound732 i believe he still has to give a final answer to the prince
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <ZalgoVonKugelblitz> Nosferatu Bestferatu
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <LunarLorkhan> F

[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <BuffaloVal> Thx @willsample
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> @jcvim he’s only 5. Just give him some corner time. He will learn
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <karen86> @dragonchrome seconded!
[06/22/19, 2:12:22 PM] <Nightbot> @jesusspicy -> ONLY HULK CAPSLOCKS [warning]
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <willsample> Jasper may lose his semi-precious stones.
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <ThunderZero> wow this is such a great social encounter tho
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <Suedyin> @Lordofdragons073 although I would have thought Eva would appreciate strategy, and the difference between seeming and being
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <nerdypatty> I knew this was a bad idea to ghoul him NotLikeThis
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <chaeon1974> What are Anarch sheriffs called?
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <Swoosh2355> just walk in and like boil blood to both Lasombra.. poof ash
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <KBTibbs> Jasper seduces everyone with his awkwardness. If only he had his BOWTIE!
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <GeekandSundry> Way to go Nelli!
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @chaeon1974 Jaspers
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <MissNayoung> He's like a drug addict in that aspect. Only blood won't make him steal a tv and then jump out a 2nd story window to escape the irate owners.
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <twitchcraft36> The fact that a ghoul can get dangerously jealous like a rabid dog might be a hint to annabelle this is a bad idea :)
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <Akeluus> Jasper Moonwalks into the shadows, grin slowly fading last
[06/22/19, 2:12:23 PM] <philbe63> And we still don't know where Eleanor is or what Annabelle did with her, right?
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <Onairic> Nelli is THE clutch player, every damn time!
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <MissNayoung> Nice save Nelli.
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Akeluus I'd like to see that as an animation
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Suedyin I'm just saying from what we saw so far
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <Rats808> @chaeon1974 closest they have is a Sweeper; their job is to take out any Kindred that the Baron indicates or that are actively threatening the domain, iirc
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <chaeon1974> @yokethatonebloke Touche! (;
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> @jcvim 5 years embraced that is

[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <Akeluus> @Geek&Sundry a gif of that would virally break the internet, I think ^^

[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Mark is going to kick ass
[06/22/19, 2:12:24 PM] <aechonex> is anyone else getting some weird pauses?

[06/22/19, 2:12:25 PM] <kaeleakae> What a story Mark
[06/22/19, 2:12:25 PM] <superratlord> that snort says all
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Darzog67> lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <kira858> what?!
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <aechonex> OK not just me
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <poettwist> Do not ever let Wil Wheaton near any of those dice.
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Suedyin> @Lordofdragons073 remember that Jasper had to be sufficiently convincing to fool Aurora
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <willsample> Its not a party until we light the Jasper scented candle.
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> How dare!
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @willsample Too soon
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Poor Mark getting mind-gamed

[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Suedyin Oh I know!

[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Akeluus> 'Belle just needs to go ahead and upgrade Mark so he at least has a little more autonomy {:'
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <willsample> @YokeThatOneBloke if we have to wait for Jasper to go more than 2 sessions without being burned, it will always be too soon
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Suedyin> well said whomever remarked ghouling him was a bad idea
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Mark is gonna have brain damage before this story is done!
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Darzog67> lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @willsample Good point lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:26 PM] <KBTibbs> YEs. The word is talking

[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <twitchcraft36> I'm surprised suzanne/roxeanne hasn't shown up, her love spell seems to be so strongly ingrained in nellie still
[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> "talking" thats what Jasper is gonna claim was all that was going on too...
[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I love how Nelli calls everyone "you kids" when she's not THAT old lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> !itsfine
[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <Nightbot> We're fine. We're all fine here now, thank you. Uh, how are you?
[06/22/19, 2:12:27 PM] <willsample> This entire conversation led to the worst mental picture of Jasper singing 'Fever' to Eva.
[06/22/19, 2:12:28 PM] <PAPerryman> Kids don't "talk." They "Text"
[06/22/19, 2:12:28 PM] <mariacomet> ut oh
[06/22/19, 2:12:28 PM] <MissNayoung> I don't blame Mark. If he loses control then this will get extremely messy.
[06/22/19, 2:12:28 PM] <RavenWolfe> oh noooo

[06/22/19, 2:12:33 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. The Club Maharani gala opening is threatened by gatecrashers. The coterie must cope with the intrusion without destroying the Masquerade.
[06/22/19, 2:12:33 PM] <Dragonchrome> !roleplay
[06/22/19, 2:12:34 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <Swoosh2355> Lasombra are part of the cam now, V5 Sabbat is gone for the most part
[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <willsample> @YokeThatOneBloke - not all, no
[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <Metebelis777> or vauldarie at least
[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <twitchcraft36> I'm surprised I haven't seen smedi tzimice or giovanni yet

[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <ivanrollit> @YokeThatOneBloke the sabbat sometimes pushes for diablerie of sires/elders when the time comes
[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <LunarLorkhan> they're not gone, just away
[06/22/19, 2:12:46 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> @YokeThatOneBloke Tzimisce commit diablerie more often

[06/22/19, 2:12:47 PM] <ivanrollit> @YokeThatOneBloke as stated in one of the previous episodes, the lasombra wanting to join the cam have to provide a sacrifice, which is why rodrigo said he had to sacrifice "that which he loved"
[06/22/19, 2:12:47 PM] <ivanrollit> correct me if im wrong though
[06/22/19, 2:12:47 PM] <Akeluus> Victor can manipulate the battlefield. That's his primary magics
[06/22/19, 2:12:47 PM] <Suedyin> indeed @Metebelis777 , vaulderie, although v5 lore may differ from previous worlds

[06/22/19, 2:12:49 PM] <zodiacleopard> Aurora Knows that now
[06/22/19, 2:12:49 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> I wonder if that was an overhear roll

[06/22/19, 2:12:50 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Does Mark know who Jasper is?
[06/22/19, 2:12:50 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> I bet Gary knows at the very least
[06/22/19, 2:12:50 PM] <nerdypatty> Jasper is like who dis?? lol
[06/22/19, 2:12:50 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Also I think Jasper could guess that that's Mark
[06/22/19, 2:12:51 PM] <jamiadixon> Jason rolled to see if Aurora heard him I'd bet the bank on it.
[06/22/19, 2:12:51 PM] <Suedyin> "he's my Dad"... if someone doesn't think that is complicated, maybe they haven't been a son? <wry grin>
[06/22/19, 2:12:51 PM] <SiderealEX> There wasn't an antedeluvian in the coffin. It was a red herring.
[06/22/19, 2:12:51 PM] <RavenWolfe> when is it ever not complicated
[06/22/19, 2:12:51 PM] <karen86> can we assume a nos heard mark say that?

[06/22/19, 2:13:46 PM] <MissNayoung> @Suedyin I wholeheartedly agree. Probably why Jasper is my fave of the main 4.
[06/22/19, 2:13:46 PM] <ivanrollit> @SarahGabriella84 I believe because annabelle said something about "stereotypes" and the lasombra looked at annabelle like she had zero idea what she was talking about
[06/22/19, 2:13:46 PM] <zodiacleopard> lolol

[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Who is Helena
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <Crossive_> Helena is the 4th gen Toreador.
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <ivanrollit> @SarahGabriella84 It's interesting. I think she walks a fine line between having a general love for fellow beings, but also a zero tolerance policy for fuckery
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <bronansef> what in gods name is this
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <SigmaUndine> Helen of troy
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Is Helena another canon character?
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <highvoltage988> https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Helena_(VTM)

[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <kuroiryu009> yes
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Who is Helena?
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <PAPerryman> !wtfisthis
[06/22/19, 2:13:50 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. The Club Maharani gala opening is threatened by gatecrashers. The coterie must cope with the intrusion without destroying the Masquerade.
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <geminichild34> Helena is an old vampire of the Toreador clan
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Helena THE Toreador
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <ZenSamurai7> I'm unfamiliar with the clan represented by blood drop?
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <Dame_90> Helena of Troy then
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <karen86> this character hasn't been introduced right?
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <Akeluus> ... *Actual* Helen of Troy?? {:Oh
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <kuroiryu009> Helena of Troy
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <kaeleakae> The question is... does Nelli really know her?
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <ivanrollit> @ZenSamurai7 it's for ghouls :)
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @ZenSamurai7 Ghoul
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <highvoltage988> @ZenSamurai7 not a clan, the symbol stands for Ghouls
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <Hellhound732> The blood drop is a ghoul
[06/22/19, 2:13:51 PM] <kingdannythewicked> Helena is antedeliviuan (sp)
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <SigmaUndine> She has in the canon, of course, but not here.
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <ZenSamurai7> ah thanks
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <zodiacleopard> lol What an interesting pair
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <Jimersion> Brad gets dissed AGAIN.
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <RagAhroun> Also, the Toreador Loresheet for V5 is 'Descendant of Helena', and Nelli has something from that.
[06/22/19, 2:13:52 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> We need a 'time for a note' emote

[06/22/19, 2:13:54 PM] <JRHiga> @Helix_Faust All I know is Helena is a Methuselah, pretty much the most poweful and oldest vampires of the game.
[06/22/19, 2:13:54 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Murder and Mayhem awaits

[06/22/19, 2:13:55 PM] <Dragonchrome> possibly also that @YokeThatOneBloke
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <chaeon1974> @sarahgabriella84 Do you understand life?
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <kingdannythewicked> her generation is far too low.
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Something bad is a about to happen.
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <karen86> wish Miranda would have stayed
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <kingdannythewicked> or they wouldn't have taken chazz so easily
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <PAPerryman> Lore allows for it in 5e
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <anderfc> wait what
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <Suedyin> Question for the Loremasters: Since Atlantis features in canon lore, are Lemuria, Mu etc also in WoD Lore?
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <aechonex> snap
[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <chaeon1974> @sarahwithouth hey gandsHug

[06/22/19, 2:13:56 PM] <KBTibbs> That's also what Jasper feels like
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Akeluus> 'd Be cool if there was muffled club music playing now, from Sky Box POV
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <SarahGabriella84> we need some dice rolling!
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <sielense> Since we are vamp lore spamming, for reference, Cain is 1st Gen, Antediluvians are 3rd Gen, Methuselahs tend to be 4th or 5th gen. Thinbloods tend to fall around 15th gen I think.
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> maybe this will be fine, people will dance and drinks , and it will be a great opening night, without incident.......
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <kira858> lol
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <PAPerryman> @Suedyin Not yet, but I'd enjoy that.
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> it could happen....
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Crossive_> Thinblood is 14+
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @GeekandSundry when will this season go on youtube?
[06/22/19, 2:13:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> @SarahGabriella84 after the end of the season

[06/22/19, 2:14:15 PM] <nyghtreaver> @HappilyMacabre true I forgot he does creature acting

[06/22/19, 2:14:15 PM] <blackboyfly45> Tzimisce if you have somone who is very skilled in working and describing can really be horrifying
[06/22/19, 2:14:15 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I hope we get a Hunter game soon
[06/22/19, 2:14:15 PM] <AFlyingBrickington> Hunter will be interesting
[06/22/19, 2:14:15 PM] <Swoosh2355> Jasper drained him, but didnt eat him

[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <Hellhound732> How powerful was the vamp Nelli diablerized?
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <jayy15951> it's my first stream how late Ng do the breaks last?
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <Axeface_the_1st> Its gonna be jasper isnt it
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @jayy15951 24 hours LUL
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <Swoosh2355> The vamp Nelli diablorized was same gen as her, both Chaz's Childer
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <anderfc> Werewolf Dark Ages would be fantastic
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <vcolev> actually surprised a mage or werewolf game hasn't been started
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <WarpedSpirit> @jayy15951 10 min
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <Corpsehandler> @Hellhound732 same gen.
[06/22/19, 2:14:16 PM] <Dragonchrome> and for those just joining a quick recap Vampire The Masquerade : L.A. By Night recap https://twitter.com/GeekandSundry/status/1142250855523061761
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> I actually really hope it's Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <girlycakez> @axeface_the_1st of course
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <GryphonCompanion> My guess is Sanchez with how dodgy he has been.
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <kingdannythewicked> @Hellhound732 same gen
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <chaoticloony> @jayy15951 about 10 minutes
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <dragonnzelda> @Hellhound732 Same as her, was another of Chaz's childer
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I would love to see a Mage game as well.
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @Hellhound732 it was another of Chaz' childer so not powerful enough to give her a power boost
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <chaeon1974> Ventrue with a Gear 1
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <blackboyfly45> if we got werewolf we should totlly get a mage
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <willsample> @jayy15951 = 10 to 15 minutes
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <Dragonchrome> about 6 ish min sof break left
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> Werewolf is such a fucking good game. I wish there were more streams with the garou
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <Axeface_the_1st> Oh wait, it could be Eva too?
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <dragonnzelda> A mage would be pretty awesome
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <Swoosh2355> I think they should expand this to other cities as well. Seattlebynight,, Sf by night..
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <Dame_90> Blood mage that is
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <SarahGabriella84> Eva is awesome!
[06/22/19, 2:14:17 PM] <blackboyfly45> ooh what about changeling?
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Alexanderhero83 who do you think would give Dracula a challenge
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <SarahGabriella84> and Jeanette!
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Choose to rage...
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <poettwist> Is Eva still around, @JCVIM? If so, I do apologize if I made you uncomfortable.
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Alexanderhero83> @elricdemelnibone I want them alll.
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <vcolev> we riot if they take eva
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <jayy15951> need to see a proffesinals produced mage game it'd be magickal
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @Lordofdragons073 Blade Kappa
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Metebelis777> Good garou RP get the body horror of it
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <blackboyfly45> i think Dracula would fall under Tzimise if im not mistaken
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Hellhound732> The club is full of kindred right now, it could be any of them, but it would be interesting for it to be Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <twitchcraft36> could it be arkangel they want? Or victor? Kyoko?
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Alexanderhero83> @lordofdragons073 Jesper
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Dragonchrome> Coterie vs Clubs
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Metebelis777> old clan yes
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <mathblade314> mathblade314 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[06/22/19, 2:14:18 PM] <Axeface_the_1st> @vcolev Indeed! Eva is the best
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <darion_mograin> Dracula is a 5th or 6th gen Tzimisce, yea.
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <Rats808> @jayy15951 agreed, i'd be 100% here for a Mage livestream
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @SarahGabriella84 but this isn't Marvel lol
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @mathblade314
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <willsample> @blackboyfly45 unless they changed the lore, Old Clan Tzim
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <Swoosh2355> They want to take Baby B
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <pretty_empic> I’m still very worried about X
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> If it turns out Archangel is Deb of Night everyone who guessed that Deb was a vampire or ghoul ten years ago is gonna feel really vindicated
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @Lordofdragons073 not yet, wait for the Disney buy out Kappa
[06/22/19, 2:14:19 PM] <witchy_jay> welcome back @mathblade314
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Alexanderhero83 I would pay to see that
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <mathblade314> Thanks @dragonchrome
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <blackboyfly45> I cant emeeber Deb
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <mathblade314> Thanks :)
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @SarahGabriella84 So true
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Swoosh2355> Deb of the night was in VTMB
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Davecom3> I think they came for the sheriff and the upstart
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Hunter, Mage , Werewolf and Vampire are all a lot of fun.
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <mathblade314> Mainly long time lurker
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <jayy15951> Deb if night being archangle would be awsome
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <StormSage> I'm new. Is there an actual board game being played here?
[06/22/19, 2:14:20 PM] <WarpedSpirit> So, who is it going to be? Sassper, Baby B, or Sanchez?
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <mathblade314> Pretty sure the scourge is here for Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <SarahGabriella84> i just love the diversity of the cast so much
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Grnngh> New inqui intel incoming - The Sesame street Count confirmed Ventrue!
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <mathblade314> To get his answer
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <sin_x911> dear god don't let disney get this
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <darion_mograin> Gosh, seeing a mage would just be exceptional.
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <blackboyfly45> K Y O K O
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Alexanderhero83> @lordofdragons073 Agreed Alex Ward make Jesper Great
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Dragonchrome> about 4 mins ish of break left , gear up for part 2, what will happen???
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <vcolev> my money is on kyoko
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <jayy15951> @stormsage table top rpg no hoard their on a short break
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <highvoltage988> @StormSage it's a roleplaying game, more like D&D than a board game
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @Alexanderhero83 not hard for a real vampire LUL
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Alexanderhero83> @sin_x911 don't you know Disney is the masquerade.
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @StormSage you just dropped in on the intermission, give it around 5 minutes or so
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <kaeleakae> !wtfisthis
[06/22/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. The Club Maharani gala opening is threatened by gatecrashers. The coterie must cope with the intrusion without destroying the Masquerade.
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> its Vampire the masquerade being played, it is an actual game system by whitewolf (like dnd but set in the world of darkness)
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Alexanderhero83 Jasper really is Dracula
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Metebelis777> Till the mage used the vamp as a souce of tass yes
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <envyjoe56> Jasper eyes 🖤
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <kinzer_trismegistus> the count from sesame street could also be an obsessive-compulsive malkavian
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <sielense> I want to see how mage plays. I imagine it would play rather differently, but I have the Awakening pdf rather than Ascension though
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <kaeleakae> !roleplaying
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Dragonchrome> #DisneyVamps
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Kinkajou1015> masquerade broken @Alexanderhero83
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <blackboyfly45> If they somehow introduce Caine
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <mathblade314> My guess is Scourge will make a power play for Jasper involving the maze and Eva
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <SarahGabriella84> Cynthia Marie tho! skills gurl!
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Dragonchrome> !roleplay
[06/22/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Ascension is beautiful. Huge fan.
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <blackboyfly45> I would lose my shit
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <StormSage> I get it. thanks. I was watching before but couldn't catch the whole story line. I'll stick around and learn more.
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Alexanderhero83> @lordofdragons073 well then I guess Dracula is cool then
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Davecom3> I think they are currently working for the Prince, and so will either get Sheriff Jasper or kill Annabell
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <kinzer_trismegistus> ascension is amazing.
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> I'd love to see Mage on Stream too
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Axeface_the_1st> I have this sinking feeling that they are coming for Eva :(
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <SarahGabriella84> we didnt see no dice to day @Nightbot LUL
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Eva is my waifu
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <highvoltage988> the Count is based on Dracula so he's clearly Old Clan Tzimisce Kappa
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Swoosh2355> @StormSage seasons 1 and 2 are on You tube
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <JackalopeLARP> I'm doing a fan rewrite of Mage for 5th Edition...
[06/22/19, 2:14:23 PM] <devzalace> boooooo
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <Metebelis777> mage with vamps or garou as custos of a coven can work well
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @blackboyfly45 I mean all they have to do is have everyone get in a cab with a driver that is very innocuous aside from a conspicuous european accent...
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <jayy15951> @stormsage season 1 and 2 are on their YouTube channel
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <dragonnzelda> For Mage, would you wanna see Technocracy or Reality Deviants? Or both hehehe. Actually saw a group stream a few sexcessions of Mage, was pretty cool
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <Dragonchrome> you can also follow LA By Night Twitter https://twitter.com/LAbyNight
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <Hellhound732> EnterElysium has a mage game going right now I think
[06/22/19, 2:14:24 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Search for Mage Eclipse.

[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @Gemini_Nightshines in yer dreams
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <sielense> I might stick with the Awakening rules, at least until Deviant comes out. Then i'll look at the Old World of Darkness stuff I think.
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <karen86> guys I brought the wine. anyone want some?
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <michaeldreamer> is there a initiative roll in the new system for combat?
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <chaeon1974> a Mage stream would be great @elricdemelnibone
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <Lordofdragons073> @Alexanderhero83 yup! He is
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @PAPerryman Thanks for the gift sub!

[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <willsample> I would think the Wyrd Sisters are a more likely target- they had to sneak them past the Camarilla once already
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <PAPerryman> A pleasure. Welcome back. Thanks for the auction btw
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <darion_mograin> Do we know when Deviant comes?
[06/22/19, 2:14:25 PM] <kaeleakae> @kgn86 I"m already half a bottle ahead of you :P

[06/22/19, 2:14:26 PM] <twitchcraft36> It has to be someone that the coterie would have to help give away or can protect otherwise why go to all this trouble someone they can't clearly take
[06/22/19, 2:14:26 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Mage The Podcast is pretty sweet, they interview a lot of the authors... and interviewed me, full disclosure.
[06/22/19, 2:14:26 PM] <dragonnzelda> @michaeldreamer No initiative
[06/22/19, 2:14:26 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> when I say stream i mea G&S stream

[06/22/19, 2:14:27 PM] <StormSage> @Swoosh2355 I saw that - well I saw season two and listened a few minutes. I think I need to listen for a much longer time to get a sense for it. Thanks!

[06/22/19, 2:14:27 PM] <PAPerryman> Can attest: Mage game is a fave of mine as well.
[06/22/19, 2:14:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> The combat system is at the Dms discression, but usually they allow the players to make the moves first
[06/22/19, 2:14:27 PM] <Dragonchrome> break should be ending soon, bring it back in folks
[06/22/19, 2:14:27 PM] <SarahGabriella84> @darion_mograin Connor is already here Kappa

[06/22/19, 2:14:33 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @Lordofdragons073 You can do what I'm doing and try the writing exercise where you write what's basically a fanfic, but you have character sheets for everyone and make rolls to see what happens, and write it whether it's where you were were planning for it to go or not.
[06/22/19, 2:14:33 PM] <Suedyin> unauthorised negotiations

[06/22/19, 2:14:35 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Sanchez will ask for protection so he and Jasper can have more *weirdly flirtly* scenes.
[06/22/19, 2:14:35 PM] <Akeluus> "... Dinner reservation for 5..."
[06/22/19, 2:14:35 PM] <anderfc> But the thing is: Sanchez is under Victor hospitality

[06/22/19, 2:14:37 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Okay so Jasper is def going to accept the job now to protect Sanchez.
[06/22/19, 2:14:37 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Chelsea is Lavender, and Mark *should be* Rook.
[06/22/19, 2:14:37 PM] <Akeluus> @Your_Local_Doggo Chelsea, code name "Lavender", is Nelli G's ghoul. Combat trained

[06/22/19, 2:14:37 PM] <CainTheConfused> Annabelle, you are NOT being super helpful tonight!
[06/22/19, 2:14:37 PM] <highvoltage988> ironic, seeing as Lucifer is very real at least in old WoD canon
[06/22/19, 2:14:38 PM] <aechonex> what did I miss

[06/22/19, 2:14:39 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[06/22/19, 2:14:39 PM] <Suedyin> @highvoltage988 Jason is very good at WoD lore and weaving in the real world sources for it
[06/22/19, 2:14:39 PM] <GryphonCompanion> oWoD games *are* in the same world.
[06/22/19, 2:14:39 PM] <Akeluus> @Suedyin Full disclosure; vamps have never been my thing, I can count on one hand the number of vamps I don't hate. But *this* show, I like {:3

[06/22/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Swoosh2355> if you played Vampire the masquerade bloodlines, those characters are in this universe (and have made some guest apperances here as well)
[06/22/19, 2:14:40 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Ventrue honor deals. Lasombra close vendettas.
[06/22/19, 2:14:40 PM] <sunnytranxiety> shame they'll be less lasombra after tonight
[06/22/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Suedyin> @Akeluus I am the same.. "Twi Hards" and goth always rather freaked me out. But I was hooked from the first syllable I heard Jason speak.
[06/22/19, 2:14:41 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> @Gazkhuul The characters are vampires.

[06/22/19, 2:14:42 PM] <Madbearv> She's a ghoul
[06/22/19, 2:14:42 PM] <Suedyin> @Akeluus for me, this is NOT a "Vampire" show, it is a sotry of personal horror, about how to be as human as we can while fighting ones veyr personal demons
[06/22/19, 2:14:42 PM] <twitchcraft36> why would they have their ghouls here?
[06/22/19, 2:14:42 PM] <truth_decay> #obscuredostoyevskyreference

[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <KaiOrAya> Giving up freedom for security. I think Ben Franklin said something about that

[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Akeluus> @Suedyin *Quite* appropriate. That's more or less what keeps me hooked. ~shows pads on clawed right hand~ Not a vamp either ;3
[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Alexanderhero83> That's a good point.
[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <HopefulNinja> maybe they should give up the sabbat lol
[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Madbearv> Time to show the party the Abyss
[06/22/19, 2:14:43 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Shadow tentacles grab Victor and shakes him like a pitbull shakes a chew toy.

[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <themerybiscuiteer> oohoo
[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <willsample> Annabelle should quote Milton right back at them--All is not lost- the unconquerable will, and study of revenge, immortal hate, and the courage never to submit or yield......

[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <chaeon1974> c'mon the Lasombra went running to the Camarilla when the Sabbat got wiped out

[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Asaaron2> Love the Lasombra so much
[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <AFlyingBrickington> @GryphonCompanion not really, certain games have lore that dirrectly contridicts others. For example Cain creating vampires
[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <truth_decay> WE WANT NUNAVUT
[06/22/19, 2:14:44 PM] <GeekandSundry> Victor is the most affably self aggrandizing vampire.

[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <SidMax38> gandsRaid
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> wait, is Jasper visible or does she just see him?
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <CainTheConfused> She addressed him and, I think, he never dropped his unseen passage.
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Onairic> @Horusrage the oldest rivalry in the book
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <CainTheConfused> Hoo.
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <KBTibbs> That's not an answer, Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Suedyin> good to see you again @Onairic and have I said I love your name?
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <chaeon1974> cold Jasper woooo
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Swoosh2355> Jasper was in unseen passage
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> Annabelle isn't going to let that happen
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to.
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Jasper would have been a good Sheriff
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <JCVIM> Someone set this place on fire
[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <HopefulNinja> She knows he's probably in there guys.

[06/22/19, 2:14:47 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @JCVIM Can Eva text Kyoko to just torch the place, clearly nothing good happens in Victor's clubs

[06/22/19, 2:14:48 PM] <JCVIM> A fire is obviously the solution here
[06/22/19, 2:14:48 PM] <vcolev> not Campbell prime!!!!
[06/22/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Akeluus> We can't have *another* club burn down. This one's brand new--they don't grow on trees, y'know @JCVIM ;3
[06/22/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Chaeron77> aggressive renovation lolol
[06/22/19, 2:14:48 PM] <tw1zt84> bold move Vic

[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <nerdypatty> omg
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Annabelle, just. No. Shut up.
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <ElliotAngelina> oh my god
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @chaeon1974 They aren't in Elysium. The Camarilla considers Victor a child playing with words he doesn't understand. Maybe they'e right.
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <MissNayoung> Yep. Basically, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <AFlyingBrickington> There's more than one way to burn down a club
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <willsample> @JCVIM- at times, I believe Victor's version of planning is 'Ready! Fire! Aim!'
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <pretty_empic> Schrodinger’s vampire security
[06/22/19, 2:14:49 PM] <jesusspicy> Oh god don’t let Annabelle talk

[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <RavenWolfe> LMAO Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <aechonex> Jasper is all of us
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Jasper gets it, just give up Sanchez, who cares?
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Rhymes_with_Orange_> what clan is the Blood drop? Assamite?
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Chaeron77> Jasper is #relatable

[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <chaeon1974> @jackalopelarp so it's only Prince's Court?
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <PAPerryman> Blood drops denote Ghouls
[06/22/19, 2:14:50 PM] <kira858> There's no way they're going to allow the scourge to walk in and do whatever they want

[06/22/19, 2:14:53 PM] <chaeon1974> @jackalopelarp Thanks!
[06/22/19, 2:14:53 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Even if the Anarchs declared an Elysium, someone's personal haven and club wouldn't be appropriate.
[06/22/19, 2:14:53 PM] <poettwist> @JCVIM I do apologize if I made you uncomfortable earlier. I was not trying to do so.
[06/22/19, 2:14:53 PM] <USAgent88> You can't save everyone. These are monsters.

[06/22/19, 2:14:53 PM] <Akeluus> 'Belle just wants to punch someone tonight. I think Jasper does too, with his teeth {:3
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <sin_x911> very
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <GeekandSundry> She's hungry.
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <paladinelmo360> "young and stupid" yep... pretty much
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <sanitarium33935> Hats off to Victor!!
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <Suedyin> goes crosseyed trying to follow everything at once
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> The coterie should really plan ahead in these situations, everyone is always doing their own thing..
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @jesusspicy How do the Sabbat do Elysium?

[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <Madbearv> well
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <kingdannythewicked> sabbat do the same as cam in elysium
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grast @jfalk1818
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <Akeluus> @Suedyin Can't miss a moment with these G&S streams. They're jam packed with plot ;P
[06/22/19, 2:14:54 PM] <Madbearv> yes and no
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <vcolev> Annie does need her ass kicked, to help bring her back to reality
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @jfalk1818
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <Madbearv> there's a higher up in the cammie
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <Suedyin> @Akeluus and so is chat! ;p
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <jesusspicy> @jackalopelarp how would they host a guest they want to kill but can’t? Not a Elysium I don’t wanna get killed
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <potterboi111> @lamiazenzibar It’s hard to plan when you’re having to look out for yourself as well as the group
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <vcolev> though jasper wont let that happen
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @vcolev My thoughts exactly
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <truth_decay> @GeekandSundry we need a vamily emote in twitch chat to welcome new subs. just sayan
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <cageygolem3107> Victor keeps trying to be neutral where I think he's starting to forget that he is an anarch and Annabelle is so naive that she's trying to save everyone
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <johjohz> It still wigs me out that a usurper is keeper of Elysium
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <CainTheConfused> ...I think I need Aurora. Help.
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <Akeluus> @Suedyin Chat is sometimes like the Parmesean Cheese on the pasta that is the Stream ;3
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <chaeon1974> oooh Baby B Burrrrrrrn
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <CainTheConfused> Er, I think I like Aurora*
[06/22/19, 2:14:55 PM] <Onairic> Damn that's a good quote. "We can't have everything. Where would we put it?"
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Vulturnos> Cant wait for the Chicago book
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Madbearv> Annabelle has been super sheltered
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> And a Steven Wright joke, Jason is bringing in all the oldies
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <paladinelmo360> i second the new emote thing
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <JCVIM> M FUCKING STRAUSS
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <GeekandSundry> @truth_decay We'll get on it
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Dragonchrome> @Akeluus so stinky?
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <JCVIM> can suck it
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @jesusspicy The Sabbat aren't known for talking to guests they don't want killed. 'Diplomats' usually under the personal and in-person protection of a high-ranking Sabbat until they leave. There is no safety for non-Sabbat among Sabbat.
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <nerdypatty> head desk
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Yeah!
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <USAgent88> @cageygolem3107 Annabelle seems to think she has more power than she does.
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <LunarLorkhan> agreed @ JCVIM
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Suedyin> ooh @Akeluus I *like* that analogy! (and I LOVE parmesan cheese! ;p )
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <ElliotAngelina> @JCVIM FACTS
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Taveria> Taveria subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 50 months, currently on a 50 month streak! <3
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Suddenly wondering if Strauss might be willing to take action on Vannavar the same way he was with LaCroix...
[06/22/19, 2:14:56 PM] <Akeluus> ... Parmesean Cheese doesn't smell? At least when it's fresh? {:3
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <RavenWolfe> agreed @JCVIM
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @Taveria
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <chaeon1974> @jcvim Can Eva take out Strauss?
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <aechonex> Nelli looking suss
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <willsample> @JCVIM - the only solution is clearly a wizarding duel.
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <WarpedSpirit> It's a trap
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <jesusspicy> @jackalopelarp I see thank you
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Sabbat do that "war against all" thing, which is why they are off raiding the ancient cities and tombs in the deserts now.
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Akeluus> ... "Parmy Shawn", however ya spell it ;P
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <GryphonCompanion> @JCVIM Strauss is freaking scary as hell. But I agree *one hundred* percent that he can suck it. Kick his ass! ^_^
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Kandogar> victor i liked your idea to make a anach version of an elysium but this is WRONG so very WRONG i am sad....
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <ElliotAngelina> set strauss...on fire
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Dragonchrome> one would think as a Vampire , they would suck it
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <poettwist> I think Eva, and perhaps the Wyrd Sisters, may want to have a little chat with Maximillian Strauss.
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <WarpedSpirit> They're got to take both Jasper and Sanchez....
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <Suedyin> the chemical common to both vomit and parmesan is butyrate, and has anti-cancer effects in vitro on gut cancer cell cultures
[06/22/19, 2:14:57 PM] <JCVIM> @willsample Certamen hmm? :)
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <itchstratch> LUL
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <vcolev> hmmm.... not sure it's a good idea for jasper to leave the group. Annabelle is strong but not sure if she is good enough to take on a sheriff's
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <sin_x911> eva definitely does not want to have a chat with strauss
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Diplomatic solution, sure. Kneel.
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <johjohz> Politics among Usurpers always seems messy, those Tremere and their bonds
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <chaeon1974> Kneel before Zod
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <JackalopeLARP> victor, if you have to tell someone you are in charge, you aren't.
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <Akeluus> Sometimes... *Sometimes* Stream chat is like Gorgonzola... pirmarily if I'm watching a rebroadcast for the first time, and spoilers fly >w<
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <willsample> @JCVIM - why not? Aside from him being a hoary old monster likely to have all kinds of dirty certamen tricks.

[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <GryphonCompanion> @sin_x911 @JCVIM A chat with Strauss....or *just* Strauss' head. ^_^
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <Suedyin> iirc, sodium butyrate interacts with the systems that regulate the acetyl groups on particular histones, either that or DNA methylation... has been a while
[06/22/19, 2:14:58 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Victor is gonna get Campbell Prime killed
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <JCVIM> @willsample I value my unlife
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Diplomatic solutions at hunger 3
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <kira858> Annabelle's a brujah, they are the elite fighters of the kindred world, she's a big girl, she can take care of herself
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <willsample> @YokeThatOneBloke - or at least his can dented.
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <cageygolem3107> @USAgent88 I agree with that and since she is such an idealist I don't think she will ever go beyond a thirteenth generation because she is unwilling to drain another
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <Dragonchrome> @YokeThatOneBloke there are always more campbells
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Get kyoko out of there please
[06/22/19, 2:14:59 PM] <ElliotAngelina> @YokeThatOneBloke it's okay, we have like what...tow more left?

[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <sin_x911> @JCVIM not even the head
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <willsample> @JCVIM -- which is why you should follow that other ancient Tremere tradition. Cheat. Bring 3 Wyrd sisters with machine guns to the Certamen :D
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <johjohz> Brujah are simply the brute force fighters, Many Banu-Haqim would beg to differ about the elite fighters of the kindred world
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @YokeThatOneBloke Campbell Prime is in a tube in the cloning facility with tubes coming out of his arms to provide DNA for the Campbell Units.
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <Akeluus> Mark is more or less just kinda there... {:'
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <LunarLorkhan> Oh Mark
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <pekoe212> Kyoko should never have learned fire spells
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> hahhahah
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <Akeluus> Mark is there to be Totally Confused
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @JackalopeLARP Oh thanks goodness!
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <Metebelis777> na campbell just had correspondence 4
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <PAPerryman> !points @JackalopeLARP
[06/22/19, 2:15:00 PM] <Nightbot> That was an excellent pun, @JackalopeLARP! Here, have some points for that one! You have been awarded 53 points!
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> Mark you’re not powerless here. It takes strength to watch and wait.
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <KBTibbs> Welcome to monsterhood, Mark!
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <JackalopeLARP> However, Campbell #47 has done a good job and he doesn't deserve it. Plus, Campbell #48 isn't fully grown yet and they can't decant him.
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <sin_x911> oh mark
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Poor Mark gets to be the fish out of water now that Annabelle's a couple months old
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <poettwist> Well, chat might be a sever under statement. Perhaps more like an arguement, if you want to be at least kind about it. Perhaps, though, a Final Death for Strauss?
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <kira858> The point being she doesn't need Jasper to take care of herself, skillset wise, brujah's are superior fighters than nos's
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <DJPheonyx> So, there is only one person who should play Campbell... Eric Campbell :P
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <Jimersion> Mark getting the crash course in vamily life.
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <DJCount> dis good
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <GeekandSundry> @DJPheonyx I mean, we've put 2 and 2 together...
[06/22/19, 2:15:01 PM] <LunarLorkhan> someone's not walking out of this club alive or free

[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <willsample> @DJPheonyx - Bruce Campbell would be an acceptable stand in :D
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <PAPerryman> Please, do not get me started on Campbell #69...
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Shadowner> be agressive
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Metebelis777> less rope to hang..more time to line up shot
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <LunarLorkhan> Strauss has had it coming for too long lol. arrogant jerkface he is
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Suedyin> those Lasombra twins were remarkably good at Spin, I think
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <WoodenMonkeyGod> sure...thats how blood bond work
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> I love that Campbell takes orders from Jasper so easily
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <poettwist> Perhaps not a Final Death, but rather a sever, and sudden, move?
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <JackalopeLARP> Campbell #13 departs and goes back to the Campbell Recharge Unit.
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <sin_x911> fucking annebell
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Flashfletch33> Here we go.....
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Madbearv> it means slavery
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <PAPerryman> drumroll
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <blackboyfly45> ah annabelle dont waste your efforts on this dude
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> oh Annabelle.... just give him up to keep peace, geez
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> and there it is
[06/22/19, 2:15:02 PM] <Jimersion> Join the revolution.
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <nerdypatty> Just give him to em LUL
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Akeluus> ... Wa-cha doin', 'Belle? {:/
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> heeeeeeeey
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <sin_x911> Erika plays this role too well
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <deathandsaints> somewhere there's probably a vault of Campbells like the Gary vault in fallout 3
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> jesus Annabelle. GARAGE remember?
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> That little oopsie about Cambell a couple episodes ago is gonna haunt this game for its entire run
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <JeffM0307> Heeeeeeey!
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <aechonex> I love Kiyoko
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <Flashfletch33> KYOKO!
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <vcolev> annie........ come on....
[06/22/19, 2:15:03 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> awesome!
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @JackalopeLARP I think that was Campbell #13 1/2. Faulty clone
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <kira858> Giving up Sanchez would go against her character, you oguys are asking for a ooc moment from her
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <Dame_90> Kiyoko with the impeccable timing
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <JRHiga> Bye club #2
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> oh boy FailFish
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <Akeluus> Dog-gonnit, we *just* got this club... ^^;;
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> @kira858 I know, I can still judge her though :D
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <JackalopeLARP> @YokeThatOneBloke Oh, well, dump him in the reclamation vats in the sub-basement. It's finally processed all the dead Campbells from the club explosion.
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <PAPerryman> Agreed @YokeThatOneBloke That one seemed half-off
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <Metebelis777> or a go full anarch moment
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <GeekandSundry> Annabelles little red book...
[06/22/19, 2:15:04 PM] <Swoosh2355> Recruiting from the Princes Court..
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <blackboyfly45> not so much out of character jut learn from a past mistake, shes playing the role perfectly and Brujah nature s dead set, but its just like those horror movies where youre yelling at the TV
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <sin_x911> she is
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <teboz89> I find the lights flicking a ominous sign
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <Jimersion> "Weird." lol
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> talk in the parking garage LUL
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <aechonex> like the garage
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <blackboyfly45> I will definitely enjoy whatever after math comes from this
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <GeekandSundry> @teboz89 pay them no mind ;-)
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <Swoosh2355> Bell is not happy about Jasper doing that
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <VermillionCrimson> That's cold Jasper LUL
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <Nemisar> @bryceizbombin spamming is fun right?
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <TrueSly1> @teboz89 lasombra powers :)
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <anderfc> RIP
[06/22/19, 2:15:05 PM] <mariacomet> Jasper is diabolical. Love it.
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <itchstratch> well rodrigo...
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <vcolev> hmmmm dirty Sanchez acting odd
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Hellhound732> Smooooooth
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> Jasper trying to play the long game. He'll hand over Sanchez if he can.
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> No way is Annabelle gonna let someone be taken against their will, everyone thinking she should do the practical thing doesn't realize that "should" and "what people do" don't always line up
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <kira858> Except she hasn't made a mistake yet to even learn from, she even saved the drug dealer. So to expect her to change when nothing has happen to cause her to change is out of character
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Annabelle and Jasper are not in the same wavelength even a little bit right now..
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <teboz89> but I can't ignore @GeekandSundry
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Suedyin> thankyou mods, @Nemisar , @GeekandSundry et al <3
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Jasper is not having any more of this.
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <HEFire> Well played Jasper
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <carfax12> I love the intrigue and each characters motivations Jason does a great job as story teller really immersive :)
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <OutofOrderShow> She's on a Path!
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Jasper taking charge FeelsGoodMan
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <LunarLorkhan> spoken like a true (former) Sabbat
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <Jimersion> ride it ride it
[06/22/19, 2:15:06 PM] <witchy_jay> @HEFire well played indeed.
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <nihilissa77> jasper knows he's taking to long to answer...and that, is his answer
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <RavenWolfe> Ride the Beast LOL
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <Akeluus> #VampEdgePlay (?)
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <kira858> exactly, folks don't seem to get that it's her idealistic nature as to why she was given a spotlight under the anarch movement. There's no way she would just change out of the blue
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <blackboyfly45> Victor, master of words
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <MsVenture> DAYUM
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <willsample> She made her pitch, he didn't bid, so Jasper is ready to move on with it.
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Until you run with the Sabbat, there's no way to explain how ridiculous they are.
[06/22/19, 2:15:07 PM] <JeffM0307> Or The most ut

[06/22/19, 2:15:10 PM] <willsample> Sanchez pulls no punches.
[06/22/19, 2:15:10 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> So for everyone who came here asking WTF is going on, as there appears to have been a fair amount, do yourselves a favor and go look at season 1, it's on the youtubes. Watching the beginning fixes that "WTF is going on" problem.
[06/22/19, 2:15:10 PM] <JeffM0307> You know you're wishin' that they'd go awayyyyy! :P

[06/22/19, 2:15:34 PM] <MissNayoung> The shadows betray you because they belong to me.
[06/22/19, 2:15:34 PM] <vcolev> victor is going to lose it if something happened here

[06/22/19, 2:15:34 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> "and then take 3 dice away" is probably worse than "I need to see your character sheet."

[06/22/19, 2:15:35 PM] <Suedyin> @kaeleakae I'm wishing that I had been keeping notes, but was multitasking and did not expect him to so far excel himself <3 hehe
[06/22/19, 2:15:35 PM] <Akeluus> Jasper's gonna use Killua tactics; wait until the *moment* the attack hits, then track it's trajectory. Brilliant
[06/22/19, 2:15:35 PM] <aechonex> Annabelle's solution to most problems is punching
