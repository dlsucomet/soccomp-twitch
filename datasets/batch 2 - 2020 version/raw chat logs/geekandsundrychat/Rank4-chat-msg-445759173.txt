[06/29/19, 2:09:30 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Vannevar is having conniptions; the idea of him fraying is interesting.
[06/29/19, 2:09:30 PM] <suttonrenee1116> Vannevar's hair is so gorgeous tonight

By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night.

[06/29/19, 2:09:31 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[06/29/19, 2:09:39 PM] <appu123y> @onidaimyo really? for now it feels more like vannevar is the one whos impatient for his destruction and suzanne seems more like the planner/manipulative

[06/29/19, 2:10:15 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> @alexander_monster Hi. I just want you to know. Whatever happens to Jasper I don’t believe this was a mistake. You followed your character’s beast compulsions and you made vampiric ferocity as trendy as ever. The way you play. The balance between a man beset by his own demons.
[06/29/19, 2:10:15 PM] <MsVenture> Oh my god are we gonna see Strikes again?
[06/29/19, 2:10:15 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> This is fine!

[06/29/19, 2:10:15 PM] <Madbearv> leylines are usually fought over
[06/29/19, 2:10:15 PM] <xo_girlwonder> when a person gifts a sub, an Angel gains their wings. And Ivan’s mutton chops gain power.

[06/29/19, 2:10:16 PM] <kira858> camarilla? haha nope, the fact that camarilla discriminates based on what clan you are makes them boring and uninteresting in my eyes.

[06/29/19, 2:10:16 PM] <Onairic> Vannevar is veeeery dependent on his Suzanne, that's for sure.

[06/29/19, 2:10:18 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> I'm not up on Tremere lingo, is "rabbit" a specific type of homonculus or some such?
[06/29/19, 2:10:19 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> Isn't there a Mage holding in Modesto..... hmmmmm...... been ages since I checked on them

[06/29/19, 2:10:19 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Beneath Griffith park is a labyrinth, David Bowie used contact magic in Labyrinth, coincidence or not?

[06/29/19, 2:10:20 PM] <sgbee816> Ohhh is that the mirror???
[06/29/19, 2:10:20 PM] <Swoosh2355> the real lay lines are in the Hollywood graveyard #onfairbanks
[06/29/19, 2:10:20 PM] <jenna_jenna233> @verdantnoodle bryandHug

[06/29/19, 2:10:22 PM] <strous1> It really looks like Vannevar mind is going south without him.
[06/29/19, 2:10:22 PM] <karen86> it all makes sense now
[06/29/19, 2:10:22 PM] <MissNayoung> You usually have to play a children's card game to enter the Shadow Realm.

[06/29/19, 2:10:23 PM] <brujahkali> vannevar looks like he is holding his beast back. he's angry
[06/29/19, 2:10:23 PM] <onidaimyo> Garrick is tremere. its possible he just has a lot of lore
[06/29/19, 2:10:23 PM] <kuroiryu009> uh huh @GeekandSundry
[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <ErikaIshii> So iiinteresting
[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <sin_x911> would think the spike was from jasper and eva's date night

[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @sorrelspiral heyy
[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <Swoosh2355> It rotates down there, so Strikes could have gotten lost easy
[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <Dragonchrome> might have been when Eva touched the thing
[06/29/19, 2:10:24 PM] <Rats808> a Mage game would be sick, but Mage doesn't have a 5th edition yet, so probably not happening any time soon rooCry

[06/29/19, 2:10:26 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> @Rats808 (more than a) Pair-a-Docs shall happen
[06/29/19, 2:10:26 PM] <Elkara_Draco> I believe she tugged on one thread... I could be mistaken
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <MissNayoung> Vannevar's mindset reminds me of what happened to Orochimaru after his arms were sealed by the Third Hokage.
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <VerdantNoodle> ♡ @appu123y
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <DracoMoon777> BRYAN IS SO GOOD.

[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <tw1zt84> Vannevar has gone full obsessed
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <Vance1982> I wonder if Eva accidentally opened a gate to the dreaming
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <karen86> @knightly2u I was literally going to ask that right now
[06/29/19, 2:10:27 PM] <LunarLorkhan> the garou will not like the Leeches poking into the Umbra ;)
[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <Swoosh2355> The Prince wants the Laylines for his own, cause he is afraid they will be used against him.
[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <geminichild34> I can hear him getting short of breath
[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <BlackCatPlays> Vannevar is stressed out

[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <geminichild34> @firehea1995 Doesn't sound like it
[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <philbe63> This is gonna get mesy
[06/29/19, 2:10:28 PM] <xo_girlwonder> Did she tear the thread or was it just a light tug?

[06/29/19, 2:10:31 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @knightly2u purely guessing on my part, but, I think he's a lot more panicky over the SI than he wants anyone to know and anything that might equal "weapon" is turning him on something fierce.

By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. The Club Maharani gala opening is threatened by gatecrashers. The coterie must cope with the intrusion without destroying the Masquerade.

[06/29/19, 2:11:07 PM] <darion_mograin> The beconing is essentially the call to the middle east that the elders feel, as of the last few years @Shadowringa

[06/29/19, 2:11:08 PM] <Swoosh2355> Fiorenza is Cam, that trumps her mentorship through Clan to Victor
[06/29/19, 2:11:08 PM] <KBTibbs> I'm so sad for Ib.
[06/29/19, 2:11:09 PM] <juicephy> LITERALLY WAS GONNA SAY THAT @onidaimyo
[06/29/19, 2:11:09 PM] <aladenya> when did Ib join the Cam?
[06/29/19, 2:11:09 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @YokeThatOneBloke Fiorenza is pretty hardline Camarilla, her relationship with Victor is unusual. It may not be that simple.
[06/29/19, 2:11:09 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @TricksterJae
[06/29/19, 2:11:09 PM] <WinterFaery84> Didn't Aurora tell Jasper that he was no longer needed as Sheriff? That her brother had taken up the mantle instead?

[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <KBTibbs> @Nouralogical I'm happy blaming Victor.
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <highvoltage988> @Nouralogical agreed, definitely Victor's fault!
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <Critternation3000> @Nouralogical SAVAGE AF
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <CleverPolarBear> @geminichild34 IB was in the Middle East :o
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <blackboyfly45> my chest blew right up
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <onidaimyo> That seems funny as Garou lore is more rare than Lasombra lore would be
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <Swoosh2355> Its always Victors fault
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <CleverPolarBear> That is where they moved to
[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <DriveFrew> I love this night : )

[06/29/19, 2:11:11 PM] <kukubee> Vannevar is making me so nervous! :O
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <gundammac0311> @nouralogical hes gonna regret not turning Ib.
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <kira858> Wait, I have the standard vampire book, there isn't a lasombra clan, where are they getting the powers and story?
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <Onairic> i seriously can't get over this, IB..... ;;
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <knightly2u> @Nouralogical WOW

[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <kuroiryu009> all victore's fault
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <geminichild34> Victor is going to freak when he findout

[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <Nouralogical> @canadiankazz he was
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <Aeriqui> A Lasombra with IB's skills could wipe out hundreds of people in a night
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <Gryphon_oFH> not only a Lasombra -- but as a Ghoul first, with the embrace, it's possible that certain abilities she had as a ghoul have been retained.... or enhanced as well
[06/29/19, 2:11:12 PM] <ErikaIshii> Poor Victor...
[06/29/19, 2:11:13 PM] <Swoosh2355> IB the invincible!
[06/29/19, 2:11:13 PM] <Deathstar_Taco> @onidaimyo perhaps it is for the benefit of others unseen Watchers, perhaps..
[06/29/19, 2:11:13 PM] <kuroiryu009> *Victor
[06/29/19, 2:11:13 PM] <appu123y> its not like victor COULD turn IB

[06/29/19, 2:11:17 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> The change in behavior between Ghoul Ib and Vampire Ib is noticeable. Nicely done @Nouralogical
[06/29/19, 2:11:17 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Yeah, convinced at this point Vannevar is going to either lose it or very suddenly turn to ash. Or run out of the room and straight for the middle east right now.
[06/29/19, 2:11:17 PM] <onidaimyo> Vanevar is totally fighitng hte beckoning
[06/29/19, 2:11:17 PM] <lschantz> Vannevar I think is feeling some pressure from the Anarchs, and they are more than he thought

[06/29/19, 2:12:05 PM] <harberst> @mithrilmist I'm still freaking out that Ib is kindred now. The backstabbery is just icing.
