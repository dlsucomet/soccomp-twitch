[07/6/19, 10:59:08 PM] <firehea1995> I guess Vannevar has yet to become a Prince at this point in time
[07/6/19, 10:59:08 PM] <harberst> So uh.. is "Marie" meant to be that Marie?
[07/6/19, 10:59:08 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @gwcnpool same
[07/6/19, 10:59:08 PM] <willsample> Baby Vannevar is like a bright eyed boy scout.

[07/6/19, 10:59:09 PM] <darkofnate> I'm a little disappointed that Suzanne turns out to be her real name. I was hoping it would something like, Betty Smellington...
[07/6/19, 10:59:09 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> Alex Ward as a fucking prince, that's so strange since Jasper is as far away from cammy as possible
[07/6/19, 10:59:09 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> Still so very Sasper. :D

[07/6/19, 10:59:29 PM] <goIdendeviant> So I'm pretty sure this was prerecorded but was this done right after the previous episode? Because if so, the difference in the acting is insane omg.

[07/6/19, 10:59:39 PM] <dannymoriarti> @onairic ya don‚Äôt say. Wouldn‚Äôt want to be a Kindred with money, that‚Äôs for sure
[07/6/19, 10:59:39 PM] <softdechart> @cattttty bryandLUL bryandLUL good to know i‚Äôm not alone

[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> @RecorderEvans i concur
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <RecreationalCephalopod> i am sitting in a room full of Very Tall bookshelves O.O
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <Jshinkoku1600> @jordyntrangsrud01 if you enjoy this. might i suggest going to Geek and Sundry Youtube page and watch this show from the beginning. it is really worth it in my opinion. I love this show. After Critical Role left to do its own thing I was glad to see this show step up and take over.
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <darkofnate> @captainwierdbeard It's Suzanne's memory, not Vannevar.
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <desinoodles> OH WE JUST FELT THE EATHQUAKE
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <CaityRose> I love seeing the contrast of how they were in the beginning and how they are now. They play it so well, wow
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @ErikaIshii You are safe there please
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <LamiaZenzibar> Is Fracoise still alive today?

[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <GeekandSundry> We're good!
[07/6/19, 10:59:40 PM] <messiah666rc> is this 5th edition ???
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <highvoltage988> stay safe LA friends!
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <pekoe212> @erikaishii more oh no!

[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <gundammac0311> @shidareaki need to call my mom in South Pas make sure she's ok.
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <origamiheartsam> Please tell me I‚Äôm not the one who got a quake
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <MrPIunderloot> Francoise and Suzanne are Toreador, aka the Roses, and Vannevar is a Ventrue aka the Kingmakers, hence the symbols, the blood drop means they are Kine not Kindred
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <SmilingDays2015> and @BryanDechart stay safe there!
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <mulberrymint> stay safe!
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <geminichild34> @CaityRose Agreed
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <onidaimyo> Earthquake?
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <Onairic> @dannymoriarti should've had a malkavian give them a vision on what was to come haha
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <desinoodles> i got it too
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <Swoosh2355> (those wondering whats going on this is France in 1790ish, a flashback Suzanne is having to try to remember some key things to help with the present and the ley lines in Griffith Park)
[07/6/19, 10:59:41 PM] <twitchcraft36> is erikaishii actually in the chat with us while doing live? huh?
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <SvetAm> since they mentioned that this is Suzanne's memory and that her memory isn't foolproof and can be faulty, any contradictions with established canon are covered that way.... :-)
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> The wardrobe for this episode is so amazing
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <ElliotAngelina> ?waoh two in a day
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <the_wizard_of_disaster> it's a biggy
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <mariacomet> This is absolutely like the conversation between Victor and Thomas. With one much younger vamp trying to warm the older one and the older one declaring age, rank and experience.
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <ErikaIshii> Little baby quakes. Long ones!
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> @darkofnate semantics
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <totoro235> no
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <darkofnate> Stay safe, LA folks

[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <softdechart> quake?
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <onidaimyo> So was Vannevar more open minded ages ago?
[07/6/19, 10:59:42 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I feel History coming on
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <anderfc> Not today San Andreas LUL

[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @ErikaIshii how's you could know that?
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Jshinkoku1600> @jordyntrangsrud01 characters in this game for the most part are personal to the story they have written. This is a game where YOU the player are the STORY. you aren't playing some premade character that already exists (typically speaking)
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Stay safe!
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Swoosh2355> Stay safe in LA
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Hellhound732> Oh, LA, stay safe
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <jordyntrangsrud01> @jshinkoku1600 I might have to check it out thanks!
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <envyjoe56> Holly shit I felt it
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Suedyin> if there is an earthquake, then LA friends my thoughts are very much with you
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <karen86> @hellhound732 LA
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <RomeoCasanova> To all affected by the quakes, Stay safe
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <desinoodles> it was small
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Critternation3000> @ErikaIshii be safe
[07/6/19, 10:59:43 PM] <Ziln00bas> if this was live it would be a heck of a thing to see the EQ hit
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <softdechart> stay safe LA
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <shidareAKI> That‚Äôs the fourth one in two days
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <itchstratch> damn, still aftershocks? gotta call my aunt then
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <highvoltage988> @MrPIunderloot the blood drop is more specifically for ghouls, kine in general have been without symbol so far
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <carfax12> I love Alex's Wig!
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <ElliotAngelina> the earth is quaking over this performance
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> erika accent! omg
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <Spoiledchestnut> we know this ends poorly ;w;
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <annajane05> stay safe LA friends!

[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <Suedyin> sending prayers, blessings and thoughts to you all
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <megmhanna> Baby Vannevar makes sense
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <desinoodles> The earthquake was subtle IMO
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <softdechart> @ziln00bas bryandLUL bryandLUL
[07/6/19, 10:59:44 PM] <RecreationalCephalopod> dammit, san andreas, i thought you were done, yesterday!!

[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <OutofOrderShow> Another earthquake
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <SvetAm> this is obviously the Vampire attempt at a tie-in to USA Independence Day
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <jordyntrangsrud01> @jshinkoku1600 cool! sounds fun! I've never played!
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @vampiresnvino you heard this?
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <onidaimyo> It almost sounds like Vannevar and Suzanne were Anarch sympathizers long ago
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <RecreationalCephalopod> the acting so good making the earth move
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <appu123y> babby suzanne and Vannevar are too cute
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <origamiheartsam> I‚Äôm not gonna sleep tonight. I‚Äôll wait for another aftershock. Screw the sleep schedule
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <vampiresnvino> @SmilingDays2015 Heard what?
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <ErikaIshii> We‚Äôre safe! Long but sort of gentle
[07/6/19, 10:59:45 PM] <LunarLorkhan> D:

[07/6/19, 10:59:46 PM] <Suedyin> so... can Ley lines cause earthquakes?
[07/6/19, 10:59:46 PM] <annajane05> lol the acting is shaking the earth to the core üòÇ
[07/6/19, 10:59:46 PM] <le_honey_badger> hey, Just arrived, is this freackin Fran√ßois villon right there ?! PogChamp

[07/6/19, 11:00:03 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> You are doing dice rolls in a past tense scene? This is some risky time traveling
[07/6/19, 11:00:03 PM] <highvoltage988> Lucita is like the *iconic* Lasombra from the novels and such
[07/6/19, 11:00:03 PM] <just_jessica_21> @RecreationalCephalopod bryandHeart

[07/6/19, 11:00:03 PM] <Suedyin> a question for anyone with acting skill: Does playing more diverse roles help keep each of them fresh? (maths+science trained here so I don't know)

[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <Kr4sh3r> These actors are killing it now playing different roles. Young Vannevar is my favorite changeover, the humility in his expression
[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <SmilingDays2015> yep
[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <HopefulNinja> OK, how much fun did you guys have??????

[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <johjohz> Karsh is probably dead, as far as we know. Lucita however is very dead absorbed into the abyss
[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <webbyghost> B Dave does such good work ahhhhhh
[07/6/19, 11:00:06 PM] <superratlord> @vampiresnvino did you not feel like wearing guyliner and rouge as well? I feel like you would have looked smashing.
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <higgensbiggens> Karsh is mongolian @onidaimyo
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <tw1zt84> wise kindred
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <Myladyfarangis> I love Karsh's voice
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <nooneinparticilar1273> Why do they say Rochelle and not Suzanne??
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <PharaohOzymandias> Right his expression is on point for young Vannevar
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <xdemelza> you all feel the earthquake omg
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <MsVenture> B Dave is killing it
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <shadow1980> Karsh must be old
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <phfighter> such a nice light tone after last week's heavy events

[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <cyndancer> Guys it‚Äôs been a dream of mine for years to play Lucita!!
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <onidaimyo> Well didn't Lucita die in the Ghenna plot?
[07/6/19, 11:00:07 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> B Dave killing it as a gangrel

[07/6/19, 11:00:08 PM] <Zhunix> Wow Karsh' voice and accent! <3
[07/6/19, 11:00:08 PM] <GeekandSundry> Now watch B. Dave slip seamlessly into and out of character as he goes from character direction to speech, it's really really good
[07/6/19, 11:00:08 PM] <cinphoria> @nooneinparticilar1273 it's Mlle. Rochelle
[07/6/19, 11:00:08 PM] <darion_mograin> Is Karsh one of the Anda? :o

[07/6/19, 11:00:09 PM] <RecreationalCephalopod> @Suedyin it can help keep it interesting, if nothing else. sometimes, you can get Really good at one thing, and get locked into only getting those kinds of roles. mixing it up is a good way to flex other muscles and keep your chops fresher, yea. plus? villains are super fun. ;P
[07/6/19, 11:00:09 PM] <goIdendeviant> An earthquake? I hope all of you are okay
[07/6/19, 11:00:09 PM] <xdemelza> WAS huge in vegas the EARTHQUAKE

[07/6/19, 11:00:15 PM] <Suedyin> @onidaimyo indeed, as Jason said, vampires are individuals first
[07/6/19, 11:00:15 PM] <Kr4sh3r> How does chat know about the history? Do I need to read the modern edition Vampire book?

[07/6/19, 11:00:36 PM] <Ziln00bas> was the year stated for this memory? wondering how close to 1789 it is

[07/6/19, 11:00:52 PM] <super390> @BlackCatPlays Jason cleverly explained that one's memories accessed in this way might confuse people's faces with those who came later. Thus the resemblance to our modern Coterie.
[07/6/19, 11:00:52 PM] <tommygunangels> Vannevar is shook.

[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <Suedyin> @onidaimyo memories are stories we constantly retell ourselves- and there is also the personal perception bias
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <RecreationalCephalopod> @macccachino i was wondering if this was their first meeting!
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <onidaimyo> The Cam, the Sabbat even the Anarchs aren't all good or all bad
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <SvetAm> back in a few. changing computer locations

[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <krazyflower> I almost feel bad for Vannevar.
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <recursion2501> what would be the french equivalent of the valley
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <Swoosh2355> No Vannevar is about 13 years a vampire
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Which is weird, because Karsh is harder to say with a French accent than without one.
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <geminichild34> @envyjoe56 No he has been embraced
[07/6/19, 11:00:56 PM] <vampiresnvino> @envyjoe56 In this era he is a vampire, embraced about 13 years ago.
[07/6/19, 11:00:57 PM] <SmilingDays2015> @CaityRose did you say three?
[07/6/19, 11:00:57 PM] <gryphangirl> What clan is Lucita?

[07/6/19, 11:00:57 PM] <Tamlaeyn> hmm. pre=recorded for holiday?
[07/6/19, 11:00:57 PM] <macccachino> @RecreationalCephalopod they did say they'd never met before this (then again, whether or not that's true is admittedly another question, but so far it's what we know :D )
[07/6/19, 11:00:57 PM] <appu123y> @gryphangirl la sombra I believe
[07/6/19, 11:00:58 PM] <Metebelis777> ironically those who cast off the illusion of maintaining humanity..tend to have strongest morals..

[07/6/19, 11:01:23 PM] <super390> These kings would have wars with their relatives, but send the common folk to fight each other. France had been in one major war after another, and the bills came due.

[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <Suedyin> @megjane42 the ley lines, this was the last time she heard of them
[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <MissNayoung> THis reminds me of this anime i love called The Rose Of Versailles.

[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <BlackCatPlays> I'm guessing Suzanne and Vannevar are the only survivors of a massacre
[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <rouxzes> the tone he is using is hysterical to me
[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <super390> @megjane42 She's desperately trying to recall what she once heard about ley lines - because she now wants to capture the one next to Jasper's hideout.
[07/6/19, 11:01:26 PM] <megjane42> ahhhh thanks!
[07/6/19, 11:01:27 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @megjane42 she's looking for information about the weird ley line magic that goes on at Griffith Park

[07/6/19, 11:01:38 PM] <DemosthenesHPW> OH RIGHT, VANNEVAR AND SUZANNE ARE HERE

[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <B0sh1> Servants always getting themselves killed.
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> A roomba can survive a beheading
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Bucket. Never Forget FeelsBadMan
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <Suedyin> this is a great way to see how the sheer length of Kindred history could damn them to constantly repeat the same cycles.... maybe
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <the_wearywolf> it's fun to see a sane vannevar..
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <tvk37> Marie as Lucita....I dig it. :)

[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <Rats808> something tells me this might be part of why Suzanne and Vannevar act the way they do in the modern nights
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <Swoosh2355> Cam treats mortals as cattle pretty much
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <krazyflower> If Vannevar and Suzanne went through all of this for years, no wonder they turned out this way.
[07/6/19, 11:01:39 PM] <vcolev> anyone feel that quake in southern cali?

[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <Ziln00bas> what gen is Lucita?
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <thc1138> Because Oblivion.
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <onidaimyo> Jason said the Memoriam isn't 100% accurate
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <thc1138> @Remagenify Lasombra.
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <cinphoria> Lucita is 7th gen
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <Ossborn> @Remagenify Lasombra
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <johjohz> Lucita needs a flashlight. All Lasombra fear the dark
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <Ziln00bas> @remagenify Lesombra
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <geminichild34> @Remagenify Lasombra
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <feedhim_igs> @webbyghost Yep! I get back to visit my mom this Sunday so I‚Äôll probably watch it (again) it‚Äôs funny :))

[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> @vampiresnvino congrats for this wonderful idea for an episode, you guys did a terrific job!
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <shadow1980> is jack a pirate around this time?
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <SmilingDays2015> ah
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <the_wearywolf> @johjohz HAHAHA
[07/6/19, 11:02:20 PM] <Cerrasponda> @johjohz we are the dark
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <MissNayoung> Now that i think about it i would love to see a historical vampire drama on TV.
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <dogplayingpiano> Probably 6th after she gives her vladdy the old bad slupr
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <Vance1982> well we know vannevar and suzanne survive
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <thc1138> @thinbloodturnedventrue He'd retired from Piracy.
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <Lycandros> Hunters?!
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <origamiheartsam> Hey everyone I‚Äôm back!
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <Ossborn> @Ziln00bas pretty low I guess, given that she was embraced in 1190
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <onidaimyo> Its formed from emotions, nightmares, dreams,ect. Vampires cannot remember every detail of their past with total accuracy. They would go mad
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <MissNayoung> Seeing this being done in a tabletop RPG just gave me the idea.

[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <Dragonchrome> Grats @Flashfletch33
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @thinbloodturnedventrue he was embraced in the 1600s if that helps
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <jordyntrangsrud01> time to go Suzanne and Vannevar!
[07/6/19, 11:02:21 PM] <GeekandSundry> Gotta name check Discord huh Byran
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Dosboyevsky> they had discord back then?
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> @ErikaIshii I like that mix of French and German you used btw
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Acr6007> discord? discourse?
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <onidaimyo> Vannevar was actualy reasonable at one point?
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> One I misse a lot is Smilin Jack
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @Vance1982 They may not survive this version of the scene, though. The memories aren't perfect and it can go off the rails.
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> haha Vanny wants to have an accord... sound like Victor much?
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Myladyfarangis> Dammit Vannevar please be quiet
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <webbyghost> Ah I would love a historical vampire show, and it could have different seasons based on different time periods and cultures
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Metebelis777> all shaded by flaws and periods of derangement, color view of time. Vannevars issues in modern scene a good example
[07/6/19, 11:02:22 PM] <Ziln00bas> so the Beast calling Lucita "daughter" isn't Cain. ok. ty--mobile watching limits my Googling

[07/6/19, 11:03:14 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Is in LA area but didn't feel the aftershock, but definitely felt the 7.1 earlier. (No damage, but it was a long bit of rolling shaking)
[07/6/19, 11:03:14 PM] <tenheadhydra> Let them eat GOLD
[07/6/19, 11:03:14 PM] <KaiOrAya> @DarkestArgentum Yeah, but felt it is different from damage or danger
[07/6/19, 11:03:14 PM] <GeekandSundry> We're all good post quake here at the studio.

[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <twitchcraft36> Question. Why is it that the story of Carmilla gets sidelined?
[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <just_jeri> You know, i can hear some people singing off in the background, it sounds like the song of angry man

[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <sielense> @cinphoria Yes. Yes we can. Anything is possible with enough cake.
[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> The cake was a lie even in the revolution!
[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <JundtDH> I am a pretty good distance from where it was centered, it certainly got the attention of many people, but it does seem normal, and that not too much damage has occurred or been determined yet. Thank you for thinking of the Californians that feel some shaking, but wait until all the news is gathered before worrying
[07/6/19, 11:03:15 PM] <winnie_rose> i wonder what fangs everyone uses, they always look awesome

[07/6/19, 11:03:16 PM] <sparklegemlongbottom> glad everyone is ok there!

[07/6/19, 11:03:16 PM] <Suedyin> @twitchcraft36 this is still the Camarilla story, showing how the past shapes the present
[07/6/19, 11:03:16 PM] <Iridescent_Shadow> I heard there was odd earth quake activity earlier this month. Like a rapid succession of them
[07/6/19, 11:03:16 PM] <Swoosh2355> They were all like come to the dark side we have cake, and it was a lie, they only had half eaten cookies
[07/6/19, 11:03:16 PM] <cyber_dno28> @BryanDechart Oh hello
