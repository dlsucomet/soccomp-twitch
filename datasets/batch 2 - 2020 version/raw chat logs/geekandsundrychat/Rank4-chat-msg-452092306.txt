[07/13/19, 2:21:21 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @lschantz the worst part is that I have objectively bad taste in music and I basically just like anything catchy
[07/13/19, 2:21:21 PM] <Jimersion> Thank you, Abrams!

[07/13/19, 2:21:22 PM] <sgbee816> I'm gonna steal a look at my own personal photo of the sign to see how close I was to that
[07/13/19, 2:21:22 PM] <MidnightMonologies> Was there a scene before this.. or am I in time?
[07/13/19, 2:21:22 PM] <Suedyin> @SteinnarrTV if you like roleplay and DM skills, rewatch to catch what you missed- but stay for now?
[07/13/19, 2:21:22 PM] <dustykiwi> everyone is so fashionable

[07/13/19, 2:21:24 PM] <GeekandSundry> ABOUT TIME: We're using variable time to show threat tonight, Jason may tell us how close sunrise is, but it is not a realtime countdown, it's just an idea for context. 10 minutes may take longer then 10 minutes or less depending on game mechanics and story.

[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Ahhh the mod shot down my timescale observation XD
[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <Ziln00bas> Better hope nobody casts fireball on Annabelle... wait wrong system. ish
[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <Vance1982> Cain knows everything that happens in LA, which is not surprising for a taxi driver
[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <melkorgoth> All this fire talk, is Kioko joining them?
[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <annajane05> it is happening

[07/13/19, 2:21:27 PM] <phfighter> Sure mom
[07/13/19, 2:21:28 PM] <lschantz> @AlhazredsGamingGoo the rules basicly allow for after 3 rounds of combat and after that it should be determined who is going to win and you can narriarate the remainder of the scene
[07/13/19, 2:21:28 PM] <highvoltage988> sidenote: Apothic Red is a damn good wine when you're super nervous about your favorite fictional characters
[07/13/19, 2:21:28 PM] <Shadowringa> Awww

[07/13/19, 2:21:28 PM] <BiblioTeq> I hope they expect Eva's gonna peel off for Jasper, 'cause that's what she's gonna do.

[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <Buddhabink> They need that Gangrel force on their side!
[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Buddhabink she went off on a mission a few episodes ago, it's not clear
[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> I think it would make my month if the end of this has a hasty retreat and someone has to hail the first cab they see. "Where to?" "Oddly european accent for an LA cab driver but you know what, not complaining, just away from here"
[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Woah, what did I miss? Seriously, my stream died.

[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <highvoltage988> I still think Juan is Caine, he's just been busy this season so that's why we haven't seen him
[07/13/19, 2:21:30 PM] <annajane05> @lschantz no I'm all caught up but Jasper AHHHH this is so stressful

[07/13/19, 2:21:31 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @lschantz I know three rounds and out/three rounds for combat, but I kinda try to expect looser rules on a streamed game for dramatic nessesity.

[07/13/19, 2:21:31 PM] <DarkestArgentum> @elliotaprod heh maybe Juan is a Nos Ghoul ppl tend to forget him
[07/13/19, 2:21:31 PM] <WinterFaery84> I'm on the fence about Ib right now......I don't know WHAT to think about that.

[07/13/19, 2:21:32 PM] <GeekandSundry> ABOUT TIME: We're using variable time to show threat tonight, Jason may tell us how close sunrise is, but it is not a realtime countdown, it's just an idea for context. 10 minutes may take longer then 10 minutes or less depending on game mechanics and story.
[07/13/19, 2:21:32 PM] <teboz89> :)

[07/13/19, 2:21:33 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> I am ODDLY stuck dwelling on Fiorenza's message. Fiorenza's relationship with Victor is unusual and until right that second I would've believed more that she would've favored the Cam over him. Brilliant little bit of storytelling.

[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <xYuux> Now it‚Äôs a definite trap lmfao
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <pnutzgg> last O
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <MissNayoung> Thankfully they found him now. Now comes the tough part.

[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <SmilingDays2015> hahaha
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <BiblioTeq> @DarkestArgentum I hope so. Strauss could do some serious damage.
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <just_jeri> Roses, never take them into the war games i guess.
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <JeffM0307> Third "O"
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <celestria129> jasper or someone bloodmaic to look like him
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <GeekandSundry> Close to the D
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <krazyflower> They have Jasper wired and strapped to a blood bomb.
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <super390> I think of her as more of a "Luna" myself.
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <ThaDaLinkWent> If it's Strauss this will be bad
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Next to the D
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <Nouralogical> Hollywooooo
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <Davecom3> not necessarily Jasper. might be what they are supposed to look at as a trap
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Entirely possible Jasper is not the one stuck on the O and it's a decoy
[07/13/19, 2:21:35 PM] <Swoosh2355> whose the leader lol
[07/13/19, 2:21:36 PM] <Critternation3000> the O shishNONO

[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <krazyflower> Annabelle does not stealth.
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <shidareAKI> kick some ass, Belle!
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <tharpy23> well that's one way to do it
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <BiblioTeq> @Nouralogical I didn't see a submarine there...
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <primelocust> Is Jason standing or on a stool?
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <xYuux> Ah shit here we go again.
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <primelocust> Always wondered
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <willsample> who needs surprise anyway?
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Suedyin> @AlhazredsGamingGoo absolutely, wheels within wheels... the subtlety and labyrinthine machinations are another reason to love this so much
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Aeriqui> stealth doesn't matter much here, it's speed and efficiency
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Jimersion> Standing.
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <SorenTheWarrior> I've nevver seen an Amalgam used before even in my time playing V5
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Wolfsbane93> standing
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <SmilingDays2015> is that tea time?
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <tharpy23> Jason stands
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Andyinsomnia> floating @primelocust
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Wolfsbane93> i believe
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <Blackomega20> annabelle brought mollies... stealth was always the lesser option
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @primelocust hes sitting down he just has really long torso
[07/13/19, 2:21:37 PM] <WinterFaery84> If it's blood magic on the "O", it HAS to be Strauss.....no wait!!! It's the guy Ivan played last week! What was his name?!
[07/13/19, 2:21:38 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Think we might see Annabelle get her first stain here. If she has to feed to keep going and save Jasper, she'll do it.
[07/13/19, 2:21:38 PM] <Ziln00bas> BLOW ANY STEALTH & surprise!!?! Are Her clan the Barbarians of VtM?

[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Knew it!
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> There was a FireFight!

[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <tw1zt84> That chopper is going down
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <prismaticfaerie> This all seems too easy
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <faethepagann> @XcNoFaQuEcX yes!
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <Ziln00bas> is it better to shoot a vampire in the head or the heart? assuming normal ammo
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <WinterFaery84> @geminichild34 He was, he still could be, OR he could be dominated to be walking around like that, and the body on the "O" could be a decoy since there is blood magic on it.
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> jcvimRaid jcvimRaid jcvimRaid jcvimRaid its go time vamily!
[07/13/19, 2:21:50 PM] <krazyflower> It's an ambush!

[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <WinterFaery84> @oldschoolboy2k It HAS to be a decoy.
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <Aeriqui> I hope Eva pulls a ghost in the shell and jumps out the helicopter and gets jasper
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <tharpy23> Brute squad move your asses

[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <Aeriqui> I fully expect the Cam to bring a tank
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Crouching Low Hidden Jasper
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <kira858> Wouldn't Greg have second inquisition weaponry?

[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> jcvimHi @ALK824 !
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @Ziln00bas gameplay wise it doesnt matter. a called heart or head shot would add difficulty but most liekly be fatal instantly
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <CaptainTalon447> Hey everyone
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <annajane05> has nobody brought up how close it is to sunrise?
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Ziln00bas it's about the amount of total damage so it's not all that important, more bullets is better
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <CaptainTalon447> How are things?
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <aechonex> ph mprd
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <WinterFaery84> @geminichild34 that too.....
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <purgosgaming> is Eva a ghost in this game?
[07/13/19, 2:21:51 PM] <Ziln00bas> @xxsilentechoesxx g2k. ty
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @prismaticfaerie that's not necessarily suspicious, they were tipped off and got here early
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <tw1zt84> oof
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <geminichild34> @purgosgaming She is invisible
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <boldtSketches> Please let this not be Jasper
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <krazyflower> @kira858 Could be limited rounds.
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <ArcaneFayth> She‚Äôs invisible right now I think
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <ALK824> is there a reason why Eva is a ghost?
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <Ziln00bas> @geekandsundry ty
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <recursion2501> they are shooting jasper monkaS

[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <SageKhensu> Lavender is good at guns, so here's hoping
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <Blackomega20> requires more dakka, no exceptions
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <geminichild34> @ALK824 shes invisible
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <fleshhy> @ALK824 she's invisible
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <chaoticloony> @ALK824 She is invisible
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <mysterioustranger1982> she's just so pale she's translucent
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Victor with a golden rifle lol
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <e1_koltrast> Remember the three vampires whose biggest problems where a poacher in their small collage domain?
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <highvoltage988> @kaeleakae Man's NEVER hot
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> @ALK824 Eva is obfuscated right now
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <kingdannythewicked> @ALK824 using obscufate
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <Andyinsomnia> she used obfuscate @ALK824
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <phfighter> We should all be in a coffee bar watching this together
[07/13/19, 2:21:52 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Eva is using cloak of shadows i think
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <purgosgaming> oh its a invisible spell?
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <Ziln00bas> is Victor using the scope INSTEAD of enhanced senses?
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <annajane05> @alk824 she's invisible
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <boldtSketches> @e1_koltrast good times, good times
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <sielense> Unseen passage
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <recursion2501> sjes in unseen passage
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> EZ

[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <geminichild34> @oldschoolboy2k Unseen Passage
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <sorrelspiral> @purgosgaming yup!
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <ALK824> lol, thank you everyone
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <mariacomet> I like #allbusinessAnnabelle a lot
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <Crossive_> Eva used a Ritual of Unseen Passage.
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <Onairic> I dont believe Victor has auspex
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <kaeleakae> @highvoltage988 Ahaha you caught the reference :P
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <boldtSketches> @purgosgaming Jasper taught her obfuscate at some point
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @Ziln00bas vampires in this setting aren't really more vulnerable in the head unless you take the head off completely, so assuming no special head popping weapons, it's better to unload center mass.
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> rooEZ
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <fleshhy> Yeah lavender's a great ghoul, special forces training etc.
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <purgosgaming> cool sorry i just started watching
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <WinterFaery84> Eva , be careful!!! There's blood magic there!
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <recursion2501> "jasper"
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <aechonex> I bet it's not Jasper
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <TOJ8> this is some effective team work so far
[07/13/19, 2:21:53 PM] <highvoltage988> @kaeleakae of course! perspiration ting!
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <Ziln00bas> @alhazredsgaminggoo ty
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <ALK824> head-popping weapons sound pretty cool actually
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I think shots to the head still really hurt Vampires in fiction
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> NO!
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <fkyealemurs> AN FUCKING HOUR
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <Swoosh2355> tic toc
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <sorrelspiral> NotLikeThis
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <LunarLorkhan> if not necessarily in terms of mechanics
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <aechonex> oh man the stress!
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <anderfc> oh no
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <GeekandSundry> Fun Fact: Jason of course can't see we've made Eva invisible, so we're trusting his memory that she's unseen.
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <SmilingDays2015> ehh?
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <faethepagann> shiiiittt

[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <Ziln00bas> @alk824 "Eva gonna save ya" nice
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <melkorgoth> Am I the only one who has the faith in Ib, and thinks Jasper is so BA that they bait and switched the Cams.....And Jasper just got shot?
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <sumbuh_aertinz> Highpowered wood bullets
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <Suedyin> gosh the mental theatre! <3 fanart?
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <GeekandSundry> ABOUT TIME: We're using variable time to show threat tonight, Jason may tell us how close sunrise is, but it is not a realtime countdown, it's just an idea for context. 10 minutes may take longer then 10 minutes or less depending on game mechanics and story.
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <krazyflower> Oh crap. It's that violet blue when you can see the beginnings of sunrise.
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> oh wow the HUD element
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <Andyinsomnia> that is 3600 seconds. all the time in the world
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <recursion2501> gameplay time does not equal in story time
[07/13/19, 2:21:54 PM] <mariacomet> Cool effect @GeekandSundry
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <purgosgaming> i like the DMs symbol
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <Suedyin> Battle Angel Eva <3
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I don't like that countdown timer
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <ALK824> it's cool, just go hide in a shed if the sun comes up Kappa
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <razahphon> Its the final count down
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <SmilingDays2015> Do you have 90 minutes?
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <Ralph6555> UH OH Here we go
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <fkyealemurs> @GeekandSundry WE SALUTE YOUR TECH AND EDIT TEAM, TOP NOTCH CONTENT!
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <boldtSketches> @GeekandSundry thanks for clarification
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <shidareAKI> I love that effect so much. It makes me happy every time they get to use it
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <kingdannythewicked> gun shots to the head are annoying to vamps not fatal ALA debra-ann Woll's scene in true blood when jason head shots her PB
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <WinterFaery84> I'm so nervous!!
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <XcNoFaQuEcX> Eva, Battle Angel!
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <anderfc> 24H count down sound effect
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <Glandire> As we were not tense enough, a countdown. Eyyyy.
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <Ziln00bas> @geekandsundry proof that time is relative!
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <pnutzgg> they save him and have one last hug before becoming toast in dawn
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <batunian> I missed the start, what has happened?
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @AlhazredsGamingGoo well a called heart shot is fatal. just like a stake attack. its just increasingly difficult. i think its like 10 dmg total in a single attack or something
[07/13/19, 2:21:55 PM] <sielense> We're leaving together
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <happinexsx> only now i noticed Eva is transparent
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <Swoosh2355> just use a chainsaw...

[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <SmilingDays2015> oh.....eva
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <chaoticloony> I do believe that we have one of the best Crews on Twitch
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <mariacomet> Gah, we're already almost an hour in. Feels like only 10 min have passed
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <happinexsx> @batunian they organized where to go and what to do!
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <fkyealemurs> I live in the ghetto, so i thought it was on my end XD
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <Blackomega20> kindred take all bullets etc as minor damage regardless of shot location. its not their bane like fire.
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <Suedyin> @batunian a lot, and it has been top quality every moment- worth watchign from the start imo
[07/13/19, 2:21:56 PM] <mojojojo52> (Insert Joker voice) "And here we go..."

[07/13/19, 2:22:01 PM] <mariacomet> This seems like a first wave not the "boss" fight. Hang tight vamily.
[07/13/19, 2:22:01 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Jersey Shore is so old at this point I wonder if Annabelle would know the source of that line or just absorbed it through osmosis
[07/13/19, 2:22:01 PM] <Gemini_Nightshines> Belle burning thru willpower
[07/13/19, 2:22:01 PM] <highvoltage988> @shidareAKI and if all goes terribly, at least she has chicken

[07/13/19, 2:22:02 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @AlhazredsGamingGoo thats how staking and decapitaion works according to jason in this game. so i assume a heart shot would be similar. called shots get wierd. they are gm specific i think
[07/13/19, 2:22:02 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Eva really looked like the Angel over Annabelle's shoulder there
[07/13/19, 2:22:02 PM] <WinterFaery84> @mariacomet Oh, it's ABSOLUTELY first wave.
[07/13/19, 2:22:02 PM] <anderfc> Don't you know i'm loco?

[07/13/19, 2:22:04 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @xxSilentEchoesxx Makes sense, 5th edition just says called shots should mean something other than "more damage." Crippled limb, taking something off, probably less total damage but more of an effect, etc...
[07/13/19, 2:22:04 PM] <geminichild34> Oh if Ib shows up it is going to break Victor

[07/13/19, 2:22:06 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @kronomacchio Greg is a ghoul; still human, has had Nelli's blood, makes him predisposed to agree with her (but not outright mind control) and he gains a small amount of her powers
[07/13/19, 2:22:06 PM] <boldtSketches> With Nellis taste, that makes you wonder what exactly is in this perfume she's selling

[07/13/19, 2:22:07 PM] <highvoltage988> @purgosgaming there's no such thing as a good vampire in the World of Darkness, but these guys are a little less evil

[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <LunarLorkhan> frenzy for Gangrel gives animalistic qualitiies that are very obvious
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <suttonrenee1116> Awwww
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <ModusTrollens69> that is what happens when a gangrel goes into frenzy
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <GryphonCompanion> I know. lol
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <AmondinPC> why on earth do people think werewolf
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <pnutzgg> bwahahahaha
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Oh good it's Jasper

[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> No way this is Karsh, Annabelle would be dead already. And if Karsh were still alive the Beckoning would've gotten him.
[07/13/19, 2:22:26 PM] <MLeeLunsford> No matter what that Gangrel is going to be having a bad night
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <Ziln00bas> what about the blood magic?
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <just_jeri> Jasper is beautiful, how dare you good sir!!!!

[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <sorrelspiral> oof. sorry.
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <Ossborn> KArsh died a couple of years prior to the show, I checked it last week on the White Wolf Wiki
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <boldtSketches> It's not a werewolf, folks
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> Eva didnt look hard at them

[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <Aeriqui> corrosive is the right move
[07/13/19, 2:22:27 PM] <kira858> gangrels and brujahs are the best two fighter clans in the kindred world, this is going to be interesting, especially if the gangrel has fortitude.
[07/13/19, 2:22:28 PM] <tw1zt84> Hungry Team
[07/13/19, 2:22:28 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @onidaimyo Because not everyone is familiar with the lore and Karsh is the only gangrel they know that's Cam?
[07/13/19, 2:22:28 PM] <megjane42> i was trying to remember, have we ever heard nelli's beast before?

[07/13/19, 2:22:30 PM] <deviant_swan> Chaz was worst

[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <Suedyin> @onidaimyo he was incredibly abusive, we've had this discussion already
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <dustykiwi> v i o l e n t l y s h a k e s
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <chaoticloony> @xxSilentEchoesxx yep
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <fleshhy> Chaz knew about Nelli's diablerie and was going to use it against her friends if she didn't go along with his plans
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <Ossborn> @Ziln00bas Yeah, about 500 years til his final death iirc... Lucita on the other hand.... embraced 1150 and still alive

[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <Akeluus> Whatever Afterlife awaits vamps, may it have mercy on Chaz' twisted soul
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <RJLadyA> @onidaimyo Mark meer posted a good riddance chaz on his insta. fun to play deserved to die. it was adorable.
[07/13/19, 2:22:31 PM] <peopleoven> Needs more Jasper.

[07/13/19, 2:22:34 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @onidaimyo he was pretty obviously psychologically abusive (one would assume it's more common than physical abuse among vampires.) Mind you, "domestic abuser" still doesn't warrant death in reality... in the world these characters live in, maybe moreso.
[07/13/19, 2:22:34 PM] <Akeluus> Yeaouch {:P

[07/13/19, 2:22:35 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Yeah, can we not debate whether or not Chaz was abusive enough to deserve death? Some people might have actual real world experience with abuse. Besides, is this really the time for that particular conversation?
[07/13/19, 2:22:35 PM] <GeekandSundry> @sin_x911 not everybody has to be good at everything

[07/13/19, 2:22:36 PM] <burnnt> sure chaz desereved it , but did her "sister" who's soul she ate ?
[07/13/19, 2:22:36 PM] <RagAhroun> Chaz's death wasn't just because he was abusive and a jerk. His death was a message to the Camarilla because he was the Prince's mouthpiece. He was a chess piece that the coterie took out in their game against Vannevar.
[07/13/19, 2:22:36 PM] <kira858> naw victor normally has good rolls when it comes to social, combat rolls though, yeah they're often spotty lol.

[07/13/19, 2:23:14 PM] <phfighter> Does Team Camarilla plan all of this for false sense of victory ?

[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <Raytwist> what ? did it end ?!
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <flashwavexl> @Ronin_LXXIII No he meant that they will fall asleep inside those bags.
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <TOJ8> damn...I need a drink
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I have a bad feeling about this
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <b1ucr0wn> Un-Clench
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <brujahkali> that was intense!
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <batunian> Time to snack on your ghouls and replenish that hunger.
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <kira858> team camarilla probably wants that underground area that jasper has, and used Jasper as a decoy
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <shanearthur1> Yeah. We‚Äôre not even done. That was epic.
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <fkyealemurs> kindred dont breath!
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <DarkestArgentum> !fine
[07/13/19, 2:23:18 PM] <Swoosh2355> it was not suppose to be that easy, but they scared off Rodrigo and the Gangrel was caught off gaurd

[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <deviant_swan> Kinda feel like the Cam might have a backup plan
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @xxSilentEchoesxx Ahh, I didn't remember that. I know Ib is the Sherrif, though, that's why the reference to Chicago threw me off.
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <Raytwist> thanks @JeffM0307
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <Metebelis777> 3 days to Manchurian candidate jasper however
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Everybody, hug a Nosferatu the next time you see one!
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <megjane42> yeahhhhhhh so is there some brainwashing/possession/other weird magic on jasper we should be worried about?
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <ThaDaLinkWent> They were lucky they caught the ivory tower before thwey could fully prepare
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <flowerboyselfcare> how long are breaks usually?
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <Dame_90> Eventful to say the least, now time to get some late night snacks
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <Blackomega20> so @alexander_monster what is that, your 7th out of your 9 lives?
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <Zismarith> Nelli could design a new line of body bags. Possibly etched with . . . gold?
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <gryphangirl> oh ,X
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <tw1zt84> @SorenTheWarrior LUL
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <willsample> if a kindred drinks from a smoker, are they butt-chugging?
[07/13/19, 2:23:19 PM] <AmondinPC> @shanearthur1 Jasper's still in torpor too XD
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <flashwavexl> @Nemisar Good Morgen!
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <PAPerryman> About 10 minutes at most
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <Corrosive_edge> Time to get my other bottle of wine lol
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <lighthawkmaster54> Just do not forget that blood magic that is still on Jasper...
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <flawlessp401> If Jasper isn't full of C4 the Cam went easy on them. Phone call at dusk. Boom. Final Death in front of all his friends.
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <BubbleGumBlood> there is no way they should of scared him off completely that fast
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <DarkestArgentum> Everyone for your own good go get a drink and leave the screen for a bit we all need to decompress cause HOLY S**T!
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <Nemisar> @flashwavexl :D
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> gonna get something to eat
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <Critternation3000> I knew the camarilla should have sent the roomba he'd have taken care of this Baby man and his baby B jcvimKappa
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <boldtSketches> @Nouralogical I hope you have a good Alibi. If so, I hope we get to see her "You had ONE job!" speech
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <fkyealemurs> TOO EZ!? Bro two of them got left behind!?
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <Spunsilver> THat was way too easy
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <shanearthur1> This is the reason I subscribed to LA by Night
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <Ziln00bas> @kingdannythewicked your theory is Ib told Fiarenza who told Victor?
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <PAPerryman> Vamily, get a bite.
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <melkorgoth> Ok, after all that I need a smoke.....and to randomly scream
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @ReginaLight Remember that they were tipped off; the Camarilla's plan was to show that they had Jasper there maybe a half hour before sunrise. They weren't ready.
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <complainthat> @warpedspirit LMFAO
[07/13/19, 2:23:20 PM] <MLeeLunsford> gonna go take a walk after that
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <DevisedDemise> well that was killer on my blood pressure, and i dont feel like it is gonna get a chance to calm down
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <krazyflower> Their timing, supported by their (Chicago friend) was perfect. Nobody would expect a rescue mission right before sunrise.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <Pandaikon0980> I think I made some diamonds watching this.... gandsLessthanthree gandsLessthanthree gandsLessthanthree
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <fleshhy> Bro they were prepared, they scared off the Lasombra and Annabelle started off by frenzying the Gangrel
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <AmondinPC> @fkyealemurs Ignoring the fact the sun is so near, it wasn't half as bad as I thought it might be
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <fkyealemurs> PLUS, we're not done yet. They still need to b retrieved safely.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Excuse me folks, gonna hug a Nosferatu...aka, giving myself a self hug ü§ó
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <flawlessp401> It was part of the Cams plan to have them come close to sunrise.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <fkyealemurs> @Amondin lets see what happens next :>
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <Dragonchrome> !hugs @WarpedSpirit
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <Nightbot> gandsHug hugs @WarpedSpirit. gandsHug
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <tw1zt84> Our boi is safe
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <ReginaLight> @AlhazredsGamingGoo I didn't know that since I have sen chapter four and five for this season. That wasn't going to stop me from watching this though lol.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <sovereign226> fiorenza always helping out makes things so easy :/
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <flawlessp401> C4 execution at dusk.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <webbyghost> we still have half an episode to go and anything can happen, but I'm so proud of our coterie so far
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <sielense> @WarpedSpirit What a coincidence, its national Hug a Nosferatu day.
[07/13/19, 2:23:21 PM] <fkyealemurs> And really, did the Cam expect ARIAL SUPPORT
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Thanks @dragonchrome
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <AmondinPC> @fkyealemurs Rodrigo had two entire rounds to drop down Stygian Shroud and use Shadow Step to get into the helicopter and push everyone out and/or kill the pilot
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <flawlessp401> you can back a ribcage full of c4
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <highvoltage988> I hope after Con season calms down we get Xander back for more X action (and more Cobalt for C6)
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <kira858> yep, that's what happens when you plan effectively. People just wing things and then wonder why their missions are so far, you plan accurately, rolls go in your favor, things go smoother.
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <iknowwhoiamnowdie> Just need to get my PayPal password back and I'm subscribing. The art shots around the my city here with the cast of LA By Night...love it

[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <webbyghost> now I want to know where X is and i can relax more
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <Metebelis777> well execution by sunrise is a cammy object lesson ting
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <BubbleGumBlood> ohhhhh boyyy ima be mad if this is plot armour
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <tiger1833> That was disappointing
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <flawlessp401> packed full of c4
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <peopleoven> Look at that vampire boy smile. üòç
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <mariacomet> the helicopter use was super smart
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <sorrelspiral> aww. rebecc18Hearts4 Jasper
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <BiblioTeq> C4's nice, but Detasheet is fun.
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <bluejones> What ruleset are they using? Just tuned in.
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <megjane42> what we need now is vannevar's reaction to the escape
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> they outsmarted the cam with bodybags
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <fkyealemurs> I think the HELO is what was deciding here.
[07/13/19, 2:23:22 PM] <Suedyin> @kira858 and people follow orders instead of making stuff up at the last moment

[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <Spunsilver> We shall see how this plays out, but I am saying it right now. That was way to easy. I have a feeling there is more to this trap than meets the eye.
[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <fleshhy> yeah don't forget Jasper is still afflicted by whatever blood magic was cast on him

[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <complainthat> @rubythecelticraven naw... they rolled pretty good.
[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @webbyghost X's baron is either on the cammies side or playing or something. but she has removed him for reasons. she just wants to win regradless. so he is "safe". torpor isnt dead.
[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <just_jeri> SO does it count as homebrewing when it is someone from whitewolf doing it?
[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <ShadowGamer264> i wonder if some of this will be in bloodlines 2
[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <poettwist> Victor needs to three up the Prince, though, firebomb the Prince's haven, where ever that is. And by firebomb, bunkbuster it wide open, then pour in naplam.

[07/13/19, 2:23:23 PM] <Dame_90> Things could also go from very good to very bad as well
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Metebelis777> they might need very potent blood to wake him
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Suedyin> true @Spunsilver but I still say it was brilliant acting and writing from all involved
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <USAgent88> Helocopter and all..just feels to easy.

[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <SmilingDays2015> is that the break is over?
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Swoosh2355> Eva and the wierd sisters will have to remove the blood magiks
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <fkyealemurs> I bet his ideas here are just beta testing for official later.
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <boldtSketches> @Nouralogical Indeed....
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <kingdannythewicked> I still think Victor should fill Vannevar with gold. Would be delectable irony
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <just_jeri> putting both Lure of Flames AND Movement of the mind back in without us having them yet, evil.
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <sovereign226> camarilla going after the labyrinth would make the most sense, vannevar switchs priorities after suzanne's episode
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <fkyealemurs> Like the Ghoul mechanics. thats not out yet in 5e, right?
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <BubbleGumBlood> @complainthat not really, it was sort of a situation nearly definately stacked against them
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Spunsilver> @Suedyin Oh no doubt great acting, and great writing.
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <kira858> Completely agree, too many times the prince has gone after Victor, it's time for Victor and the gang to strike back.
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Akeluus> I doubt even Victor has connections with Bomber Jets {:3
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Dragonchrome> Remember when using socials to post art use the hashtag #LAByNight
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <fkyealemurs> so what he's brewing may be used as influence later on in production expansions.
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <Blackomega20> im sure someone missed a trick by not having ghe valkyries, on a helo, playing fide of the valkyries. just saying
[07/13/19, 2:23:24 PM] <kingdannythewicked> to be fair, they did murder his herald
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @kira858 yep time to hit the Camarilla hard
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <boldtSketches> I know this is unlikely, but it would be so awesome if Nelli & Annabelle awake and a wolf would sit in front of them and be loke... "lol, you leeches"
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <payne1221> gandsHype
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @kingdannythewicked that would take a bit of doing. just behead him and grab a roomba lol
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <geekdroid42> honestly, I don't think that was too easy - could easily have been multiple deaths if the rolls had gone bad.
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <pnutzgg> @Blackomega20 I did say this would have been great at the start
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <Suedyin> @Spunsilver and the literary references I think I counted at least 3 maybe 4-5, and dating back to Sophocles (ancient greek tragedian)
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @Sketchblopp I would love that lol
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <SmilingDays2015> bbr
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <LunarLorkhan> well
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <SmilingDays2015> I mean brb
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <LunarLorkhan> unless it hurt them
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <ShadowGamer264> wonder if the nos will rise against the cam now
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <geekdroid42> there were a few tipping points where it looked bad.
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <Hawke089> Hey, does anyone know what happened to Callisto 6?
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <Metebelis777> cave in La and other changing ones
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> Vannevar goes cuckoo for cocopuffs but the part he'll never live down is the roomba
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> @Hawke089 On hiatus for a few weeks
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <boldtSketches> @LunarLorkhan "Ok, now that's a story I want to hear." *chews on a bone like on popcorn*
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <Metebelis777> c6 on season brak til aug
[07/13/19, 2:23:25 PM] <the_wizard_of_disaster> @hawke089 on break till August 9th
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <webbyghost> P L E A S E let Jasper be his normal self and not all jacked up on blood magic
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @ShadowGamer264 the nos are already on victors side. he said they could explore the labyrinth memeber
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Vorthinos> Roomba best part of Vannevar
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Jimersion> Callisto 6 on season break 'til Aug 9.
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <kira858> not really fair, the herald attack first, they acted in self defense
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Blackomega20> @pnutzgg alot has happened between now and then, i clearly missed it xD
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Ossborn> @Hawke089 Dnd In A Castle and Con season... C6 will be back august 9th
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <fkyealemurs> But really...the prince will be PISSED after this.
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Spunsilver> @Suedyin yeah I missed a couple by being away from my computer.
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <bvan_on_twitch> Calisto 6 on break until August
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <sielense> @AlhazredsGamingGoo #accurate #relatable
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Mishoniko> @ShadowGamer264 I wonder how upset the Nos will be that they weren't called in on the rescue.
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Suedyin> @ShadowGamer264 iirc that hinges upon JAsper giving Mister Golden a personal tour of his Labyrrinth and all its secrets
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <fkyealemurs> he might forgo the cams orders of a cold war and make it hot
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <sovereign226> the roomba is the only competent subordinate that vannevar has :(
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <michaeldreamer> shout out from New England Dark Colony
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <Swoosh2355> Vanny will kill someone over this
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <kingdannythewicked> The nos won't care
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <kira858> the prince is going to get his. Either by victor or the beckoning itself.
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <jaguarldy> ok ok breathing how are you holding up Vamily? anyone need hugs? or cookies? or both?
[07/13/19, 2:23:26 PM] <kingdannythewicked> they would have to literally be paid to involve themselves
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <bob_rosser> The heck is this?
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <WarpedSpirit> I wonder how Gary will react to the whole Jasper thing as the Nos are a big family.
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <LunarLorkhan> Vannevar will fill someone with gold over this
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <AstroKicker> Everyone's gonna get filled with gold.
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Suedyin> @Spunsilver without doubt this will bear multiple rewatches... wish I lived in the US to send them a case of cabernet sauvignon LOL!
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Spunsilver> @fkyealemurs He is more insane than a malkavian so when is he not pissed.
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> !wtfisthis

[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Jimersion> I'd love to get hugged by a cookie, please.
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @sovereign226 a useless device for a useless king. his beckoning maddness is reaching its limits. if not for susanne he would be gone by now
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> Prince gonna make them eat golden cake
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Vance1982> i wonder if fiorenza told IB to send that message
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <TheWingedBeatle> @jaguarldy I need a paper bag.
[07/13/19, 2:23:27 PM] <Spunsilver> @Suedyin lol

[07/13/19, 2:23:28 PM] <BiblioTeq> The roomba would make a perfect spin doctor for the Cams.
[07/13/19, 2:23:28 PM] <burnnt> this reacue is great and all but lets not forget the S wakes tonight with knowledge of the leylines and how to weild them.

[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @prismaticfaerie fax some to me!!! the booze should be fine. the cookies might jam the fax tho
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Vance1982> I worried about X
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <iknowwhoiamnowdie> You guys have to get some shots in front of LA's old churches, maybe the Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <kira858> the prince is getting a one way ticket to the beckoning, that's where he's going, he's gone super Saiyan malkavian which is one stage away from the middle east.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Suedyin> I think it is great to see how Belle's character has really blossomed in recent episodes... a teenager no longer
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <GrashUriza> why fill when you can coat them in gold and make them a new hat rack.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Possible that one of the Lasombra may get filled with gandsGold
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <brakutir> Guess who is not going to like tomorrows news...HEHEHEHE
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Aeriqui> i'm having some ciabatta bread with oat milk to calm my nerves

[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <WarpedSpirit> @jaguarldy I was crying so badly. I didn't want Jasper to go...and then fucking me remembered about Mollymauk and everything went to hell.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <xxSilentEchoesxx> @kira858 oh hes already beyond that. i think susanna is compelling him to stay. why he keeps looking at her all the time
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <kira858> I know right, Prince is going to flip himself out into torpor lol.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Vance1982> X :(
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <FaraLeGros> X coming to you bastLUL @vance1982
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Metebelis777> and on ok terms with the builder of the labyrinth.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <sovereign226> @xxsilentechoesxx what if she's doing the same thing to him that she did to nelli but the beckoning is too strong
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <Swoosh2355> Suzanna would feel it as much as Vanny
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <kira858> @xxSilentEchoesxx Agreed, she's really the only thing keeping him here but she's only a 14th-17th gen, she can't keep that up for long.
[07/13/19, 2:23:29 PM] <sorrelspiral> @WarpedSpirit bryandHug
[07/13/19, 2:23:30 PM] <tw1zt84> I was hoping those caves would lead to whats under the park

[07/13/19, 2:23:30 PM] <Suedyin> indeed @Metebelis777 now that was a lore dump I did NOT see coming
[07/13/19, 2:23:30 PM] <iknowwhoiamnowdie> Wait, who built the labyrinth?

[07/13/19, 2:24:19 PM] <krazyflower> Oooooooof
[07/13/19, 2:24:19 PM] <shidareAKI> that lighting change
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <Onairic> Could Nelli? Considering she has diablerized someone she's gotta have a higher potency
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <shidareAKI> noice
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <RJLadyA> Oh sh...

[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> Mr Jason Carl and these guys at G&S are the perfect match for creating atmosphere
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <Ziln00bas> @razahphon fair
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <FaraLeGros> so... Jasper is really stong
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <krazyflower> Eva did that all the way back at episode 1.
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <fleshhy> So eva and jasper are the same generation?
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <recursion2501> jasper stronk
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <Metebelis777> tremere and climbing the pyramid
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <boldtSketches> Now that's interesting
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <Suedyin> yes it was a long time ago, we've all had a busy year

[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <DaftPunkPlayingAtMyHouse> lol greg
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> Nelli diablerized someone who was the same generation, it was for spite, not power
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <GrashUriza> naw, the Minstry is freakkng aweeome. they are not cam.
[07/13/19, 2:24:20 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @onairic Nelli's victim was her own generation and made after she was, very unlikely she would've gotten stronger blood from it.
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <Metebelis777> nelli?
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <DaftPunkPlayingAtMyHouse> greg is a joke name now
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <BubbleGumBlood> JEST SAY THE GEN
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <burnnt> eva is house Carna , so no pyramid
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <jkinslayer> wait wouldn't she also know he's committed diablerie
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <BiblioTeq> Call Gary Golden. Anything's negotiable.
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Well, *if* Eva is Strauss' childer, then that makes her 8th gen. So that would mean that Jasper is 8th as well.
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <Ziln00bas> "give me dice"
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <tiger1833> Labyrinth

[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> But jasper awoke Eva during anaheim?
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> Pretty sure Eva was not sired by Strauss
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <boldtSketches> holy shit
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <recursion2501> yikers that dice pool
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <megjane42> @jkinslayer I was wondering that
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <RagAhroun> Generation and Blood Potency are divorced in V5. Generation is lineage, Blood Potency is age/strength.
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> allright (shit)
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <fkyealemurs> yup
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <andy_lnas> LUL greg your are actually the safe one
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <krazyflower> @GryphonCompanion WE have confirmation that she's directly from Strauss and not one of his own kids?
[07/13/19, 2:24:21 PM] <just_jeri> Eva clearly, no bond issues there
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <burnnt> shes sayin hes blood potence 2 her sorcery pumps her to 3 , annabelle isblood potnecy 1
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Blackomega20> sassper in with the powerful bloodline. guess thats what happens when you drink exclusively kindred
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Akeluus> Y, U, Greg. He eet u ;P
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <webbyghost> Man if Jasper reacts the way Nelli did, we may be treated to an Alex Scream
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <fkyealemurs> now they done it for each other
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Metebelis777> how greg got his undeath on
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> !wtfisthis
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. Surrounded by enemies and uncertain allies, the coterie races against time to rescue Jasper from the Final Death.
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <JackalopeLARP> also, it's based on Blood Potency, not straight generation, in V5
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <GeekandSundry> @burnnt or it was back in Season 1
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Dragonchrome> !roleplay
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> @webbyghost And growling!
[07/13/19, 2:24:22 PM] <Vance1982> that grin
[07/13/19, 2:24:23 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @jkinslayer he didn't commit true diablerie to take the other vampire's soul and power, she probably can't tell that he just drained the other guy to death.
[07/13/19, 2:24:23 PM] <shidareAKI> that's a chonky roll
[07/13/19, 2:24:23 PM] <Shadowringa> that's love
[07/13/19, 2:24:23 PM] <vcolev> jasper Yelp time!!!!
[07/13/19, 2:24:23 PM] <cinphoria> @RagAhroun soooorta divorced. your blood potency _potential_ is determined by your generation

[07/13/19, 2:24:25 PM] <razahphon> yay for joey
[07/13/19, 2:24:25 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> blood potency also means that Therese isn't X's sire like Victor wondered awhile back, he'd be at least 3.
[07/13/19, 2:24:25 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Blackomega20 that's a good idea, but they won't remember that... nor do they know his gold thing anyway

[07/13/19, 2:24:26 PM] <kira858> I'm pretty sure Jasper is blood potency 2, when he blood surge, he only added one dice to his roll.
[07/13/19, 2:24:26 PM] <strous1> Sitting to get put into makeup for hours is how he can be that way here.
