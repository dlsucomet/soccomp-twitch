[07/20/19, 2:11:53 PM] <sielense> I love how the Vampire the Masquerade stuff is all supposed to be a contiguous universe, regardless of media. That means the ads are canon. Especially in the flashback, which means vampires had cloud technology during the french revolution.
[07/20/19, 2:11:53 PM] <twitchcraft36> @melkorgoth how different you think the story would be if melkor/morgoth made the ring instead of sauron?

[07/20/19, 2:12:25 PM] <Celador_Mythica> @JCVIM - Lignin, which is present in all wood-based paper, is closely related to vanillin. As it breaks down, the lignin grants old books that faint vanilla scent.
[07/20/19, 2:12:25 PM] <firehea1995> yeah coz someone is messing with his mind

[07/20/19, 2:12:45 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[07/20/19, 2:12:45 PM] <MissNayoung> Come to think of it my Gangrel, Shiina Gado, was all too aware of that. Her sire was also her adopted father and a mercenary before being turned. He taught Shiina everything he knew about combat.

[07/20/19, 2:13:02 PM] <Ziln00bas> At first I wondered why Fiorenza‚Äôs courier was set to wait until a specific time to give his message, and not an ASAP kind. Eventually I thought it was because too soon and Jasper would not have even been set up there yet. Was that why, @vampiresnvino ?

[07/20/19, 2:13:05 PM] <ImALadyDangIt> @guitarfan7 Similar, in that it's also a tabletop roleplaying game, but different rules and a modern setting.

[07/20/19, 2:13:05 PM] <vampiresnvino> @RJLadyA Most of it lives in my head, but I make a few bullet points.

[07/20/19, 2:13:18 PM] <WinterFaery84> NO!!! NOT Strauss!!
[07/20/19, 2:13:18 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Strauss is a shadow player. He lies in wait.
[07/20/19, 2:13:18 PM] <BiblioTeq> Yeah, no, either of those would be worse.

[07/20/19, 2:13:19 PM] <Hellhound732> I thought Strauss dislikes being in the position of that high power
[07/20/19, 2:13:19 PM] <boldtSketches> Well, Strauss said he doesn't long for those kind of titles in BL1, but that was some time ago
[07/20/19, 2:13:19 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Strauss as Prince would be..interesting, but I don't believe he'd want the role

[07/20/19, 2:13:26 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[07/20/19, 2:13:31 PM] <RagAhroun> The labyrinth has nothing to do with the Garou, or at least with the BSDs. It's a construction from Zelios the Architect, a Nosferatu.

[07/20/19, 2:13:35 PM] <RecorderEvans> To anyone unfamiliar with the clans, Tremere are the closest to being a Wizard or a Sorcerer in DnD.

[07/20/19, 2:13:35 PM] <Ziln00bas> Can someone remind me what artifacts/relics Victor had one of his guys driving around just in case?
[07/20/19, 2:13:35 PM] <Kandogar> roombas are taking over the world

[07/20/19, 2:13:44 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Fiorenza is an alternative obsolete name for Florence. During the Middle Ages, the city was called Fiorenza.

[07/20/19, 2:13:48 PM] <dogplayingpiano> The dangers of Friendship is probably this chronicle's unofficial motto
[07/20/19, 2:13:48 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> I hope Fiorenza IS in on it, because if Ib is playing it alone, Victor just blew it.

[07/20/19, 2:14:10 PM] <twitchcraft36> Is jasper wearing his execution thing from anaheim? Notice that he's black and eva white. They're still referencing the stones so I wonder how much the storyteller has prepared in advance. X had a vision of strauss a season or two ago
[07/20/19, 2:14:10 PM] <GeekandSundry> Remember we are back next week, Season 3 has 9 eps!
[07/20/19, 2:14:10 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @kgn86 There's one more this season

[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Swoosh2355> Id love to see the Coterie expand to include X and Eva full time
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <GryphonCompanion> Aye. @Celador_Mythica I just thought they were "wiped out" :)
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <just_jeri> Do got to love that the cast for this episode are the main Camarilla clans tho, they are all the V5 version of Antitribu ;)
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <legendaryratboy> @twitchcraft36 Old clan refused to accept Viscissitude and relies on old sorceries, New are the Fleshshapers.
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Nemisar> or Dragon could just do it :P
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I really want to see some antitribu eventually
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <GeekandSundry> Remember we are back next week, Season 3 has 9 eps! (and of course epilogues after)
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @sarahgabriella84 worth noting that it's partially disbelief as well, the normies have a hard time processing vampires as being real, the sourcebook says that most non-religg
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Metebelis777> An old calm Tizi would make for a nice anarch got ya
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <itchigo513> I had a friend who played a Tzimichi that turned "useless" ppl into chairs so they would serve a purpose

[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <Spunsilver> @shanearthur1 you should also check out Sagas of Sundry it is amazing!
[07/20/19, 2:14:13 PM] <vampirequeen29> I feel like I‚Äôm being exposed to new and exciting tabletop RPG I never heard or experienced

[07/20/19, 2:14:14 PM] <highvoltage988> my LA By Night drinking game was last week. The rules were "down an entire bottle of wine to deal with the stress of Jasper's rescue, spend the next day with your worst hangover in 10 years"

[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <GeekandSundry> Some casualty reports may have been inaccurate. Only Kasey survives? With Syc torped.
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Suedyin> I would attempt writing up the Chronicle of these nights... but by Caine, the body language subtleties and acting skills are WAY beyond my ability to convey on the page
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <pekoe212> @CeeTeeBee88 yes don't let that term die, ahahaha
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <Swoosh2355> Syc is still in torpor

[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Here sire is on the way?
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <tw1zt84> This is just like thor 3
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <thirdtrickster1> why is Sycorax still in TORPOR
[07/20/19, 2:14:20 PM] <ObsidianDragon86> WOO!

[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <kaeleakae> #savesycorax
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <RecorderEvans> There's no idea when Syc will wake up from torpor either. So she's effectively out of action.
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <legendaryratboy> oh boy, elder Gangrel in the house
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <CainTheConfused> Gods, I love the intensity she brings to Kasey.
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <onidaimyo> Can anyone fill me in on what happened since 8 pm?
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <GeekandSundry> Syc's getting out or torpor by way of her sire... who we haven't met yet... apparently.
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Dokka78> be proud they are riding to Valhalla.
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Swoosh2355> #IblameCarver
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Sire is getting involved
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <webbyghost> geez I didnt know it was this bad for the valks
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> seems like your fangs are itchy @jcvim
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <boldtSketches> @thirdtrickster1 I suppose Kasey is not strong enough to wake her up
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <vcolev> feel bad for the valkyries, but if they couldn't handle one lasombra, then they probably not that strong of an ally....
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <vampirequeen29> I‚Äôm curious to heard who her sire is
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <onidaimyo> Still no Nines around yet right?
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> imagine if sycorax's sire is beckett
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @onidaimyo They met up with Gary Golden to exchange info, Nelli told the coterie about Daffodil's mistake, and Victor and Fiorenza talked about the friend from Chicago, and she told them about Ib's "promotion".
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <Critternation3000> @tw1zt84 good catch
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <sovereign226> @vcolev D:
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> Lot of people getting dragged into this
[07/20/19, 2:14:21 PM] <JCVIM> @ceeteebee88 nah just hearing about that shadow bitch itching me the wrong way
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <rigslee> the valkyries are gangrel ?
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <onidaimyo> Kasey sounds kinda whiney honestly.
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Misanthrope_D> Ok I am starting to believe these Lasombra are waaay overpowered
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Your_Local_Doggo> I just got back, did Eva and Jasper kiss?
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <boldtSketches> @AlhazredsGamingGoo Oh this would be awesome
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <GeekandSundry> @Sketchblopp @thirdtrickster1 or her wishes are not to be bonded to Kasey, she's requested her sire before she went down
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <sovereign226> not helping victor
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Dragonchrome> #ShadyLady
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <RecorderEvans> @vcolev Anyone would get fucked up super hard by a surprise Lasombra attack.
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <onidaimyo> The Cam would of come for the Valkeries eventually anyway
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Misanthrope_D> Like they're toying with everybody, including the prince
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Celador_Mythica> Syrocax is Gangrel
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Suedyin> good to see you again @onidaimyo :)
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Shagri Some gangrel some brujah
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Swoosh2355> Syc is a gangrel., Kasey is Brujah
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <boldtSketches> @GeekandSundry good point
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Hellhound732> Aurora must be a really low generation, and incredibly old to have the strength she does
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <kaeleakae> @Shagri Sycrorax is. They're a faction unto themselves
[07/20/19, 2:14:22 PM] <Kandogar> no they didnt kiss... but there where VERY close to

[07/20/19, 2:14:23 PM] <legendaryratboy> I wonder if Brunhilde had any hidden Childer who may have led to Syc....
[07/20/19, 2:14:23 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> @jcvim least shes not a shadow ditch?

[07/20/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Dragonchrome> @twitchcraft36 probably after the epiologues
[07/20/19, 2:14:23 PM] <Dokka78> shoulda chose celerity :)

[07/20/19, 2:14:35 PM] <onidaimyo> I think Tremere can do something. Gargoyles have a thing where they can stand perfectly still and take no sunlight damage if they make roles for it.

[07/20/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Swoosh2355> @phfighter the taste of the blood can give some sort of bonus to the Vampire
[07/20/19, 2:14:40 PM] <onidaimyo> He can still take it consensual of course but seems most blood he'd take wouldn't be consensual. Likes to jump scumy criminal types

[07/20/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Suedyin> @Ziln00bas that's how I read it
[07/20/19, 2:14:44 PM] <ObsequiousDiphthong> V5 seems to bring about a lot of judgement on other people's feeding quirks
[07/20/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Rhaitus> @GeekandSundry makes sense. I can assume by how slow Bailey is healing that he hasn't been ghouled. But that he is trusted as both a driver and with Kindred life for obviously feeding Eva
[07/20/19, 2:14:44 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> we dont judge you @jcvim the 60s were rough jcvimSweat

[07/20/19, 2:14:44 PM] <GryphonCompanion> My Tremere does like to pop the painkillers, on top of feeding on those taking the drugs. A tad different, but still ^_^

[07/20/19, 2:14:45 PM] <JCVIM> @smidsy609 RIGHT

[07/20/19, 2:15:01 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> @onidaimyo Raufoss rounds are meant for anti-material rifles. this pistol does not even exist in reality because there's no inquisition to make it. the only pistil that can fire a raufoss round is single shot and was not mass produced.

[07/20/19, 2:15:13 PM] <Rhaitus> @Myladyfarangis I get that. At the same time (and keep in mind I haven't heard the con episode yet) if Chloe is Eva's ghoul and Jasper loves them both than it seems so long as Eva is okay with such things it would likely work out. Granted ghouls can get rather...possessive...

[07/20/19, 2:15:20 PM] <jayy15951> I don't think Eva has ever frenzied before that's really impressive
[07/20/19, 2:15:20 PM] <ObsidianDragon86> Is it bad I REALLY want to play a Malkavian who treats his beast like a long lost friend? "Oh HEY! You're back! 8D"
