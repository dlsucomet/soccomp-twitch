[07/27/19, 7:06:41 AM] <captaincronch> i love u guys
[07/27/19, 7:07:16 AM] <DriveFrew> We're certainly a fun bunch : )
[07/27/19, 7:08:12 AM] <Danoba> We do have a good time.
[07/27/19, 7:08:51 AM] <captaincronch> thank u for talking to me, a big fan
[07/27/19, 7:09:21 AM] <Danoba> We appreciate the fandom, it means a lot to us.
[07/27/19, 7:09:42 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry Is there some sort of resolution issue? It keeps cutting off the outer frame of the game's video.
[07/27/19, 7:10:25 AM] <cinphoria> I think the screen got fitted into the whole canvas area instead of the area within the overlay?
[07/27/19, 7:10:44 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry I can't see the captions at ALL during cutscenes, which is incredibly difficult for me, I have issues hearing.
[07/27/19, 7:12:52 AM] <GeekandSundry> @John_Sparks_Jr Apologies for clipping the captions, it should improve as we move the overlay around during the show
[07/27/19, 7:13:10 AM] <Danoba> @John_Sparks_Jr Unfortunately, we can't adjust it as this is a playback of yesterday's episode but we'll adjust it for the next time we play this game. Or what G&S said.
[07/27/19, 7:13:48 AM] <GeekandSundry> Appreciate the note, we'll definitely fix it : )
[07/27/19, 7:15:37 AM] <John_Sparks_Jr> @GeekandSundry @Danoba Cool. To be honest, the border just reduces screen use, so, personally, I think it's... unnecessary, if you want any preference.
[07/27/19, 7:16:12 AM] <cinphoria> oh god the eyes
[07/27/19, 7:16:14 AM] <cinphoria> why
[07/27/19, 7:16:37 AM] <Danoba> We, of course, had no idea what was being green-screened in at the time.
[07/27/19, 7:16:48 AM] <Danoba> So all of this was a surprise to us after the fact.
[07/27/19, 7:16:52 AM] <TrueSly1> @cinphoria cus RanDoM!

[07/27/19, 7:26:20 AM] <manny_for_president> I came from youtube for L.A. by Night and I'm considering subscribition. Could somebody kind enough answer a question or two? I'm a bit lost
[07/27/19, 7:26:29 AM] <swiftfingers> thanks back @DriveFrew and @Jelas
[07/27/19, 7:26:41 AM] <Danoba> @manny_for_president How can we help?
[07/27/19, 7:27:18 AM] <swiftfingers> @manny_for_president feel free to ask
[07/27/19, 7:28:07 AM] <manny_for_president> 1) So apparently there was a special episode at some sort of a festival. Is it possible to watch it at all? Or was it not recorded?
[07/27/19, 7:28:24 AM] <Danoba> @manny_for_president Do you mean the WonderCon episode?
[07/27/19, 7:28:36 AM] <manny_for_president> I... guess?
[07/27/19, 7:28:41 AM] <swiftfingers> it might be on youtube
[07/27/19, 7:29:14 AM] <manny_for_president> Hmmm. Didn't see it. Oh well
[07/27/19, 7:29:15 AM] <cinphoria> The WonderCon episode should be available as a podcast.
[07/27/19, 7:29:22 AM] <cinphoria> It is NOT on YouTube.
[07/27/19, 7:29:42 AM] <manny_for_president> @cinphoria, thanks a lot
[07/27/19, 7:29:44 AM] <swiftfingers> my bad
[07/27/19, 7:30:09 AM] <swiftfingers> thanks for the accurate information @cinphoria
[07/27/19, 7:30:14 AM] <cinphoria> np! It should be the last episode in the feed, after the Season 2 episodes
[07/27/19, 7:30:51 AM] <Danoba> @manny_for_president So far it only exists as a podcast.
[07/27/19, 7:31:31 AM] <Danoba> http://labynight.geekandsundry.com/
[07/27/19, 7:31:44 AM] <manny_for_president> 2) Are there any twitch-exclusive videos other than an early access for newer episodes?
[07/27/19, 7:32:09 AM] <Danoba> @manny_for_president Yes, certain shows like TBD RPG only live on Twitch.
[07/27/19, 7:32:12 AM] <manny_for_president> @Danoba , wow, thank you so much!
[07/27/19, 7:32:19 AM] <swiftfingers> a good postcast is still really a sweet experience imo
[07/27/19, 7:32:34 AM] <cinphoria> ooooo I missed the switch the an aquarium
[07/27/19, 7:32:42 AM] <cinphoria> WASP <3
[07/27/19, 7:33:01 AM] <Mech45> Mech45 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! wooo!
[07/27/19, 7:35:09 AM] <Danoba> @manny_for_president I believe there might be a couple of VODs that aren't on YouTube but everything usually is windowed out.
