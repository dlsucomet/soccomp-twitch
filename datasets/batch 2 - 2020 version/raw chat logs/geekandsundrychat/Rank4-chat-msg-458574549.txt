[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <teboz89> love archaangle
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <MLeeLunsford> Are we canon?
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <ctphipps1980> Chicago by Night 5E is the only thing as good as LA by Night for 5E
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <FrassySass> I love these radio bits, they remind me of The Deb of Night from Bloodlines
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <kaeleakae> Archangel gettin meta on us
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <geminichild34> @thisjus10 I dont think it is Becca
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <webbyghost> Oh good i made it
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <jessicaamado> @RavenWolfe had to butcher the quality, to 180p BibleThump
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <georgebynight> more important than who Archangel is ...is how does sheknow all this stuff
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <karen86> @cold_moon23 6 epilogue episodes
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <ctphipps1980> I bet Archangel is Chloe--can't imagine why
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <kefneji> “No one likes v5” isn’t accurate. Plenty of people do, they’re just not as... vocal as those who hate it are ;)
[07/27/19, 2:12:25 PM] <Vance1982> a secret prince of LA, maybe?
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <geminichild34> @ctphipps1980 And the Losmbra are amazing
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <teboz89> oops sorry love ArchAngel
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Emaleyne> Hi @webbyghost
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <ArisBranwin> Yes this show is full canon in the Vampire lore..
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <recursion2501> is archangel the campbell sister?
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I hope we get a Mage 5e
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <highvoltage988> maybe my ears are bad but Archangel doesn't sound like Becca to me at all
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <loveturtles> inb4 the archangel reveal, maybe it's fiorenza?
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <just_jeri> Why would you wish ANYONE was there, LA seems like a horrible place to be at the moment
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <Swoosh2355> Chloe makes sense as Jasper hid from her and she wants to help others that think they lost their persons maybe?
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <RavenWolfe> ty @prismaticfaerie did nto know will try to look at that
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <megjane42> the try-hards part reads like fiona to me, which makes no sense but...
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <ctphipps1980> Jason Carl is in charge of V:TM for Paradox so, yeah, I think he can declare what he wants canon
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <geminichild34> @Alexanderhero83 I think we are getting one for Mage and Werewolf but no clue as to when
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <54aquasnakes> any guesses on who Archangel is???? I know
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <suttonrenee1116> Just got here what did I miss??
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <cthol24601> Love v5. the hunger dice mechanic adds so much colour to play
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Alexanderhero83 There will be eventually, but Werewolf is coming first.
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <YokeDatOneBloke> What about triple secrets?
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <aechonex> secretception
[07/27/19, 2:12:26 PM] <flashwavexl> @ctphipps1980 Chloe is Archa -angel because she was a Journalist student before Fiona took her.
[07/27/19, 2:12:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> IB.. oh no

[07/27/19, 2:12:29 PM] <flashwavexl> @geminichild34 yeah sure she is. She always wanted to uncover mysteries - watch JasPer epilogue where he spies on her.
[07/27/19, 2:12:29 PM] <just_jeri> @Zismarith Yeah but your haven blowing up in the middle of a Vampire war can be a bit of a turn off ;)
[07/27/19, 2:12:29 PM] <RavenWolfe> ok thank you @prismaticfaerie
[07/27/19, 2:12:29 PM] <achuakscale> Does this coterie have a name? Or is it just The Vamily?

[07/27/19, 2:12:30 PM] <Ossborn> It´s both the name for the coterie and the shows fans
[07/27/19, 2:12:30 PM] <sorrelspiral> @twitchcraft36 no, unfortunately.

[07/27/19, 2:12:31 PM] <poettwist> If the stream is jerky, try lowering the quality. That may help.

[07/27/19, 2:13:12 PM] <nifelfang> Jasper feeding on only vampires are the thing i find most unlikely. LA as a big city maybe have, what, 50-100 vampire. jasper would need to feed on a vampire once a week at a minimum, probobly 2-3 to stay sated.

[07/27/19, 2:13:14 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> There's three possibilities I can think of straight from 5th edition for Jasper: he has the (expensive) blood bond immunity merit, he has the 2 dot Carna loresheet that allows one to resist bloodbonds with a check, or he's been bonded to someone he doesn't feed from since before episode 1 and we don't know it.

[07/27/19, 2:13:15 PM] <nifelfang> @legendaryratboy ok, but in a year, jasper would have to feed on a vampire around 52-156 times. imagine the amount of enemies he would have by now. not to mention him being a diablerist risk in the extreme

[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <CeeTeeBee88> wonder if they can lock the mirror and cut the lasombra off from their powers
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <boldtSketches> Oh, are they going to Paris now?
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <BiblioTeq> I wonder if Nelli's g-g-grandfather was the one who showed the caretaker the location of the labyrinth when he traveled to the New World?
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <Ziln00bas> Take 1 drink (sip or quaff) whenever: @vampiresnvino (Storyteller/Jason) Makes a note -or- says "Victor my boy." @cyndancer (Nelli G) Says a conjugate of "fuck". @casonova (Greg) Says "blank bodies". @bdavewalters Victor texts Campbell -or- makes someone "forget all about this". #LAByNightDrinkingGame
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <willsample> A mirror bridge to Castle d'Ombro?
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> what is that torpor nosferatu has to do with all of this?
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <sielense> Watch them accidentally summon a wraith
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <BuffaloVal> Has Eva gained some of her color back? That was part of the curse that was on her that her color was taken from her?
[07/27/19, 2:13:33 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @Swoosh2355 I don't know why, but that made me laugh out loud. Just imagining Jasper ending up in Paris... "I have no memory of this place.."
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <RJLadyA> @sketchblopp 😂😂

[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <Dragonchrome> but who is the key master?
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <fkyealemurs> Lilith is the "Mother" of Kindred. She was gifted dark powers by Lucifer when she left eden, then taught Cain how to use his powers when he got cursed by god. Its interesting, as this is how blood discipline started....so what is kindred...God's curse or Lucifer's gift?
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <Akeluus> They unlock the Mirror... a bunch of sports equipment suddenly falls out
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <PAPerryman> You know what that key reminds me of? ... It reminds me of the Babe.
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <legendaryratboy> I'd guess it opens the pathway to New York... and you don't want to go to Zelios's place under NEw York...
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <doubleforte> He is the Key and the Gate
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <Hyperdryve> what episode is this?

[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <willsample> 'Jasper, when someone asks you if you are a god, you say yes!'
[07/27/19, 2:13:34 PM] <TheUncommonNerd> The Latin's actually a bit off I think. Imperial shadow would be "Tenebrae Imperiales".

[07/27/19, 2:13:41 PM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. Difficult and dangerous choices face the coterie as they struggle to stay one step ahead of their enemies.

[07/27/19, 2:13:41 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
[07/27/19, 2:13:41 PM] <HavePig> Have the Weird Sisters bring over a pizza, too.

[07/27/19, 2:13:55 PM] <AlhazredsGamingGoo> The way we keep getting reminded that Sycorax's sire exists but there hasn't been a name makes me think there's a non-zero chance it's Beckett. Of course, it's MORE likely it's just someone we've never heard of so a name is meaningless, but still, non zero chance it's Beckett.

[07/27/19, 2:14:02 PM] <Rhaitus> @oldschoolboy2k would be a fun twist. But Victor has referred to Ib as his friend from Chicago to Fiorenza last episode. So the odds are higher that he is speaking of Ib, not 100, but I would say at or over 80

[07/27/19, 2:14:04 PM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[07/27/19, 2:14:23 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I didn't realise just how much my own Tremere was starting to resemble Jasper and Eva until tonight. And I am having some emotions about it.
[07/27/19, 2:14:23 PM] <botanarchy> wouldn't he get bloodbound to his victims and then not want to hurt them?
[07/27/19, 2:14:24 PM] <cinphoria> @flashwavexl the rats, even though they're useless

[07/27/19, 2:14:24 PM] <twitchcraft36> you know this reminds me, if you're a vampire, drinking bad people might also go to a sense of purpose or doing good for the world. if you're immortal you need that sense of purpose to stay sane
[07/27/19, 2:14:24 PM] <Swoosh2355> Eva trying to rationalize it in her mind now?
[07/27/19, 2:14:24 PM] <highvoltage988> @appu123y yep

[07/27/19, 2:14:27 PM] <doubleforte> @twitchcraft36 because Jasper can only feed from kindred
[07/27/19, 2:14:27 PM] <highvoltage988> @Hyperdryve there are different "diets" or preferences in 5th edition. Most eat from humans, but can eat from other vamps too. Jasper needs to eat from other Vampires
[07/27/19, 2:14:27 PM] <Swoosh2355> He just did tell you....
[07/27/19, 2:14:28 PM] <WarpedSpirit> At least Jasper was HONEST

[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <twitchcraft36> @doubleforte why can jasper only feed on kindred?
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <geminichild34> ANd Jasper is at 4 Hunger... this is definitely not a good night for him!
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <WinterFaery84> I mean, Eva didn't tell Jasper about her addiction
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <JeffM0307> Hey @Babrooster

[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <krazyflower> I think Annabelle may be the closest to a "good" person. And the longer she remains, I fear her optimism will burn out.
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <andy_lnas> oh his beast love drinking EVA tea LUL
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <LEBuwu> JeffM0307 jcvimHi
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @twitchcraft36 I think it has to do with how much Jasper hates what he has become and his dislike for other kindred in general. He believes they are all monsters, so he turns the "bad" mortals into monsters. Probably helps rectify it in his mind.
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <USAgent88> @twitchcraft36 if only all he was doing was drinking from them...he's turning them and then drinking from them. It's bad. It's bad for the masquerade. Also what if he's wong about them? worse.
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <kaeleakae> Preferable? Oye vey
[07/27/19, 2:14:29 PM] <legendaryratboy> this is why you don't feed from loved ones!

[07/27/19, 2:14:30 PM] <boldtSketches> 4 hunger and wounded and on the way to a dangerous situation where only his friends are close. What could possible go wrong?
[07/27/19, 2:14:30 PM] <paladinelmo360> eva does not look happy
[07/27/19, 2:14:30 PM] <sielense> As a water vampire, I relate to this situation 100%

[07/27/19, 2:14:32 PM] <RecorderEvans> There's just too much shit happening to you and that you're forced to do to be "Good."
[07/27/19, 2:14:32 PM] <kaeleakae> Oh? Black rabbits!
[07/27/19, 2:14:32 PM] <krazyflower> I feel like Kyoko and Annabelle should get along together.

[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <sielense> You can be good, prejudices are a societal problem that require Vampires to act shady in an example of catch-22. They aren't evil for doing a thing that requires them to survive as long as they try their best??? idk, Neutral Good For Lyfe
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <kaeleakae> Hi I'm Jasper - welcome to my crib

[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <Hyperdryve> i have no idea whts going on with a game without dice but this is pretty fun
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <BiblioTeq> Jasper's starting to lose it a bit.
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <Swoosh2355> I mean who doesnt know about the power in the Park?
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <appu123y> @Dragonchrome bryandLUL
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <flashwavexl> Jasper should learn Dominate - control the Herd instead of cage them.
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <legendaryratboy> that transparent face when all your secrets are out...
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <Blackomega20> Jasper going full "everyone out of mah swamp"
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Jasper needs a snickers
[07/27/19, 2:14:34 PM] <bigsam58> Vtm cribs lol
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <Rhaitus> Just a reminder to the Vamily. Domain rules apply, and while Victor may be Baron in Jasper's Haven his rules are Supreme.
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <RecorderEvans> I mean, I certainly try to be "Neutral Good." But sometimes, you're gonna do bad things and try to justify it as "Good."
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <gotthemminerals> snickers lol
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <kira858> Eh not entirely, it really depends upon how the player wants to play, the whole role of a kindred trying to reach golcinda (increasing humanity) is a kindred trying to be a good guy. It just that most players don't play that way.
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <willsample> Jasper doesn't need dominate. He obviously has presence-- at least for Tremere women to follow him into dark places.
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <Akeluus> What is Jasper's Hunger at now?
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <Zismarith> Just about break time.
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <BiblioTeq> And a *slightly* warped door.

[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <HavePig> Give them a home tour, Jasper. "Through this door is the rumpus room."
[07/27/19, 2:14:35 PM] <FrassySass> those side looks Eva keeps giving Jasper are painful. She's sooooo mad....

[07/27/19, 2:14:39 PM] <legendaryratboy> oh, that is true, Zelios 5 dot gives you a double roll on Rouse checks, so Jasper feeds less frequently than other kindred.

[07/27/19, 2:14:39 PM] <kira858> @Blackomega20 Different strokes for different folks, that's the good thing about VTM 5e now. If you wanted your kindred to attempt to reach higher in humanity, you could.
[07/27/19, 2:14:39 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Jesper can Feed on Rats
[07/27/19, 2:14:39 PM] <georgebynight> if I'm not mistaken the salubri have been wiped out by the Tremere
[07/27/19, 2:14:39 PM] <Somber777> Eva is going to offer herself so he can stick to primarily feed on kindred without all the captives
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @Alexanderhero83 he should!

[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <FrassySass> Mostly wiped out :) There are a few left.
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <ArisBranwin> It's all fun and games.. until it's not.
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Jonin1> Really digging this episode
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <RavenWolfe> but who's not a monster then
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I prefer to think of my character, at least, as trying her best to not be a monster. She tries... She really, really tries.
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Dragonchrome> Hi @strous1

[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <paladinelmo360> just had a thought.. Jasper is kinda doing what the sabbat were doing in Bloodlines 1. I bet half the ppl he turned the eat didn't even know they were vampires
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <willsample> the DA material touches on why the salubri fell, and why they too, were just monsters with good PR :)
[07/27/19, 2:14:40 PM] <Blackomega20> @kira i mea , i do kinda like the thought of telling a V5 chronicle as a hopepunk story as opposed to the dark spiral of doom i must admit
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Rhaitus> Isn't it that the Salubri have strictly limited their numbers to survive at this point? I remember reading that somewhere
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <ArisBranwin> No theres been 3 if not 4 salubri that were full Goldconda.
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <FrassySass> And I believe there's some suggestion that the diablerie of Saulot by Tremere failed and it is actually Saulot in control of his body.
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <ArisBranwin> There are only *maybe* a hand full of Salurbi left.
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Myladyfarangis> @onidaimyo about the monster statement, all are not monsters, but the beast is a monster and it is within all kindred
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Dragonchrome> and for those that missed it, there will be ^! epilogues this season
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <LunarLorkhan> All Kindred are monsters, however it's up to them to decide if they want to fully give in to their monstrous nature or try to fight it to the best of their abilities, knowing they will never get it 100% right
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Dragonchrome> how cool is that!
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Alexanderhero83> I am Excited for Monday and Tuesday.
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <ArisBranwin> And Tremere diablorized Salubri..
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <Dragonchrome> 6 epilogues
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <megjane42> it's all going so well and everyone is getting along and even jasper is willing to concede to not hating everyone and I am just waiting for the other terrible shoe to drop
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <legendaryratboy> @Rhaitus yep, 7 who each diablerize their Sire every time.
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <ArisBranwin> And now Tremere is in someones body...
[07/27/19, 2:14:41 PM] <strous1> the Tremere, smiles a toothy grin At @Dragonchrome :P
[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <ArisBranwin> p.s. Sorry for Spoilers.
[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <gotthemminerals> @paladinelmo360 relationship goals can Jasper become vegan?

[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <bludrk_returns> @Dragonchrome HOW DO YOU KNOW???
[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <ArisBranwin> Not all diablerize their sires.
[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <sielense> @FrassySass That is always a possibility with an Antediablarie, yes
[07/27/19, 2:14:42 PM] <PAPerryman> Fill them with Golconda.

[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <ArisBranwin> Yes and no depending on how you read it.. and who's in what body where.
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <FrassySass> I read somewhere that an associate of Beckett's also killed one of Saulot's childer before she could teach him the secrets of Golconda.

[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Myladyfarangis> Let's just all agree Jasper made good on a bad feeding situation
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Somber777> it's a false logic, I don't feed on people, I feed on Kindred, but I turned people into Kindred so that I can feed - just cuz you added a step doesn't change the fact you are still indirectly feeding on people
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Tonight is the Final episode for Season 3
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Blackomega20> fill them with Crinos form claws

[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <PAPerryman> But wait! G&S will be having a marathon of LA by Night Season 3 ALL WEEKEND!
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <ArisBranwin> Since Annabelle needs to *meet* the other clans.
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Dragonchrome> !backblaze
[07/27/19, 2:14:43 PM] <Nightbot> Backblaze is unlimited, cloud backup for Macs and PCs! backblaze.com/labynight
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <legendaryratboy> @Somber777 welcome to VTM, where everyone;'s a hypocrite!
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <sielense> Jasper used his best judgement, hard to fault him for that.
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Dragonchrome> woot @PAPerryman
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <novaoastra> if i see a salubri im gonna lose it LUL
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Zismarith> Cooooool.
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <nihilissa77> if they are running v5 they won't show up
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <twitchcraft36> you know i wanted to play giovanni and salubri but could never get th ose blasted mods to work on bloodlines only clanquest worked
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <DakuBara> 6 Epilogue Episode, im excited!
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <ArisBranwin> They might.
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Next week is going to be Legend l
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <ArisBranwin> They had Werewolf.
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Somber777> @legendaryratboy hah, indeed
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <Dragonchrome> nice
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <novaoastra> @twitchcraft36 mods? PogChamp
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <flowerboyselfcare> 🧐
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <paladinelmo360> no doubt what Jasper did makes sense... its still kinda fucked up but i get it
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <gotthemminerals> Anabelle off doing the 'and my axe' routine
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <gundammac0311> @alexanderhero83 ooo?
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <georgebynight> I would definitely play a salubri look at all the healing that would be able to do these people are really good at getting injured
[07/27/19, 2:14:44 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @onidaimyo As am I. Very intrigued with how they've done his preference, considering the V5 limitations in the corebook.
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <DakuBara> OH btw if anyone know can you tell me who played Amethyst on the Wondercon Live Show for LA By NIGHT!!!!
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Alexanderhero83> Werewolf game would be Fun
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <sielense> Jasper probably could have just staked them and never fed them, then feed indefinitely?
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <twitchcraft36> yeah mods for the bloodlines pc game
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <doubleforte> v5 seems strange to me, there are so many clans left out
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Dragonchrome> shouold be coming back from break soon folks
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <ArisBranwin> Would you be an Obeah or Valerean?
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <zanemalara> lol i use to have a nos character by the name of ratboy
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Metebelis777> werewolf worked best with umbra based stuff or body horror metis TBH
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Dragonchrome> stat bringing it back in
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Myladyfarangis> I'm ready for a Mexico City campaign if we're gonna talk about Fiorenza this much.
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <LunarLorkhan> I would love this cast and crew to do Werewolf the Apocalypse!
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <WorldJumper2> I know it's not gonna happen, but as a Mage fan, I just want some Awakened mortal to interact with the vamily. Won't happen, but I can dream.
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <boldtSketches> It's interesting that there are only 4 players around at a finale. But I guess Eva still counts as guest
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Dragonchrome> can the sisters be quiet?????
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <willsample> @sielense = they have to have blood in them for him to feed on
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Dragonchrome> w'll find out
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <doubleforte> here's a hint: no
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <Hyperdryve> thuluLWING gandsDrink thuluRWING
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Seriously though, why is Eva mad?! Jasper told the truth. Yeah, it's fucking awful, but at least he isn't lying anymore.
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <legendaryratboy> Seriously though, is Jasper going Bahari!?!?
[07/27/19, 2:14:45 PM] <kuroiryu009> @Dragonchrome that's a no
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Rats808> @WorldJumper2 i 100% agree, that'd be great
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <RavenWolfe> Amethyst was Amy Vorpahl I believe
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Dragonchrome> ow common, Kyoko might be stealthy in a huff to prove a point
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Myladyfarangis> @WorldJumper2 Look if the inquisition tech keeps getting weirder Technocracy help is not out of the question
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <ArisBranwin> because what Jasper is doing could get him killed if caught.
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @WarpedSpirit well it's such an extreme way of feeding she understandably wants him to stop
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <zanemalara> @WorldJumper2 i could see an soe showing up at victors club as a dj
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <twitchcraft36> bahari?
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <gundammac0311> @alexanderhero83 hopefully X and Jasper start a dance crew
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <FrassySass> I dunno, I'd be pretty pissed. A bit of processing time would be required to find out my boyfriend sires humans and then eats them.
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <AjninKon> @WarpedSpirit you have to admit that its pretty shocking though
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <ArisBranwin> It's that "Oh shit he's doing that.."
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <gotthemminerals> @LunarLorkhan werewolves not swearwolves
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <Hyperdryve> he does amazing creepy
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <DakuBara> Anyone know who Played Amethyst on the Wondercon Live Show????? Anyone know if they will ever publish video for it or just the podcast?
[07/27/19, 2:14:46 PM] <paladinelmo360> @sielense they would eventually run out of blood. its like drinking from a water bottle without refilling it. eventually, u will run out
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <phfighter> Can anyone in chat precisely explain what jasper is doing in his lair ? I missed the 1st part of his reveal
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <nihilissa77> because he lied to her at first. he was not truthful from the beginning and she had placed trust in him
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <mariacomet> but @WarpedSpirit, he lied to her. Period. That is a violation of trust. She can chose to forgive it and move on but still...
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @WarpedSpirit For lying in the first place. And he's taking a life every time he feeds. For most kindred, at least, they don't kill at every feeding. But because he embraces them, that's it.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Metebelis777> vamps are just tass in people form to most mages. old ones really dislike tremere, and are ok with "ministry"
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <PAPerryman> While I would love a Werewolf game, I'm with Eric Campbell on desiring a Changeling game.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <BiblioTeq> @WorldJumper2 I've played a Son of Ether; I'd love to see a Mage of any stripe here.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <legendaryratboy> @twitchcraft36 a cult that worships Lilith instead of Cain as the 1st Vampre; they have a tendency to eat their own Childer.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <WarpedSpirit> @ajninkon Not really. Jasper understands that he is a monster. He truly is.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <sanitarium33935> werewolf and kindred alliance should be a good thing
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <WinterFaery84> Hey, Eva didn't tell Jasper about her preference to drug soaked blood.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <sgbee816> Oh Jasper, what have you done (sigh)
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @gotthemminerals lol
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <ArisBranwin> I'd like to see Pookas.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <prismaticfaerie> @DakuBara I'm not sure who played Amethyst, but they video for the WonderCon ep had some technical errors, so there is only the podcast.
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Nemisar> @onidaimyo nobody said that
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <Dragonchrome> just the podcast @DakuBara
[07/27/19, 2:14:47 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Remember folks, vampires ARE monsters
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Dragonchrome> are they tho?
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Metebelis777> not set it modern day woudl be nice...late 60-early70s for changeling can work well
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <doubleforte> @onidaimyo you like to pick a lot of fights
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <LunarLorkhan> @WarpedSpirit agreed
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <georgebynight> obeah lay on hands yes please cure madness etc
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <ArisBranwin> No, humans are the real monsters. Vampires/Kindred are just a product of that.
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <zanemalara> could be wrose he could have started out with who they found was there.
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <AjninKon> @WarpedSpirit Jasper does yeah. And we as viewers know. But Eva just found out . It takes time to process.
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <mariacomet> I think for Eva, it's not ONLY forcing the feeding but forcing the change. And then forcing the feeding for a long period of time All of it is taking away their will multiple times.
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <FrassySass> Jasper must have Convictions about that otherwise he'd have so many stains. The Embrace itself causes stains, yes?
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Myladyfarangis> Changeling games and Wraith games are two ends of the mind F* in WOD for me
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <sielense> But they are monsters with feelings!
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Somber777> Jasper should add more levels of difficulty and only feed on gold stuffed scourges going forward
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Embrace your monster!
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <highvoltage988> @PAPerryman why not both? I'd love if G&S could do a whole WoD megaverse with crossovers and everything, but that's a lot of work and a lot of shows and there's only so many hours in the week
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <Dragonchrome> break should be ending folks
[07/27/19, 2:14:48 PM] <ArisBranwin> In any case people, be ready.. its about to come back.
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Metebelis777> wish v5 got away from judeo stumbling block from core 1
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <PAPerryman> lol Why not indeed @highvoltage988 !
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <PAPerryman> :D
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <flashwavexl> @prismaticfaerie He should have some haven set up with weak nosfearatu he treats as a herd. Not caged. then he could 'get away with it'
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <WarpedSpirit> Literally, give your inner monster a hug...and then some blood. All will be good!
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Dragonchrome> let's see how this goes down
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Jonin1> I am ready
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Metebelis777> Sun songs shoud be req reading for game devs
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <georgebynight> if this is the finale I hope they show what's going on with vannevar and get to take on Aurora
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <PAPerryman> Fingers and toes crossed.
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <doubleforte> Kyoko Bones It
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <michaeldreamer> what happened to Jack? from the la by night book, and the video game.
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <legendaryratboy> I be talkin bout Bahari and Zelios and shit, no problems here :)
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Blackomega20> @dragonchrome imma guessing "tragically"
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <kuroiryu009> !breathe
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Nightbot> Breathe kuroiryu009, don't forget to breathe!
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I mean, Eva may have her preference for addicts, but at least she asks consent. I think her main issue with Jasper's preference is the taking against their will.
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <DakuBara> SAD FACE really wanted to see a live show, I wanna see Amethyst again! She was a great Character
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <Dragonchrome> Kyoko is doing fine until obnoxious ringtone
[07/27/19, 2:14:49 PM] <WarpedSpirit> If I was a vampire, I would be a literal monster. I know for a fact
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <brakutir> It has been a real good episode thus far..
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <ctphipps1980> I think it's more the MASS MURDER element of Jasper
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <mariacomet> That's my take too @prismaticfaerie
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Alexanderhero83> !breathe
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <WorldJumper2> I just know the Technocracy is behind the Second Inquisition, so a technocrat is not out of the question. A DJ Cult of Extacy would be rad too, though. Honestly, I don't care who or how. I just want it to happen.
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <flashwavexl> @Gleonard001 aren't all the actors off at all the big summer events right now?
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <zanemalara> jack more then likely is taking a break after the death of the last prince
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Vance1982> B Dave the only other man who can look down on Travis
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Swoosh2355> back
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <AjninKon> I think the main problem is changing mortals. Eva was very against the changing of Chole during S2 Epilogue 4
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Alexanderhero83> !whodat
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Nightbot> GM Jason Carl ( twitter.com/vampiresnvino ), with Alex Ward ( twitter.com/AlexWard777 ), Cynthia Marie ( twitter.com/Cyndancer ), B. Dave Walters ( twitter.com/BDaveWalters ), Josephine McAdam ( twitter.com/JCVIM ).
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Blackomega20> @dragonchrome *sneak...sneak...sneak...carly ray jepsen really loud*
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <FrassySass> woot
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <georgebynight> yeah prob
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <willsample> the whole 'what Jasper is doing is a capital crime in all kindred societies' aspect may be in play with her concern.
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <legendaryratboy> gandsGold gandsHype gandsGold
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <nihilissa77> game on!

[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <Dragonchrome> hahahaha @Blackomega20 I can see it
[07/27/19, 2:14:50 PM] <megjane42> I think a lot of Eva's problem is that he lied

[07/27/19, 2:14:52 PM] <prismaticfaerie> I didn't see anyone get upset. Just propose different opinions and theories.

[07/27/19, 2:16:26 PM] <RecorderEvans> @oldschoolboy2k To be fair, shit is moving FAST. And if they didn't destroy it, Strauss would have destroyed them.
[07/27/19, 2:16:26 PM] <doubleforte> @oldschoolboy2k only because he didn't know what would happen, and wanted to find out himself

[07/27/19, 2:16:36 PM] <krazyflower> Do you all trust Strauss??
[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <CraigOxbrow> I saw them supporting Jayne Jonestown in '97.
[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <boldtSketches> @flawlessp401 what makes you think that?
[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Don't trust him, Victor

[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <fleshhy> Strauss is a tightend about customs I think
[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <georgebynight> its not a truce its a struce
[07/27/19, 2:16:37 PM] <Ronin_LXXIII> Strauss is actually honorable

[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <Uileat> wonder how much Victor can back that up
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <tw1zt84> an ex?
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <archytas> Does Eva have asthma or something? The breathing is confusing.
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <gotthemminerals> Strauss goes anarch? - make it so
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <prismaticfaerie> Oh, I cannot wait for the epilogues.
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <tommygunangels> :-D
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <Myladyfarangis> double dammit
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <Blackomega20> @geekandsundry @prismaticfaerie "now on vocals, strauss with a dedication of 'she f*****g hates me' to eva"

[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <CainTheConfused> Undisputed champion of cover stories
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <tommygunangels> Straiss would never go Anarch. He's Cam through and through.
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <RavenWolfe> ohhhh boooy
[07/27/19, 2:16:38 PM] <BiblioTeq> Epilogue fodder just spilling out like shadows.
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <fleshhy> pretty solid deal from Strauss
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <kira858> when are the epilogues?
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <sgbee816> Coming and going but NOT DURING
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <krazyflower> That's at least 3 epilogue hooks in the past 10 minutes.
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <ElrictheSorcerer> Strauss is CAmmy to Final Death, BUT he's not loyal to princes if their actions are detrimental to the Tower
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <DracoMoon777> Strauss is giving them a good deal.
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <oldschoolboy2k> sounds like a nice epilogue for Nelli G
[07/27/19, 2:16:39 PM] <chaoticloony> !points @BiblioTeq
