[08/10/19, 7:09:50 AM] <BriDanann> @shidareAKI hey Aki!!!
[08/10/19, 7:09:55 AM] <highvoltage988> @umarlt it's not about winning or losing, but about telling a compelling story
[08/10/19, 7:09:59 AM] <shadowjr630> yes...i just happen to catch this episode!!!!!
[08/10/19, 7:10:02 AM] <shidareAKI> @umarlt this is a roleplay game, it's not really about winning. it's cooperative story telling
[08/10/19, 7:10:02 AM] <Nemisar> @umarlt if you are playing/experiencing it, you are already winning
[08/10/19, 7:10:03 AM] <ImALadyDangIt> @umarlt If you tell a great story, you win. :D
[08/10/19, 7:10:05 AM] <shidareAKI> !roleplay
[08/10/19, 7:10:05 AM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.

[08/10/19, 7:10:08 AM] <Nightbot> Callisto 6 takes place in Los Angeles in the year 2119, where a world of cyberpunk is about to be broken by the emergence of superheroes. Powered by the Cypher System, this original RPG is crafted by Eric Campbell and Sam de Leve.

[08/10/19, 7:10:30 AM] <DeLevely> The way you win Callisto 6 is catching all the Pokémon and making all the enemies your friends.
