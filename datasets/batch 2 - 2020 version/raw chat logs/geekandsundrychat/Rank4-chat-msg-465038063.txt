[08/10/19, 10:10:48 AM] <Nightbot> Callisto 6 takes place in Los Angeles in the year 2120, where a world of cyberpunk is about to be broken by the emergence of superheroes. Powered by the Cypher System, this original RPG is crafted by Eric Campbell and Sam de Leve. Synapse is on the loose and the team must act quickly if they are to stop the speedster before he hurts anyone... including himself.
[08/10/19, 10:11:09 AM] <Suedyin> oops no this is not Callisto 6, that finished earlier lol
[08/10/19, 10:11:13 AM] <DJPheonyx> @Suedyin You may have heard his voice, since he has done a lot of voiceover work for aniimation and video games.
[08/10/19, 10:11:43 AM] <Suedyin> this is Sagas of Sundry Dread, where the survival horror mechanic uses a Jenga tower

[08/10/19, 10:12:22 AM] <cinphoria> A group of five friends get together for a summer camping trip. But this isn't an ordinary camping trip - they're going to the same place they went on last year's trip... a trip that involved horror, sorrow, and dread.
