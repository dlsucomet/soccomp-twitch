[08/10/19, 11:05:58 AM] <willsample> @JCVIM: the upside to the Lasombra joining the Camarilla is that the Tremere will at least have useful puppets instead of Ventrue :D
[08/10/19, 11:05:59 AM] <Vonmorrison_of_WoW> Things got a "little" out of hand, LOL.

[08/10/19, 11:06:41 AM] <Nightbot> Led by Storyteller Jason Carl of White Wolf Entertainment, L.A. By Night is a dark tale of personal horror and inhuman conspiracy that sees four vampires doing their best to navigate the macabre affairs and terrifying realities of surviving the L.A. night. The demands of barony weigh on Victor as he takes advantage of the truce.

[08/10/19, 11:06:50 AM] <Dragonchrome> !roleplay
[08/10/19, 11:06:51 AM] <Nightbot> What you are seeing is a role-playing game played with dice. This is collaborative storytelling where people take on a character, and improvise a story as that character. They will occasionally roll dice to see if they succeed or fail at certain tasks.
