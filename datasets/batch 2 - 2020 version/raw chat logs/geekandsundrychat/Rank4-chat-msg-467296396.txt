[08/15/19, 7:50:11 AM] <Nightbot> Can you handle the Terror? On this episode of Game the Game, Becca is joined by Phillip Correa, Paula Deming, and Jason Charles Miller to play Terror Below from Renegade. A government experiment has gone horribly wrong, and now giant mutant worms are running amok across the Nevada desert! This video is made in partnership with Renegade Game Studios. Learn more about Terror Below here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/165626423/terror-below?ref=14gx7l
