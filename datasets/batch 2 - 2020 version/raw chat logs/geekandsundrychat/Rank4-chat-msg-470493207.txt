[08/22/19, 7:14:27 AM] <Nightbot> Get your catnip and scratching post ready, because in this episode of Game the Game we're playing Cat Lady from AEG! Ivan Van Norman is joined by Rachel Kimsey, Vince Caso, and Erika Fermina to decide who is the most devoted feline fan. Players must draw cards to collect cats along with food, toys, costumes, and other kitty accessories. Accumulate the most points to be the victorious Cat Lady!This was made in partnership with Alderac Entertainment Group. https://www.alderac.com/cat-lady/
[08/22/19, 7:14:43 AM] <astylepixie> @davecom3 when a game is hosted by Ivan it’s hard for it to NOT become horror haha
