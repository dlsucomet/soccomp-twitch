[09/11/19, 7:01:10 AM] <chaoticloony> Hi @Zaister
[09/11/19, 7:01:11 AM] <Nightbot> We have a subscriber-only Discord server! Join here: https://discord.gg/geekandsundry (you'll need to sub and link it to your Twitch) and be a part of the fun!...Warning: It can take up to an hour for the server to update and give you access to the channels
[09/11/19, 7:01:12 AM] <Elfteiroh> :O
[09/11/19, 7:01:13 AM] <shidareAKI> !ido
[09/11/19, 7:01:13 AM] <Nightbot> We would like to remind everyone that marriage takes communication and work, and is not just about physical appearance. In order to love someone enough to marry them, knowing them in person is important. You can definitely #LessThanThree everyone here classily though, and they will #LessThanThree you back!
[09/11/19, 7:01:57 AM] <super390> Well, it's still military service, you're just now The Resistance.
[09/11/19, 7:01:58 AM] <chaoticloony> Just remember that although many of the hosts of the channel are attractive, there's much more to them than that. For example, Gina is also incredibly creative.
[09/11/19, 7:02:03 AM] <shidareAKI> I arrived just in time both to watch most of the episode (I have to hop out early again today) and to be assailed by doggos in need of pets.
[09/11/19, 7:02:06 AM] <FuffyButt> to many words
[09/11/19, 7:02:09 AM] <Nightbot> Help G&S make great content! $4.99/month gets you emotes, Minecraft server access, sub-only VODs, and more! Every sub keeps the channel alive! twitch.tv/geekandsundry/subscribe

[09/11/19, 7:03:19 AM] <chaoticloony> Most mayors in RPGs are either fools or crooked
[09/11/19, 7:03:19 AM] <shidareAKI> I have one sitting next to me on the couch right now. He has been having tummy issues, so unfortunately, he's had to fast today and he is a sad pupper.

[09/11/19, 7:05:38 AM] <TheEmbiggenedBadger> Oh jeez, I totally didn't realize my sub had expired. That would explain why G&S didn't appear for me on Discord anymore.
[09/11/19, 7:05:40 AM] <TheEmbiggenedBadger> Ah well.
[09/11/19, 7:05:52 AM] <Ossborn> And I miss Aleika... the new owner sends pictures every 2-3 days and each of them makes me happy and sad at the same time! I miss that girl!
