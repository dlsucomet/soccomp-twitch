[10/8/19, 11:00:40 AM] <prismaticfaerie> Will I be at a significant disadvantage if I've only seen about half of the first episode?

[10/8/19, 11:02:11 AM] <sweeetanj> ARRRTTT
[10/8/19, 11:02:12 AM] <Mysterioso888> is this related to any other campaigns
[10/8/19, 11:02:22 AM] <VinceCaso> @Mysterioso888 Nope!
[10/8/19, 11:02:22 AM] <prismaticfaerie> lmao, pretty much @notalwaysweak
[10/8/19, 11:02:37 AM] <VinceCaso> @Mysterioso888 It takes place in the We're Alive universe, but is standalone
[10/8/19, 11:02:41 AM] <phoenixgoth> I still have no idea how he makes those sounds.
[10/8/19, 11:02:53 AM] <bear_wonder> it is associated with the podcast of We're Alive
[10/8/19, 11:03:04 AM] <VinceCaso> @phoenixgoth he apparently practiced a lot in the car, lol

[10/8/19, 11:03:17 AM] <prismaticfaerie> @phoenixgoth Black magic fuckery, pretty much, is my best guess
[10/8/19, 11:03:17 AM] <Mysterioso888> ok i have trouble keeping this all straight in my head, i thought this might be related to that other outbreak campaign
[10/8/19, 11:03:26 AM] <Xanderrific> Get that raildriver going!!
[10/8/19, 11:03:29 AM] <snort_cigs> who is the guy second from the right?

[10/8/19, 11:08:03 AM] <VinceCaso> Was about to say, the art makes these scenes all the better
[10/8/19, 11:08:07 AM] <notalwaysweak> It's beautiful art.
[10/8/19, 11:08:08 AM] <KaiOrAya> Would love to see an art book of G&S RPG art
[10/8/19, 11:08:12 AM] <azoie> NO FUCKING WAY
[10/8/19, 11:08:17 AM] <whatdoyoubelieve> artoFace artoCity
[10/8/19, 11:08:18 AM] <sweeetanj> @KaiOrAya YES!
[10/8/19, 11:08:24 AM] <sweeetanj> Look at that rail driver?!?!?!?!?!
[10/8/19, 11:08:25 AM] <sweeetanj> Wow
[10/8/19, 11:08:30 AM] <ArisBranwin> Who do we bribe for an art book?
[10/8/19, 11:08:40 AM] <notalwaysweak> I never noticed before it has 'knock knock' on the sleeper car door.
[10/8/19, 11:08:51 AM] <notalwaysweak> If the sleeper car's a rockin'....
[10/8/19, 11:09:01 AM] <KELVAEN> ooo I love Anjali
[10/8/19, 11:09:07 AM] <VinceCaso> @notalwaysweak ...then it's probably zombies
[10/8/19, 11:09:08 AM] <phoenixgoth> The art is done by Kent Bagman
[10/8/19, 11:09:25 AM] <phoenixgoth> * Davis, I'm sorry, my brain is weird
[10/8/19, 11:09:43 AM] <ArisBranwin> Braiiiiins...
[10/8/19, 11:09:47 AM] <phoenixgoth> @vincecaso accurate.
[10/8/19, 11:10:03 AM] <KaiOrAya> Heck with enough warning, I'd totally make the drive down to see a G&S art and set exhibit at a museum
[10/8/19, 11:10:03 AM] <ExcessiveWarlock> Lefty!
[10/8/19, 11:10:09 AM] <notalwaysweak> I'm a fan of the whiteboard.
[10/8/19, 11:10:16 AM] <phoenixgoth> @kaioraya same!!!
[10/8/19, 11:10:19 AM] <VinceCaso> Wait Mel is left-handed??
[10/8/19, 11:10:31 AM] <ArisBranwin> Need more white board
[10/8/19, 11:10:34 AM] <phoenixgoth> ... you're JUST noticing? Lol
[10/8/19, 11:10:38 AM] <notalwaysweak> Her handwriting is so neat!
[10/8/19, 11:10:39 AM] <Xanderrific> shoot@evillady(.com)
[10/8/19, 11:10:51 AM] <phoenixgoth> Her handwriting is so good
[10/8/19, 11:10:53 AM] <VinceCaso> @phoenixgoth As a lefty I have a bizarre amount of lefty-blindness
[10/8/19, 11:11:01 AM] <notalwaysweak> @Xanderrific I'd look that website up but I'm afraid to
[10/8/19, 11:11:14 AM] <bear_wonder> it would take asher that much time to notice that
[10/8/19, 11:11:18 AM] <Xanderrific> @notalwaysweak me, too
[10/8/19, 11:11:19 AM] <phoenixgoth> Awww, that's adorable, my dad is a lefty too @vincecaso

[10/8/19, 11:11:46 AM] <phoenixgoth> @kinteoka about 11 mins
[10/8/19, 11:11:50 AM] <VinceCaso> @Kinteoka You've hardly missed anything
[10/8/19, 11:12:05 AM] <notalwaysweak> @Xanderrific it's someone's blog not updated since 2014 (I had to check)
[10/8/19, 11:12:09 AM] <Kinteoka> Is this the continuation from the episode they released today on youtube???
[10/8/19, 11:12:13 AM] <sweeetanj> We're just here trying to kill infected and RUN FOR OUR LIVES
