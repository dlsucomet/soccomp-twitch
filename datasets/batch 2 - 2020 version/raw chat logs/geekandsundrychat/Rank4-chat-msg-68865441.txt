[05/27/16, 11:56:09 AM] <IRW9394> when are they starting?
[05/27/16, 11:56:12 AM] <willingblam> My money is in Pike
[05/27/16, 11:56:12 AM] <zazra> Pike has a 70HP heal at her disposal, don't forget about that one
[05/27/16, 11:56:14 AM] <asp0o0kyghost> I reckon Percy will burn his action surge and try to kill Kiki or pike straight away
[05/27/16, 11:56:15 AM] <m121akuma> s'break y'all

[05/27/16, 11:56:19 AM] <Trogaf> if Percy does hex first on keyleth game over
[05/27/16, 11:56:19 AM] <TriGGer961> Cleric won last time
[05/27/16, 11:56:21 AM] <DracorianAmanda> @Picasso2k8 Ther'e's a battle royale tonight :)
[05/27/16, 11:56:24 AM] <liquid_lightning> Yay looks like i got back in the nick of time
[05/27/16, 11:56:25 AM] <MrWetTaco> yea true, if they all gang up on keyleth because they know shes the strongest....then it will be hard for her to win
[05/27/16, 11:56:25 AM] <sallysparroww> Go Keyleth!
[05/27/16, 11:56:26 AM] <pirikos> if vax can do a sneak attack it will be kind of unfair for one player :p
[05/27/16, 11:56:27 AM] <treypylon> gandsTrinket
[05/27/16, 11:56:27 AM] <jwfschultz> marisha go rock elemental
[05/27/16, 11:56:28 AM] <OrionSilverhelm> So you all think that pike might actually cast a spell outside of her 3 spell reperatoire?
[05/27/16, 11:56:32 AM] <augrae> @Quantumnaught it's episode 13 in escape from the underdark I believe
[05/27/16, 11:56:33 AM] <Spidey426> Sneak attack-if an enemy of the target is within 5 ft
[05/27/16, 11:56:34 AM] <walrus_fist> If it was Girls Vs Boys Girls would win hands down
[05/27/16, 11:56:35 AM] <Quiet_Wraith> woot
[05/27/16, 11:56:39 AM] <swaggy27uk> has anyone looked at Fownes Brewery yet?
[05/27/16, 11:56:39 AM] <Tenken1989> If they have 7th level spells keyleth will be a problem with her fire spell. But i think percy will be at disadvantage cause he uses his guns. Vax is idk unknown. But Pike is a power house for sure :D She has the highest AC i think
[05/27/16, 11:56:40 AM] <Bob_Biac> Talisan's critical skills will prob mop the floor if loam doesn't dagger dagger dagger every1.
[05/27/16, 11:56:41 AM] <Aldjeron> oooo

[05/27/16, 11:57:24 AM] <GammaLiz> Too bad they never made a sequel.
[05/27/16, 11:57:30 AM] <thandr> in this battle.. if it is a free for all i believe pike and keyleth are a little OP
[05/27/16, 11:57:34 AM] <TvKirk142> If Keyleth goes elephant form she would have 76 hp and still have a second wild shape which could be elephant again
[05/27/16, 11:57:35 AM] <Kryand> sunbeam + earth elemental and she wins
[05/27/16, 11:57:36 AM] <Tenqu01> still haven't gotten may's box :(
[05/27/16, 11:57:46 AM] <kylekasson> @Caculbert...just depends on if she uses her powers well...I think she'll do well but I'm still sure that percy will have this.
[05/27/16, 11:57:46 AM] <Mahkay14> My dice ring got cancelled.

[05/27/16, 12:02:35 PM] <khitey> Any chance of getting a side shot of the layout? Hard to tell which models are who
[05/27/16, 12:02:41 PM] <MrWetTaco> @Geekandsundry Can we get the loot crate ad off the screen so we can see the map and the players better?
[05/27/16, 12:02:42 PM] <Timitor> I hope they use the dice roller
[05/27/16, 12:02:43 PM] <Aloucia> GO PIKE! *POM POMS!*

[05/27/16, 12:03:11 PM] <liquid_lightning> Once per turn, not per round. He could use his reaction. Also no it isn't it's a free action it's how he dagger dagger daggers
[05/27/16, 12:03:15 PM] <TomaHock84> Can you turn the music down and the players up?
[05/27/16, 12:03:16 PM] <Favelava> For reference: Percy is Blue, Kiki is green, Pike is yellow, Vax is purple

[05/27/16, 12:03:43 PM] <Sheogorath_Of_The_Isles> WHAT!? Low light! That's handicapping Percy!
[05/27/16, 12:03:45 PM] <cruzemissile8> cant you sneak attack twice if you have three attacks and use the second as a feinting strike
[05/27/16, 12:03:47 PM] <vastcat> Kill percy first round
[05/27/16, 12:04:00 PM] <xdrfiredogx> Gotta think Kiki has the upper hand if she plays it right. So much tanking she could do.
[05/27/16, 12:04:08 PM] <pizs> are your dongers ready for some pay back for vex? Kappa

[05/27/16, 12:05:42 PM] <khornite> He musta rolled like a 35 or 36.
[05/27/16, 12:05:44 PM] <HallJama> Vax usually rolls 30s on stealth
[05/27/16, 12:05:44 PM] <Bob_Biac> and he walks away

[05/27/16, 12:05:55 PM] <Magestrike> wouldnt that have been his bonus action which he used to activate the boots?
[05/27/16, 12:05:55 PM] <saltnbeans> i would just turn into an earth elemental and hide LMAO
[05/27/16, 12:05:57 PM] <uberbaldy> I ahve a feeling the first thing Vex would have done was the hunters mark her brother
[05/27/16, 12:05:59 PM] <DeathToTrinket> and staying true to character Vax walks away
[05/27/16, 12:06:00 PM] <Akeeba1st> there Vax goes, bending time and space again
