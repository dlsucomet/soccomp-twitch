[09/30/16, 1:36:08 PM] <OrganicArtist> @uberbaldy you acted like a whiner in whisper, and i had the decency to talk to you there, you have not admitted you were wrong and so i can take it back here if you'd like.

[09/30/16, 1:36:23 PM] <thatghostie> no its the one that was today
[09/30/16, 1:36:24 PM] <RavenWolfe> nope tonight
[09/30/16, 1:36:24 PM] <OrganicArtist> @uberbaldy you made a rule, punished someone who didn't violate what you had said, and now are pissy that someone is pointing out your own *** stinks too.

[09/30/16, 1:36:30 PM] <Xaotices> @LTman86 "working" would be debatable. most people were having sync issues. I turned it off because it was buffering constantly

[09/30/16, 1:36:34 PM] <Ravager> 5 minutes in?

[09/30/16, 1:37:15 PM] <drekfletch> @NL_Stormyknight the sync issues came from twitch, not from the studio. Their recording is find.
