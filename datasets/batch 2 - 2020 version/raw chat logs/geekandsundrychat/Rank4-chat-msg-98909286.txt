[11/4/16, 10:17:24 AM] <uberbaldy> @SharVoss No, it isn't and Alpha will likely be the quickest end to CR.

[11/4/16, 10:17:27 AM] <LightningGemini> bye chat! gonna watch without the rolling text!

[11/4/16, 10:17:28 AM] <RossWarlock> twpHYPE
[11/4/16, 10:17:29 AM] <CorenDuchai> reason for the video glitches are probably because it's being dualstreamed to f'ing alpha
[11/4/16, 10:17:29 AM] <SabercyTV> how much does alpha cost
[11/4/16, 10:17:29 AM] <WTFWJoshD> gandsSCANLAN
[11/4/16, 10:17:30 AM] <erdtirdmans> they could have sold alpha better. it's not bad for them to have a subscription service since it will enable more content, but they've only sold it thus far as this vague annoying paywall

[11/4/16, 10:17:31 AM] <TrainerJodie> No, it's Alpha's fault. I can't say how I know, but I'm pretty certain it's Alpha's fault....
