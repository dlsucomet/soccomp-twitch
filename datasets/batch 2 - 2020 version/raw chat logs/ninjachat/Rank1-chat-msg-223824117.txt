[01/30/18, 11:09:13 AM] <RyceNL> @xxmancouchxx depends, you're basically using an advanced controller since you translate controller movements from keyboard/mouse, so technically you don't get more or less than anyone else.. just refined and better customisable

[01/30/18, 11:10:18 AM] <xxmancouchxx> @RyceNL yeah i guess thats true, but its still a huge advantage as you can be so much more swift and accurate with a keyboard and mouse than you can be with thumbsticks.(yes ik im basically repeating what i already said lmao)
