[02/13/18, 4:17:38 AM] ** Maddened Ninja reads subs between games and as he can. He tries REALLY hard not to miss any, but he will inevitably miss one sometimes. You should be subbing to support the channel, not for a shoutout on stream. He is very grateful for every sub I promise. ninjaH ninjaAdore
