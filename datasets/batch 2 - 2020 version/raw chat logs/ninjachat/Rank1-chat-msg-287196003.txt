[07/21/18, 8:17:56 AM] <Crisr25> solo squad i want to see this ninjaPopcorn ninjaPopcorn ninjaPopcorn
[07/21/18, 8:17:57 AM] <Kemli> Truth @WhaleXO
[07/21/18, 8:18:00 AM] <The_Joker916> Can someone tell me if he lost already or what happened?
[07/21/18, 8:18:02 AM] <anxietyaddict> True was killed by a hacker
[07/21/18, 8:18:03 AM] <1tylergodwin> How do I subscribe on the app
[07/21/18, 8:18:05 AM] <WhaleXO> Either have console and pc separate or include them in the same lobby
[07/21/18, 8:18:06 AM] <RSMisto> @WhaleXO exactly, these kids who are 5 games in with 130 points are just playing the worst of the worst console players lol
[07/21/18, 8:18:09 AM] <BradyBoy1367> It's highly likely ninja gets top 20, I'm pretty sure top 20 gets 10k at least
[07/21/18, 8:18:09 AM] <kylealderete11> Tourney
[07/21/18, 8:18:10 AM] <SEYindeed> @maad_man88 he got 140

[07/21/18, 8:18:25 AM] <WhaleXO> I’m not saying one is better than the other. But they are different. THats a fact
[07/21/18, 8:18:27 AM] <visnagforfuniv> @whalexo yea
[07/21/18, 8:18:27 AM] <BiggRigg64> if you honestly think console and pc are the same theres no point and even talking to you. I run into maybe 1 person per game who builds on console
[07/21/18, 8:18:30 AM] <mrsnoww> I dont get why the separate EU and NA but not console and PC
[07/21/18, 8:18:30 AM] <boatvis> Dae is up
[07/21/18, 8:18:30 AM] <MvpRoy23> 115
[07/21/18, 8:18:31 AM] <LaserdiscVision> Console should just have their own bracket with lesser money or something in that manner.
