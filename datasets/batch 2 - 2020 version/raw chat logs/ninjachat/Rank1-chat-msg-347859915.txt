[12/12/18, 7:04:54 AM] <ToxicJolt_> tbh I liked the sword.. It made people fight instead of camp.. The planes though.. yeah no

[12/12/18, 7:05:28 AM] <madcatmk02> Players on the ground I feel needed to make a pact to only shoot planes the way planes were only attacking the ground
[12/12/18, 7:05:30 AM] <JohnInSoCal> the planes were teaming which is horrible in a solo tourney, then the sword was ridiculous
[12/12/18, 7:05:30 AM] <jdubbz_212> how did you do

[12/12/18, 7:09:02 AM] <TankTime_> I think sword would have been fine if everyone started focusing the owner. no one had time to learn to counter it.
[12/12/18, 7:09:05 AM] <Sveiiin> @onehitek he was ranting about how Epic always cut to him when he died, how EpIc always comes to him when they need him but cut to him when he dies just for the views etc... and how planes and the sword are unfair for NA because EU didnt have them,..... all of it fair points but i know it will be taken apart by haters
