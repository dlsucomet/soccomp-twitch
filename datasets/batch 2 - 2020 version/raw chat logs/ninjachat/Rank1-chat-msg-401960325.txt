[03/27/19, 9:23:33 PM] <beats1122_> Casuals as for a quick play mode, get it then complain. shut up and grind to get to arena.
[03/27/19, 9:23:36 PM] <realtectony> I feel like the no health upon kill might be reverted on April fool's
[03/27/19, 9:23:38 PM] <max_udell27> What‚Äôs the update
[03/27/19, 9:23:39 PM] <fatso_m> one of the best patches... if you wanna play comp go play comp on its own playlist we have been for 7 seasons without hp and mats for kill it doesnt have to change now

[03/27/19, 9:23:56 PM] <pictongg> competitive mode is dope and pubs are WACCCKKKK
[03/27/19, 9:23:59 PM] <scikd> At first I thought this was going to be the worst update of ALL time but after I played I realized all they did was give incentive to play competitive against good players and get better. So basically they just separated the bots and the sweats. It‚Äôs actually genius. Before there was really no incentive to play competitive/ranked.

[03/27/19, 9:26:50 PM] <adshotta> epic is really smart by doing this they are separating the casuals and the sweats

[03/27/19, 9:26:59 PM] <ienstein> no matter what you think, there will always be sweats in pubs, believe what you want tho
[03/27/19, 9:26:59 PM] <kruiscontrol> They did this so they would force players to play in arena
