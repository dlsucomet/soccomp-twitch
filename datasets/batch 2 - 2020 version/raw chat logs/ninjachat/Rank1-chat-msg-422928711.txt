[05/10/19, 10:30:32 PM] <awatchmen> It was in the patch notes, but this game encourages cqc. Obviously most kills are going to be with a shotgun and the tac was ass
[05/10/19, 10:30:36 PM] <mattyjoe0706> yup
[05/10/19, 10:30:36 PM] <Cascanashy> Anyone think the new shotgun sounds like a dog barking when someone else shoots it lol
[05/10/19, 10:30:39 PM] <NateMega> Tbh if the tommy wasnâ€™t added the pump probably wouldnâ€™t have been vaulted
[05/10/19, 10:30:43 PM] <dylpicklezzz> So if the drop rate is 26% does that mean 1 out of every 4 chests u open will have a tommy?
[05/10/19, 10:30:44 PM] <4d_gamer> @baka_47 for one gun out of every weapon in the game? yea it is. you want everything around 12%
