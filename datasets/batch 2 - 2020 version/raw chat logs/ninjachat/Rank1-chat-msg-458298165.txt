[07/27/19, 1:50:28 AM] <thecdawgskingdom> Ninja really should have had someone at his house start his stream on a PC there. Figured Epic would give the players PCs that didn’t have enough memory to play FN and stream at same time.
[07/27/19, 1:50:29 AM] <MrEuropeanTv> Soon it’ll say ninja went offline
[07/27/19, 1:50:29 AM] <redmsb> Epic trying to get view records for sure
