[06/7/17, 5:19:18 PM] <qaz0r> @dinmammayey idk why you're telling people to buy different kind of game on a stream about another game lol

[06/7/17, 5:19:37 PM] <DanesGame> @rfkey you don't reload in a firefight looking directly at an enemy. No perks irl
[06/7/17, 5:19:47 PM] <Wolfyyyt> @KiLLoLoGY06 Nah, for low specs, nop.
