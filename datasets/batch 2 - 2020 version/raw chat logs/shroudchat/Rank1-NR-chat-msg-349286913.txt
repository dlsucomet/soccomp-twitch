[12/15/18, 1:54:43 PM] <Peakiex> The sensors should point at your play area, should be able to see each other as well. The sensor has a wide angle and covers a wide area.
[12/15/18, 1:54:46 PM] <macflanks> then lower you base stations
[12/15/18, 1:54:46 PM] <Celtic222> @shroud theyre suppose ro point at each other, i have the vive too. Usually when you see the wall or floor blinking that means youre out of the field or close to it.
