[02/13/19, 10:24:02 AM] <autofocused> Go watch King Richard's VOD if you think I'm lying. The rules clearly state you can't die on purpose or throw matches. I had Dizzy's stream up as well while watching the tournament and one of the matches Ninja and Dizzy got killed and finished. King Richard had 1/5th health and just ran out and fought a 1v2 for a reset. Technically by the rules of the tournament that's cheating.
