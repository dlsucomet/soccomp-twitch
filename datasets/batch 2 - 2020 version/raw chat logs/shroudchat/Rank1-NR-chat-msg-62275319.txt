[04/23/16, 12:58:40 PM] <chubsmagee1> The penis is constructed of spongy tissue that becomes erect when it fills with blood during sexual arousal. It facilitates sexual intercourse and delivery of semen in the vagina during ejaculation. The ejaculate contains approximately 3.5 milliliters of semen (seminal fluid + sperm) and 400,000,000 sperm
