[05/5/16, 5:44:25 PM] <BmAngwar> SKEEZ_, while that is true overwatch is not really that much of a fps. which is why it's shooting mechanics are not that difficult and why it shiouldn't even be compared with cs. totally different games. the skill ceiling lies more in teamwork, positioning and playing smart than aim and mechanics.
