[05/20/16, 2:04:11 PM] <MrGoodkatGaming> I think inferno and cobblestone need to go. In these maps chickens are killed recklessly and without remorse. Chat keeps shouting PETA but no action is taken. I think we need to take them out of the competitive map pool to put a stop to this slaughter and show we are serious.
