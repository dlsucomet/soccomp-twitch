"The rebroadcast is sometimes played using Twitch's playlist feature. It basically works like Youtube playlists where it will just play a series of queued videos on a loop. The channel won't appear as being online when using the playlist and there is no way to schedule when certain VODs will play, it just goes straight from one VOD to the next. The playlist doesn't work on some devices, so try switching to something else if your current device isn't working with it.",neither,0.03360893224395954,0.38668587883118577,0.5797051889248547
