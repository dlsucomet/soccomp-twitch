"@chaoticloony I think, perhaps, it depends on the conventions you may have played at/with.

"@chaoticloony (cont'd) It's kind of like how ""Feats"" (though called different things  by different groups) existed for over a decade before 3rd came out; I know several groups I played with, personally, started using a ""Special Abilities"" house-rule since '88 (which were essentially what were later called Feats by 3rd).
