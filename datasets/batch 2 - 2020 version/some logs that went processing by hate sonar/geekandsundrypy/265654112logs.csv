@HawkeyeNFO ohhhh like a moon pool. no the pressure of the water wouldnt move you back but it would be difficult to move into depending on the depth and by connection the pressure of the water because with enough force you would move the water out of the way. the only way it could move you back would be if there was an underwater current moving against you,neither,0.04324722276588434,0.3536826945411918,0.603070082692924
