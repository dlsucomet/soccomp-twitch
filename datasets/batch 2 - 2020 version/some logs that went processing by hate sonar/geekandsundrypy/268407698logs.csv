@That_One_Guy212 i thinka reasonable explanation would be the symbiont is given a name based on the first host. So till they are joined they have no name. then they take on the first or last name of the first host that way the first host needs no name change,neither,0.035593754141495834,0.33686613338393107,0.6275401124745731
